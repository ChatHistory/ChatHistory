[2016-11-20 07:02:10] <abhisekp> But the real question is how did he end up in this room 
[2016-11-20 07:46:47] <t-mullen> The "disable" link for the new theme doesn't seem to work :/
[2016-11-20 08:40:45] <alexanderjulo> Hey guys, I am currently unable to create a community
[2016-11-20 08:40:57] <alexanderjulo> whatever slug I try to choose it always says it is unavailable
[2016-11-20 08:41:02] <alexanderjulo> without further explanation
[2016-11-20 08:41:12] <alexanderjulo> do you have any idea what I could be doing wrong?
[2016-11-20 08:42:06] <alexanderjulo> This only seems to happen when I try to create a community from a repo
[2016-11-20 08:42:10] <alexanderjulo> otherwise it works fine
[2016-11-20 08:43:01] <alexanderjulo> it also looks like there is a normal dialogue first and that is then overwritten with a full-screen dialogue with background colors and such things
[2016-11-20 12:22:30] <alexanderjulo> This does not apply to the non-repo bases communities
[2016-11-20 12:22:34] <alexanderjulo> which seem to be fine
[2016-11-20 15:36:07] <abdulhannanali> <3 the new things with gitter

[2016-11-21 02:33:15] <Aaawesomealex> How would I run the program C++? (the simplest way) There are so many programs for one language. If someone can pm me to help me step by step itd be greatly appreciated
[2016-11-21 02:44:13] <lc-soft> How to set a different logo for each chat room?
[2016-11-21 06:00:46] <ghost~5826a72ed73408ce4f354d4f> lc-soft: its not allowed as of now..
[2016-11-21 06:01:45] <lc-soft> Oh, no ...
[2016-11-21 06:48:39] <lc-soft> how to upload image ?
[2016-11-21 07:31:47] <ghost~5826a72ed73408ce4f354d4f> lc-soft: double click on thumbnail.. it will open up for selecting images
[2016-11-21 09:51:26] <alexanderjulo> Is there actually anyone from gitter doing support here at all?
[2016-11-21 12:06:05] <MadLittleMods> alexanderjulo: Fix underway [<-ISSUE->] 
[2016-11-21 12:09:54] <MadLittleMods>  November 20, 2016 1:46 AM @RationalCoding There is no disable link to turn off the theme changes.You can toggle between light and dark http://blog.gitter.im/2016/11/17/join-the-dark-side/
[2016-11-21 12:11:04] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @lc-softYou can't set individual avatars for rooms but you can change the avatar for your community by clicking the avatar in the chat header at the top and browseing for the desired file
[2016-11-21 14:00:47] <alexanderjulo> MadLittleMods: thanks!
[2016-11-21 14:55:02] <TheDiamondYT1> I get a HTTP 400 error code
[2016-11-21 14:55:08] <TheDiamondYT1>  [<-LINK->] 
[2016-11-21 18:22:45] <dragon788> it appears that non-favorites in the All Conversations list aren't maintaining their sort if you "refresh" the webpage or close and reopen
[2016-11-21 18:23:34] <MadLittleMods> dragon788: non-favourites don't maintain a manual drag and drop sort. Youcansort them kinda but not supported
[2016-11-21 18:35:35] <dragon788> ahhh, ok
[2016-11-21 18:35:52] <dragon788> guess I'll have to make my favorites list huge then :)
[2016-11-21 19:13:04] <Elbullazul> Hi there.  Just want to ask what happened to the topics thing,  it seems it went offline
[2016-11-21 19:33:59] <grahamperrin> Anyone, please: how doesstagingrelate toNext? I have the bookmarklet to toggle  but when Next is enabled I can't see [<-LINK->] .
[2016-11-21 19:35:43] <grahamperrin> More generally, when I toggle off (away from Next), I don't see any change in the GUI but the appearanceisconsiderably different from what I recall of things a few weeks ago.
[2016-11-21 19:36:56] <grahamperrin> grahamperrin: toggles on again … there's the green NEXT indicator but apart from that indicator, I can't see the difference between off and on.
[2016-11-21 19:38:17] <mydigitalself> At the moment there's no difference between the two. If an issue is closed, its generally in full production.
[2016-11-21 19:39:37] <grahamperrin> OK@mydigitalselfwith [<-ISSUE->] as an example, I see no scroll bar for search results. Do you?
[2016-11-21 19:40:16] <mydigitalself> Dunno, on mobile and my laptop battery is dead and left my charger at the office
[2016-11-21 19:40:56] <mydigitalself> If you don't see it, comment on the issue with details on your platform, could be os/browser specific.
[2016-11-21 19:42:20] <grahamperrin> Firefox 49.0 (loaded with extensions) on TrueOS Desktop, which tracks FreeBSD-CURRENT. I'll start the browser in safe mode and review. Back in five.
[2016-11-21 19:48:05] <mydigitalself> Yeah... that's not an environment we test on, so wouldn't be surprised if it was platform specific bug.
[2016-11-21 19:48:43] <grahamperrin> OK, now there's a (terribly faint) scroll bar. Maybe an extension conflict :(
[2016-11-21 19:50:48] <grahamperrin> Still in safe mode, the bar appears only if the left menu is toggled to 'make the space for results persistent'beforea search is performed.
[2016-11-21 19:51:37] <grahamperrin> And if search results are not cleared before that toggle, then (still) there's no scroll bar.
[2016-11-21 19:51:42] <grahamperrin> grahamperrin: clears search results
[2016-11-21 19:52:22] <grahamperrin> Still no scroll bar for search results. Weird.
[2016-11-21 20:04:09] <grahamperrin> Now with Chromium, and just one extension (LastPass). Still no scroll bar.
[2016-11-21 20:25:37] <grahamperrin> Now back to normal mode for Firefox, loaded with extensions.The problem persists and (fingers crossed) I have a workaround that's good in both Chromium and Firefox:zoom in [<-CODE->]

[2016-11-22 06:25:53] <zacts> hi
[2016-11-22 06:26:33] <zacts> The one missing feature of Gitter I would like to see is the ability to search through room history
[2016-11-22 06:26:44] <zacts> I see this: [<-ISSUE->] 
[2016-11-22 06:26:58] <zacts> I wonder how long it might be before we see this feature implemented?
[2016-11-22 06:27:24] <zacts> other than that I prefer gitter over slack
[2016-11-22 07:12:55] <matrixbot> @lok:matrix.orgAny channel operator here?
[2016-11-22 07:16:03] <ghost~5826a72ed73408ce4f354d4f> discourse has slack chat plugin ... is there nay plans for gitter plugin for same?
[2016-11-22 10:27:59] <mydigitalself> zacts: you can search the current room, not across rooms. use the search icon to the left.
[2016-11-22 12:25:15] <pdurbin> mydigitalself: is there an issue tracking having a feature to search across rooms?
[2016-11-22 12:31:51] <mydigitalself> yip, it's very old, but could always do with more 
[2016-11-22 12:31:52] <mydigitalself>  [<-ISSUE->] 
[2016-11-22 12:41:51] <pdurbin> thanks, I subscribed
[2016-11-22 12:52:39] <mydigitalself> did you 
[2016-11-22 12:52:41] <mydigitalself> ?
[2016-11-22 13:06:44] <pdurbin> no. how many +1's do I get? :)
[2016-11-22 13:07:29] <mydigitalself> hah, always helpful to +1 an issue you want
[2016-11-22 13:14:06] <pdurbin> I'd love to hear what you think of this idea: [<-LINK->] 
[2016-11-22 13:17:09] <mydigitalself> i don't think people will stack rank, but just having a web-based tool you can connect to a repo via oAuth and then show most popular issues based on (reactions - although consider reactions haven't been around since the start), on comments that have +1 and just total number of comments could be an interesting little free tool and see where it goes.
[2016-11-22 13:18:24] <pdurbin> yeah
[2016-11-22 13:19:20] <pdurbin> What if I could open up my own custom view of any projects issue tracker on GitHub and drag the "cards" (issues) around into the "right" order from my point of view. And what if everyone could do this for the same project. I think it's potentially powerful.
[2016-11-22 13:20:00] <pdurbin> By "cards" I'm talking about a Kanban board like Trello or Waffle.
[2016-11-22 13:21:41] <mydigitalself> because not everyone will do it, and you have all this powerful historic data - and indeed data where people just don't know about this other thing and treating one as more important than the other has issues i think.
[2016-11-22 13:21:56] <mydigitalself> it's like self selection bias for the loud minority
[2016-11-22 13:24:09] <pdurbin> So to measure customer demand, you sort by +1's? Even this feature of GitHub issues is relatively new. It's a hard problem.
[2016-11-22 13:25:20] <mydigitalself> well REACTIONS are new
[2016-11-22 13:25:30] <mydigitalself> being able to   in a comment is not
[2016-11-22 13:25:46] <mydigitalself> so you'd need to somehow stitch these things together
[2016-11-22 13:26:10] <pdurbin> yeah
[2016-11-22 13:26:23] <mydigitalself> you could have a DurbinScore(tm) where it combines reactions, comments with   and even just total number of comments (shows it's active). and then maybe show each separately in a column too and you can order by either one.
[2016-11-22 13:26:51] <mydigitalself> also maybe add some time-based weighting to it
[2016-11-22 13:27:20] <mydigitalself> e.g. it's been around for 1 year and has 10  vs something that's been around for 2 months and has 10  is maybe more important
[2016-11-22 13:27:38] <mydigitalself> so velocity effectively
[2016-11-22 13:29:59] <pdurbin> yeah, people used to have the wrong incentives... it used to be they could only leave comments on github issues... so people would just type "+1" as a comment
[2016-11-22 13:48:55] <Mikaela> Mikaela: wishes the reactions came to GitHub mobile web and API too so it didn't need remembering what to on desktop and it could be clicked in Octodroid which is also missing subscribing thanks to API not having it
[2016-11-22 13:49:59] <mydigitalself> Mikaela: it's available in preview via the API
[2016-11-22 13:50:00] <mydigitalself>  [<-LINK->] 
[2016-11-22 13:50:04] <mydigitalself> look below the payload
[2016-11-22 13:51:25] <Mikaela> I mean subscribe to email notifications
[2016-11-22 13:53:43] <mydigitalself> wishes the reactions came to GitHub mobile web and API tooyou said exactly that
[2016-11-22 13:53:58] <mydigitalself> and then went on to say more about subscriptions in the API
[2016-11-22 13:54:14] <mydigitalself> and i'm saying that reactions is coming to the API and you can preview it
[2016-11-22 13:54:38] <Mikaela> Sorry, I confused, that could probably be thrown to octodroid tracker
[2016-11-22 14:02:40] <divyanshdubey> Hey there everyone ... is there any group on gitter that discus about c or c++?
[2016-11-22 14:21:44] <mydigitalself> divyanshdubey: pleasedo notcreate new communities and randomly add people you don't know into them. you are welcome to share a link ingitterHQ/developersto your new community, but what you just did is not cool.
[2016-11-22 14:32:13] <Mikaela> It looks like they were aware and I wasn't subscribed to the issue [<-ISSUE->] 
[2016-11-22 14:53:36] <pdurbin> ah, there's [<-LINK->] too. interesting
[2016-11-22 15:13:10] <leni1> Hello. How do you scroll up or down in a room?
[2016-11-22 15:13:27] <TheDiamondYT1> leni1: Mouse wheel or the scroll bar on the right of the chat
[2016-11-22 15:13:44] <leni1> TheDiamondYT1: using a touchpad :P
[2016-11-22 15:14:03] <leni1> No keyboard shortctuts?
[2016-11-22 15:14:15] <leni1> Like using the up or down arrows or something?
[2016-11-22 15:14:18] <TheDiamondYT1> Pg Up and Pg Down work
[2016-11-22 15:14:41] <leni1> Yes... That's what I was looking for. Thank you
[2016-11-22 15:14:57] <leni1> TheDiamondYT1: thanks
[2016-11-22 15:15:24] <TheDiamondYT1> Anyway, why not use this its possible on a touchpad
[2016-11-22 15:34:02] <zacts> mydigitalself: Nice, thanks! re: searching chat room history
[2016-11-22 15:34:17] <mydigitalself> 
[2016-11-22 15:34:27] <mydigitalself> there are some issues with the search infrastructure today, it's not returning all results properly
[2016-11-22 15:34:36] <zacts> ah ok
[2016-11-22 15:38:15] <MadLittleMods> ^ reference [<-ISSUE->] 
[2016-11-22 17:40:38] <abhisekp>  I see a box in Windows 7 Starter 32b SP1
[2016-11-22 17:42:55] <viluon> That's the glorious XboX
[2016-11-22 17:43:09] <abhisekp> ah! :D
[2016-11-22 17:43:10] <viluon> Please talk to Micro$oft about that@abhisekp
[2016-11-22 17:44:32] <dragon788> abhisekp: that is likely a UTF/unicode character that your current browser/font selection doesn't understand
[2016-11-22 17:44:59] <dragon788> iirc Windows Starter didn't have all the language packs available that Home/Pro/Enterprise did
[2016-11-22 17:46:12] <abhisekp> hmm... ok.. thanks@dragon788 :D
[2016-11-22 17:57:09] <TheDiamondYT1> Is that just on my name?
[2016-11-22 17:57:13] <TheDiamondYT1> Or everyones
[2016-11-22 18:00:38] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @abhisekpLooks like it doesn't like the emoji [<-LINK->] 
[2016-11-22 18:00:52] <MadLittleMods> TheDiamondYT1: ^^   [<-LINK->] 
[2016-11-22 18:02:11] <abhisekp> TheDiamondYT1: it's not just you, it's same for all users notifications in this OS.
[2016-11-22 18:03:25] <abhisekp> well, i remember seeing this  some days ago... though. I don't know what changed in these days 
[2016-11-22 18:04:04] <abhisekp> Computers are weird. Things happen automagically without notifying the user :( 
[2016-11-22 18:42:35] <TheDiamondYT1> Can someone check api chat i need some more help
[2016-11-22 20:05:13] <raniesantos> if i delete my message on gitter does it stay on other people's threads?
[2016-11-22 20:05:22] <abhisekp> no
[2016-11-22 20:05:30] <raniesantos> thanks
[2016-11-23 00:19:08] <dragon788> raniesantos: I think the only place the message will exist is if somebody was subscribed to instant notifications via email on a channel
[2016-11-23 08:47:07] <matrixbot> Mikaela wonders if the Matrix bridge stores it, edits appear at least and it supports redacting so it should probably disappear
[2016-11-23 08:50:57] <matrixbot> @lok:matrix.orgHow to set up matrix bridge
[2016-11-23 09:34:43] <DutchMarcel> Hey Gitter, can you please remove the 'Show unread item counts' from the 'Announcements: Notify me for mentions and announcements' notification setting? I'm getting spammed with 'unread messages' emails. In my opinion 'announcements' are only about direct or /all mentions!
[2016-11-23 10:43:29] <mydigitalself> DutchMarcel: the email notification system is still fairly legacy and needs some much more significant change to bring it up to speed with desktop & mobile logic
[2016-11-23 11:14:20] <DutchMarcel> mydigitalself: Thanks for the update. I don't have the desktop version running all the time, but for know I'll just turn the email notifications off...
[2016-11-23 12:01:01] <lamusique> Hello, I wonder how to rename my community because I can't find any feature on Gitter.
[2016-11-23 12:14:42] <TheCodingMeatball> hi does anyone know how i change an image through the css folder on my github website? thanks
[2016-11-23 12:48:48] <lydatech> is there a way to block someone from PMing you?
[2016-11-23 12:50:12] <mydigitalself> @lydatech not explicitly, but you can effectively do it by muting the conversation, unless they start @ mentioning you in the PM...is someone harassing you?
[2016-11-23 12:50:52] <lydatech> not me. a user in our group but it hasnt been an issue yet
[2016-11-23 12:51:35] <mydigitalself> if there's any issue, don't hesitate to report it to us here orsupport@gitter.imwith any logs/account info.
[2016-11-23 12:54:33] <lydatech> mydigitalself: will do. Thank you
[2016-11-23 13:47:09] <abhisekp>  Can someone please explain me why does it say this?UDP like you just dont care :D
[2016-11-23 13:51:58] <mydigitalself> it's sort of like an MOTD, there are about 20 of them that randomly display
[2016-11-23 13:52:07] <mydigitalself> but more just a bit of fun
[2016-11-23 13:57:27] <cbj4074> LOL. That's funny to anyone who knows the difference between UDP vs. TCP.
[2016-11-23 14:00:17] <gerald23> @ what is UDP?
[2016-11-23 14:02:33] <cbj4074> User Datagram Protocol. It's a networking thing.
[2016-11-23 14:03:15] <abhisekp> Is the joke because it is less secure protocol?
[2016-11-23 14:03:45] <cbj4074> Not exactly; there is no handshake to guarantee that the data arrives intact (whereas with TCP, there is)
[2016-11-23 14:03:53] <abhisekp> ah!
[2016-11-23 14:04:01] <cbj4074> Imagine Netflix streaming... you don't care if every packet makes it over the wire intact.
[2016-11-23 14:04:03] <gerald23> cbj4074: @abhisekpOK.Then it means,you. lock it inside a cupboard and forget it.
[2016-11-23 14:04:18] <abhisekp> yeah! read about UDP while Torrenting ;P
[2016-11-23 14:04:25] <cbj4074> Exactly, hehe!
[2016-11-23 16:00:47] <matrixbot> @lok:matrix.orgAnyone from operator?
[2016-11-23 16:42:43] <mydigitalself> What for?
[2016-11-23 16:45:11] <ghost~5826a72ed73408ce4f354d4f> Its Matrix bot?
[2016-11-23 16:46:05] <matrixbot> @lok:matrix.orgWant to see how to route gitter channel to  Matrix
[2016-11-23 16:46:09] <matrixbot> @lok:matrix.orgMike Bartlett (Gitter):
[2016-11-23 17:27:43] <Saeven> Are Gitter badges still available?  Found an old blog post from 2014...
[2016-11-23 17:28:02] <Saeven> I can't find a combination of [<-LINK->] that works
[2016-11-23 17:29:05] <MadLittleMods> @Saeven Markdown readme badges? Yes [<-CODE->] 
[2016-11-23 17:29:35] <Saeven> MadLittleMods: Thanks for writing back man.  When I do that, I only see Twizzles, FAcebox, LinkedIn and G+
[2016-11-23 17:30:21] <Saeven> Just a C+P kinda deal
[2016-11-23 17:31:20] <mydigitalself> lok:matrix.org no idea we have no official affiliation with matrix they just use our API best to ask them
[2016-11-23 17:31:27] <MadLittleMods> Saeven: That section only shows for public rooms connected to a GitHub repo
[2016-11-23 17:31:33] <Saeven> gotit
[2016-11-23 17:35:01] <Saeven> MadLittleMods: is there something I can RTFM somewhere?  I went to Integrations > GitHub, done the necessary, still no markdown badge.  The room is public ( [<-LINK->] )
[2016-11-23 17:37:38] <mydigitalself> That's just adding GitHub activity to your room
[2016-11-23 17:38:15] <mydigitalself> When you first created the room, did you create it linked to the repo? If not, you'll just have to craft the markdown yourself
[2016-11-23 17:38:39] <mydigitalself> You can tell by clicking the options button (top right-ish) and choose share this room
[2016-11-23 17:39:00] <mydigitalself> If you see a markdown badge and a PR button, the room is mapped to a GitHub repo
[2016-11-23 17:39:19] <mydigitalself> There's currently no way to change this mapping after the fact.
[2016-11-23 17:40:14] <joejulian> You know... WRT the UDP joke above.... Youhadto know that some people would not get it. :D
[2016-11-23 18:15:15] <mydigitalself> ;)
[2016-11-23 20:09:53] <jouni_kantola_twitter> i've tried to find how i can change my username./nickisn't listed as a valid cmd, and can't find anything in the KB. anyone?
[2016-11-23 20:15:35] <MadLittleMods> jouni_kantola_twitter: There isn't a way to change just your Gitter username. It is whatever your Twitter/GitHub account is (you can change it there)
[2016-11-23 20:16:49] <jouni_kantola_twitter> but that isn't my Twitter acc name, it's onlyjouni_kantola. the suffix_twittergot appended automatically
[2016-11-23 20:19:46] <MadLittleMods> jouni_kantola_twitter: The suffix is just how Twitter users are mapped to avoid collisions with GitHub users. No way to get around it while using Twitter
[2016-11-23 20:21:04] <jouni_kantola_twitter> ok. guess i'll have to settle with what i got then. thanks,@MadLittleMods.
[2016-11-23 20:43:53] <sellout> When I mouse over a room icon, it says “upload new avatar”, but I see no way to actually do that. Is it actually possible to give a room an avatar distinct from the user/org?
[2016-11-23 20:44:32] <MadLittleMods> sellout: You can only update a community avatar.
[2016-11-23 20:44:53] <sellout> MadLittleMods: Cool. Thanks.
[2016-11-23 21:12:47] <revisualize> Who works on the design for the layout. It does NOT work for touch devices like my Surface Pro 4.
[2016-11-23 21:13:56] <revisualize> I have a large list of one on one conversation and I'm not even able to scroll through the list.
[2016-11-23 21:17:55] <MadLittleMods> revisualize: Expand on "I'm not even able to scroll through the list.". Testing it now and I assume it is because the drag and drop is kicking in
[2016-11-23 21:20:18] <revisualize> Yeah.
[2016-11-23 21:20:48] <revisualize> It isn't just with my finger ... It also happens with my mouse.
[2016-11-23 21:20:55] <revisualize> Little touchpad thing.
[2016-11-23 21:23:30] <MadLittleMods> revisualize: Drag and drop happens when trying to scroll with trackpad? What fingers/gestures are you using?
[2016-11-23 21:25:33] <revisualize> Index finger on the trackpad.
[2016-11-23 21:25:43] <revisualize> Cause I'm lazy.
[2016-11-23 21:26:03] <MadLittleMods> revisualize: Please expand. Does it just not scroll or are you activating the drag and drop, etc
[2016-11-23 21:26:19] <revisualize> Sorry... I'm trying to do two things at once.
[2016-11-23 21:26:33] <revisualize> Let me end one and I will answer this. 15seconds. brb.
[2016-11-23 21:27:00] <revisualize> Okay. Let me try to explain a little better.
[2016-11-23 21:28:32] <revisualize> So, I have the menu collapsed. When I try to click my one on one conversations. It opens a pop out. When I try to scroll through that list by trying to select the sliver of a light grey scroll bar.. It jumps off and then collapses the menu. This is with using my index finger on the screen and while using my trackpad.
[2016-11-23 21:29:11] <revisualize> If I try to just do the screen to flick through the scroll... It activates the drag and drop feature.
[2016-11-23 21:30:19] <revisualize> I am able to use the scroll bar if I expand the menu first.
[2016-11-23 21:31:10] <revisualize> However, I'm not able to use my finger to scroll through even with the menu expaned.
[2016-11-23 21:31:18] <revisualize> MadLittleMods: Does that help a little?
[2016-11-23 21:31:49] <revisualize> I work in IT.. You'd figure I'd be more descriptive in the first place.
[2016-11-23 21:36:34] <MadLittleMods> revisualize: I don't have a Windows device with a touch screen or fancy trackpad like the Surface but trying out my old laptop(probably needs a synaptic driver which would help) and having a lot of difficulty. Mind filing two separate issues? One for difficulty scrolling with touch screen because of drag and drop. One for difficulty scrolling with trackpad on Windows. [<-LINK->] 
[2016-11-23 21:36:53] <MadLittleMods> My main platform is a Windows desktop
[2016-11-23 22:01:18] <revisualize> MadLittleMods: Sure I could do that.. Should I maybe make a video of the process?
[2016-11-23 22:01:40] <MadLittleMods> revisualize: A gif for each scenario would be great
[2016-11-23 22:02:18] <revisualize> MadLittleMods: Shooting a video on my phone would be easier. But, I can see what I can do.
[2016-11-23 22:02:35] <revisualize> It'll take me a couple days.
[2016-11-23 22:02:44] <revisualize> You know.. Holiday 
[2016-11-23 22:03:23] <MadLittleMods> revisualize: Easily convert the video to gif on Imgur [<-LINK->] or the other services (perhaps manually in Photoshop)
[2016-11-23 22:04:15] <MadLittleMods> I can take care of it after the fact if you can't get something cooking
[2016-11-23 22:06:30] <revisualize> I'll make magic happen.
[2016-11-24 03:00:04] <Saeven> How do we delete Communities we’ve created?
[2016-11-24 03:01:35] <Saeven> I took the intuitive route, but they still appear in the “Add a Room” dialog
[2016-11-24 03:01:59] <MadLittleMods> Saeven: There isn't a way to delete communities yet
[2016-11-24 03:03:03] <Saeven> I was trying to link up some GitHub repos (was you couldn’t change that setting post-create). So I deleted similarly-named rooms.  Now I can’t create them it seems, probably because it thinks the names are taken
[2016-11-24 03:03:44] <MadLittleMods> Saeven: What are the room names? Link the repo
[2016-11-24 03:04:00] <Saeven> repo: [<-LINK->] 
[2016-11-24 03:04:55] <Saeven> and here’s the mess I’ve got going on hehe [<-LINK->] 
[2016-11-24 03:06:15] <MadLittleMods> Saeven: That room doesn't exist. The issue in the screenshot indicates you need to fill in the room name, start typing the name of the repo and select it
[2016-11-24 03:07:10] <Saeven> How did I end up with two Circlical communities?
[2016-11-24 03:09:19] <Saeven> I was truly, just trying to link the rooms up to make the markdown badge work
[2016-11-24 03:10:16] <MadLittleMods> ahh, sorry didn't notice that part. Is it duplicated even when closing the modal and bringing it back up? Does it happen on refresh/restart?devtools are available in the desktop app but... Open it up in a browser so we can debug this better. In the devtools network tab, when you pop the create room modal, what groups come back in the/v1/user/:userId/groups?type=adminresponse?
[2016-11-24 03:10:50] <Saeven> yea it happens on restart, both in the desktop client and the web
[2016-11-24 03:13:26] <Saeven>  [<-CODE->] 
[2016-11-24 03:15:28] <Saeven> MadLittleMods: let me know if there’s anything else I can grab
[2016-11-24 03:15:36] <Saeven> andthank you very much for your help
[2016-11-24 03:17:01] <MadLittleMods> Saeven: One is [<-LINK->] which is based on theSaeven/zf3-circlical-userGitHub repo  and the other is [<-LINK->] which is based on theCirclicalGitHub org
[2016-11-24 03:17:52] <Saeven> the third is a throwaway?
[2016-11-24 03:18:47] <MadLittleMods> I assume you knew what the third one is because it has a different name. [<-LINK->] is also based on theSaeven/zf3-circlical-userGitHub repo
[2016-11-24 03:19:14] <Saeven> so many communities can be linked to a same repo?
[2016-11-24 03:19:33] <Saeven> however, community names have to be distinct?
[2016-11-24 03:19:41] <MadLittleMods> Yes, name, URI, and associated GitHub project are pretty independent
[2016-11-24 03:19:50] <MadLittleMods> Only the URI has to be distinct
[2016-11-24 03:20:19] <Saeven> I feel dirty with all these communities registered! ;)  Is delete functionality on the horizon? :)
[2016-11-24 03:20:37] <MadLittleMods> Eventually, but which one would you like to keep?
[2016-11-24 03:22:10] <Saeven> what’s required to make the markdown badges work?
[2016-11-24 03:22:23] <Saeven> simply a link to one or more repos?
[2016-11-24 03:22:54] <Saeven> in my dreamworld, I’d have /Circlical (5813fc7bd73408ce4f31955f) and a bunch of MD badges in my repos that lead to it
[2016-11-24 03:23:18] <Saeven> but it seems the repo is associated to community, and not to room?
[2016-11-24 03:23:25] <MadLittleMods> Because you are trying to create a community for a repo on your personal user, your only option is to create a community based on theSaeven/zf3-circlical-userrepo and keep theLobbyroom.
[2016-11-24 03:23:40] <Saeven> I’d easily move the repo to the org
[2016-11-24 03:23:56] <MadLittleMods> You can have a badge for any room. It's just that the share modal only shows the template for public rooms associated with a repo  [<-LINK->] 
[2016-11-24 03:25:06] <Saeven> so, I should create rooms within Circlical/ and then handcraft the badges into the markdown
[2016-11-24 03:25:26] <Saeven> and when the day comes, I delete those two other communities to soothe my OCD
[2016-11-24 03:25:26] <MadLittleMods>  That would work
[2016-11-24 03:25:51] <Saeven> alright, sorry to be so daft.  I did look for documentation a priori! ;)
[2016-11-24 03:25:53] <MadLittleMods> I can delete the others now, [<-LINK->] and [<-LINK->] 
[2016-11-24 03:26:05] <Saeven> oh man.     thank you
[2016-11-24 03:27:15] <MadLittleMods> done 
[2016-11-24 03:27:29] <Saeven> thanks a ton man

[2016-11-25 18:11:13] <abdulhannanali> I created the chat room but  I still can't remove a person
[2016-11-25 18:11:20] <abdulhannanali> It's a private chat room
[2016-11-25 18:11:49] <abdulhannanali> It'd be awesome if some one can help
[2016-11-25 18:12:17] <abdulhannanali> I am not getting a Remove option when I hover over the person image. I am getting that for other channels under same namespace :/
[2016-11-25 20:20:47] <burning-monk> texas2010: lance how long is the ban
[2016-11-26 00:15:52] <RandalSchwartz> Safari on Mac doesn't recognize your cert.
[2016-11-26 00:16:28] <RandalSchwartz> And also loops on "sign in to start talking"
[2016-11-26 00:16:55] <RandalSchwartz> And OSX app crashes on login screen.
[2016-11-26 00:17:09] <RandalSchwartz> Only app that works is ios.
[2016-11-26 00:17:18] <RandalSchwartz> Sad. :(
[2016-11-26 19:27:47] <burning-monk> texas2010: answer me
[2016-11-26 19:31:28] <texas2010> burning-monk: if you need to talk to me. then pm me.
[2016-11-27 00:52:00] <RandalSchwartz> Is this support for gitter itself?
[2016-11-27 02:35:42] <jermbone1000_twitter> Hi I'm new to the community. It's nice to be here, I am just starting to work with Linux any advice would be greatly appreciated
[2016-11-27 02:57:24] <wavesup> Hi anyone awake
[2016-11-27 03:07:59] <matrixbot> @lok:matrix.orgYes
[2016-11-27 03:08:04] <matrixbot> @lok:matrix.orgWhy would I host anything on my phone? It's battery powered, keeps changing networks, is usually sitting behind a firewall with NAT…
[2016-11-27 03:08:23] <matrixbot> @lok:matrix.orgCan someone explain me how firewall and nat is related to phone?
[2016-11-27 03:10:12] <matrixbot> @lok:matrix.orgGitter chat support p2p chat?
[2016-11-27 15:31:35] <ghost~5826a72ed73408ce4f354d4f> jermbone1000_twitter: check BSD systems 
[2016-11-27 18:17:14] <anddam> hello
[2016-11-27 18:18:08] <anddam> I'm using gitter's irc gateway and from the irc client I don't see an user that's actually on channel and is talking with me
[2016-11-27 18:18:44] <anddam> he is not in the nickname list, i tried disconnecting from irc.gitter.im and connecting again to no avail
[2016-11-27 18:19:23] <anddam> the user is signed in using a twitter account, I haven't had any issue (that I noticed) with github-signed users
[2016-11-27 18:19:36] <anddam> can anyone check this and confirm it's an issue of the irc service?
[2016-11-27 21:15:46] <pdurbin> I think from IRC you only see people connected from IRC in the nick list.
[2016-11-28 00:23:44] <josepagan> hello does anyone know how to install the gitter app with manjaro/arch?
[2016-11-28 04:23:46] <abhisekp> pdurbin: AFAIK only top 32 people are shown in IRC
[2016-11-28 07:38:51] <anddam> abhisekp: why?
[2016-11-28 07:39:41] <abhisekp> idk... gitter devs would know the reason
[2016-11-28 15:04:28] <pdurbin> oh, ok
[2016-11-28 15:40:10] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @MikaelaThis room is for Gitter support, not Matrix. Probably best to get some support in their room
[2016-11-28 15:40:58] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @abdulhannanali/remove @username, perhaps you aren't an admin of the room anymore
[2016-11-28 15:41:24] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @RandalSchwartzYes
[2016-11-28 15:41:32] <Mikaela> I don't think anyone asked For Matrix support
[2016-11-28 15:41:51] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @RandalSchwartzI am not seeing any issues with the certs in Safari
[2016-11-28 15:42:25] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @MikaelaThe message I pointed to shows that you were missing a message using the Matrix bridge
[2016-11-28 15:44:10] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @anddamWe only show the first 32 people in a room but you should be getting messages from anyone in the room
[2016-11-28 16:36:02] <RandalSchwartz> Are you testing on 10.9?
[2016-11-28 16:36:20] <RandalSchwartz> And I get the same problem with Chrome.
[2016-11-28 16:38:02] <matrixbot> MikaelaEric Eastwood (Gitter): the link doesn't work on Gitter mobile client. And IIRC I tested a few days ago if the bridge was working here or not as one message got missed and got to conclusion that it worked and apologised for testing explaining what I was doing and where one could possibly get more information if they were interested.
[2016-11-28 16:53:01] <abhisekp> matrixbot: you should use@usernameto mention a user.
[2016-11-28 16:53:26] <matrixbot> MikaelaAbhisek Pattnaik (Gitter): what is the username?
[2016-11-28 16:53:32] <matrixbot> Mikaelaposted an image:
[2016-11-28 16:54:13] <abhisekp> 
[2016-11-28 16:55:40] <abhisekp> MadLittleMods:  [<-LINK->] Even admins are unable to remove users which are created by some other admins for a private org. room.
[2016-11-28 16:57:44] <abhisekp> matrixbot: what kind of chat client is that?   [<-LINK->] It doesn't show the usernames.My username isabhisekp
[2016-11-28 16:59:02] <abhisekp> matrixbot: You can mention me using@abhisekp
[2016-11-28 17:00:25] <abhisekp> That client looks great though 
[2016-11-28 18:08:37] <dragon788> anddam: Twitter Oauth'd users show up as their Twitter handle with _twitter appended, this can be completely unrelated to their name, GitHub allows this as well but most people use something that is somewhat similar between their GH Username and their name (though not always)
[2016-11-29 01:28:39] <Yoimer> Good morning everyone
[2016-11-29 01:28:49] <Yoimer> May God Bless you
[2016-11-29 01:29:02] <Yoimer> Good evening* lol
[2016-11-29 01:29:52] <Yoimer> Please let me know if you copy me
[2016-11-29 01:30:38] <marchdown> Copy
[2016-11-29 01:32:28] <marchdown> Huh what am I even doing here it's the middle of the night where I am and I'm not even a Gitter dev. Although, I would gladly get involved if someone were to help me get started.
[2016-11-29 01:34:30] <Yoimer> Lol
[2016-11-29 01:34:52] <Yoimer> Man I came to share a project I'm working on
[2016-11-29 01:35:07] <Yoimer> It is about BLE in Python
[2016-11-29 01:35:31] <Yoimer> We are using Raspberry Pi with Raspbian
[2016-11-29 01:35:51] <Yoimer> We basically want to monitor people using Beacons
[2016-11-29 01:36:08] <Yoimer> I've already finished the BLE reading
[2016-11-29 01:36:30] <marchdown> Cool.
[2016-11-29 01:36:34] <Yoimer> I could paste the code here if someone needs to
[2016-11-29 01:37:12] <Yoimer> We can share the IDE and all the working configuration for anyone
[2016-11-29 01:37:57] <Yoimer> We mapped a drive through a Virtual Machine. That's how we make full debugging
[2016-11-29 01:38:08] <marchdown> Better use gist or keep the ide config along with the code in your repo.
[2016-11-29 01:38:37] <Yoimer> From Windows we program and test on Linux
[2016-11-29 01:39:04] <Yoimer> We commit the mapped drive with Git
[2016-11-29 01:40:31] <Yoimer> Komodo IDE allows to debug not touching or importing any lib on the Python script
[2016-11-29 01:40:47] <Yoimer> Just through pydbgp
[2016-11-29 01:40:59] <Yoimer> God am I alone here ?
[2016-11-29 01:41:00] <Yoimer> Lol

[2016-11-29 03:46:37] <apottr> I'm using the web client now
[2016-11-29 03:46:47] <apottr> nor was I running both at the same time
[2016-11-29 04:36:02] <Yoimer> Did Allison leave?
[2016-11-29 05:01:46] <abhisekp> yes, Allison left us... 
[2016-11-29 09:53:42] <serapath> Hi. I wonder if somebody could help me out. We are using gitter chat for our free coding camps and the app is running under [<-LINK->] with the gitter chat integrated. In the past - before we had all of this set up, we were borrowing the chat [<-LINK->] and would like to close it and transition all of its members to [<-LINK->] 
[2016-11-29 09:53:57] <serapath> can i do that or can somebody help me with that?
[2016-11-29 14:20:44] <MadLittleMods> serapath: Send a message tosupport@gitter.im. We usually only handle transferring messages over
[2016-11-29 15:23:29] <cahidkaya> hi i have some problem about gitter
[2016-11-29 15:23:44] <cahidkaya> xprop doesnt give me gitter's wm_class
[2016-11-29 15:24:07] <cahidkaya> i am using i3wm so i need that for assing it to my workspace
[2016-11-29 16:02:11] <MadLittleMods> cahidkaya: See [<-ISSUE->] 
[2016-11-29 16:34:32] <cahidkaya> thank you@MadLittleMods
[2016-11-29 16:42:27] <lydatech> Is there a way to view a list of currently in place bans for a chat?
[2016-11-29 16:43:56] <MadLittleMods> lydatech: Not in the UI but you can get a list viahttps://gitter.im/api/v1/rooms/:roomId/bans, [<-LINK->] 
[2016-11-29 16:44:15] <lydatech> MadLittleMods: thank you
[2016-11-29 17:10:06] <engradeelnayyar> hello every one
[2016-11-29 17:25:14] <sriranganathan> Hello everyone. I am new to gitter. I created a new private chat room today. When I try to add someone It results in a "Forbidden" message. The user I am trying to add has already made the membership of the organization public and has already allowed private access for the organization. Can someone help me 
[2016-11-29 17:27:13] <MadLittleMods> @sriranganathan hmm, it sounds like you have taken the correct steps so far. The room is based on a private repo?You mentioned "has already allowed private access for the organization"(could be interpreted as the third party access org setting) but has the user granted private repo scope? http://i.imgur.com/VKSgK5D.png
[2016-11-29 17:29:55] <sriranganathan> MadLittleMods: Thank you for the prompt reply. I will ask him to check this 
[2016-11-29 18:29:49] <enjoythecode> Hi guys! Just joined gitter for free code camp today and I wonder who hosts gitter
[2016-11-29 18:30:28] <enjoythecode> Can someone tell me if they know?
[2016-11-29 19:41:22] <MadLittleMods> enjoythecode:  [<-LINK->] 
[2016-11-29 19:43:46] <enjoythecode> MadLittleMods: thanks
[2016-11-30 06:27:45] <serapath> MadLittleMods: hey... regarding the chat and transferring of messages. maybe thats good enough. Because i guess i can add/invite all the learners to the new channel easily. If in addition, the old channel is being deleted or forwards to the new one, thats fine. But i guess i still need to write tosupport@gitter.im?
[2016-11-30 07:43:13] <grahamperrin> gitterHQ/gitter#1410 is closed but I can not reliably use Gitter with tabs with Firefox.The symptom demonstrated in the screen recording at https://gitter.im/trueos/Random?at=583e48b3381827c24d9a83ea (Firefox 49.0 in safe mode on FreeBSD-based TrueOS) is reproducible with Firefox 50.0.1 in safe mode on pre-release Mac OS X 10.12.2 (16C53a). Two tabs, each of which was refreshed in safe mode before its screenshot:

[2016-11-30 18:17:20] <adriatic> MadLittleMods: Being properly warned not to ask silly questions before RTFM (which I did) I find myself unable to add a chatroom to my existing community ( [<-LINK->] ). Is this not possible after August 2016 upgrade - or am I just missing access privilege?
[2016-11-30 18:31:07] <mydigitalself> adriatic: when you click onAdd a roomdo you not see Monterey Framework in the community drop-down?
[2016-11-30 18:35:03] <adriatic> @mydigitalselfI only see the smal [<-CODE->] icon (bottom left) which results with the "create a new community" prompt. Nowhere to find theAdd a room
[2016-11-30 18:35:47] <mydigitalself> on the left menu, to the right of the+icon
[2016-11-30 18:36:00] <mydigitalself> the+icon is to create a whole new community
[2016-11-30 18:36:05] <onewithlifee_twitter> hey guys, can someone help me with my code?
[2016-11-30 18:37:57] <adriatic> mydigitalself: there is nothing to the right of the+icon - in any of my communities (that I created)
[2016-11-30 18:38:26] <mydigitalself> onewithlifee_twitter: a) no, you're in the wrong room, when you joined this room, the welcome message would have said exactly what this room is for, please don't ignore those messagesb) you can join [<-LINK->] c) it's better to not ask your question like that, paste asmallamount of your code, using markdown and specify what the problem you are having is and someone may help you.
[2016-11-30 18:38:34] <mydigitalself> adriatic: can you send me a screenshot of your Gitter?
[2016-11-30 18:43:14] <adriatic> Here goes
[2016-11-30 18:43:48] <adriatic>  [<-LINK->] 
[2016-11-30 18:44:36] <mydigitalself> adriatic: seriously...
[2016-11-30 18:44:37] <adriatic> I found the answer, of course - and I would suggest to publish this in the online help on communities and rooms
[2016-11-30 18:45:01] <mydigitalself> there's a button at the bottom right, to the right of the+icon that saysAdd a room
[2016-11-30 18:45:58] <adriatic> mydigitalself: - it seems that you did not read my added comment, where is stated the same 
[2016-11-30 18:46:21] <mydigitalself> yip, i saw it after typing mine ;)
[2016-11-30 18:47:00] <Bluscream>  [<-LINK->] 
[2016-11-30 18:47:01] <Bluscream> Almost invisible ...
[2016-11-30 18:47:34] <adriatic> mydigitalself: - I know the feeling (having to read too many chats at once, it is easy to miss some details)
[2016-11-30 18:47:36] <mydigitalself> the issue is that button doesn't show on the community view - which it should, it used to
[2016-11-30 18:47:39] <adriatic> Thanks much
[2016-11-30 18:48:34] <mydigitalself>  [<-ISSUE->] 
[2016-11-30 18:48:49] <Bluscream> Are there something like DMCA's or name claims for communities?
[2016-11-30 18:49:56] <adriatic> mydigitalself: thanks Mike - love your reaction speed
[2016-11-30 18:52:59] <mydigitalself> @BluscreamDMCA has no relevance for community names. DMCA is specifically for content violations where circumvention of rights management is being distributed such as PirateBay, KAT (closed as a result of a DMCA case & arrest), Popcorn Time etc...It criminalizes production and dissemination of technology, devices, or services intended to circumvent measures (commonly known as digital rights management or DRM) that control access to copyrighted works.if there's a name violation that's infringing on a trademark infringement a legal precedent would need to be established if the use is happening beyond Gitter. if the use is unique to Gitter, evidence of a registered trademark and infringement would need to be established.
[2016-11-30 18:53:55] <Bluscream> ah thanks ok i was afraid i can't claim my company's name
[2016-11-30 18:54:44] <mydigitalself> you'd have to have an internationally recognised EU trademark
[2016-11-30 18:55:09] <Bluscream> okay, the error message seems pretty neat btw..
[2016-11-30 18:55:24] <mydigitalself> like we don't even havetwitter.com/gitter- tough luck for us
[2016-11-30 18:55:52] <Bluscream> The red mark doesn't tell me much :(
[2016-11-30 18:55:59] <mydigitalself> you should normally see a tooltip
[2016-11-30 18:56:31] <mydigitalself>  [<-LINK->] <--- that's basically preventing you from using that URL
[2016-11-30 18:56:53] <Bluscream> oh it checks for taken github user/org names?
[2016-11-30 18:56:55] <mydigitalself> can maybe try something like adquardHQ as your url
[2016-11-30 19:22:58] <Bluscream> Is there a special reason why there is no alpha channel allowed in upload avatars?
[2016-11-30 19:23:20] <Bluscream> That makes all avatars look ugly with the dark design
[2016-11-30 19:50:56] <MadLittleMods> Bluscream: Alpha channel is just fine but we put a white box behind avatars so that avatars coming from GitHub still look nice and readable
[2016-11-30 19:51:32] <Bluscream> Is that some css magic?
[2016-11-30 19:52:16] <MadLittleMods>  background-color: #ffffff;
[2016-11-30 19:55:39] <Bluscream> Yeah but i ask myself in which css file
[2016-11-30 19:58:34] <Bluscream> Clipboard is not enabled in hosted mode. Please inspect using chrome://inspectREEE xD
[2016-11-30 20:00:01] <Bluscream>  [<-CODE->] 
[2016-11-30 20:00:14] <Bluscream> There we go
[2016-11-30 20:44:34] <Bluscream> MadLittleMods: there must be more

[2016-11-30 20:51:04] <Bluscream>  [<-CODE->] atleast enough to get most of the images transparent :)
[2016-11-30 21:06:59] <Bluscream> this won't ever work xD

[2016-11-30 21:12:42] <grahamperrin> Does anyone use Gitter in more than tab with Firefox?
[2016-11-30 21:22:40] <MadLittleMods> grahamperrin: What is happening?
[2016-11-30 21:25:17] <grahamperrin> MadLittleMods:  [<-LINK->] mismatches between URL and content. Risks arising include: chat that's intended to be private, inadvertently posted to a public room (it happened to me a day or so ago).
[2016-11-30 21:28:11] <MadLittleMods> grahamperrin: Either [<-ISSUE->] or [<-ISSUE->] 
[2016-11-30 21:30:23] <grahamperrin> More than [<-ISSUE->] ; the symptoms persist long after state is restored. Refresh, refresh, refresh and so on and the mismatch persists.
[2016-11-30 21:32:21] <MadLittleMods> grahamperrin: So [<-LINK->] extension issue?
[2016-11-30 21:33:55] <grahamperrin> No, there's safe mode above in [<-LINK->] and in the screen recording that's mentioned there.
[2016-11-30 21:36:27] <grahamperrin> effects can include apparent search failures e.g. as shown at https://discourse.trueos.org/t/-/110/8
[2016-11-30 21:37:18] <MadLittleMods> grahamperrin: Definitely want to to tackle [<-ISSUE->] to see how that changes things
[2016-11-30 21:37:47] <grahamperrin> 
[2016-11-30 21:42:29] <grahamperrin> Re: investigation [<-LINK->] if Firefox behaviour is proper (andglancingat the shot of Google Chrome in [<-ISSUE->] , Iassumethat itisproper), then maybe someone will have the rather thankless task of tooth-combing for areas where caching should/must be disallowed.
[2016-11-30 21:47:59] <grahamperrin> … and on that potentially depressing note (sorry!) I'll say goodnight ~~~~
[2016-11-30 21:51:28] <grahamperrin> ^ hint: that example of anapparentsearch failure is in fact, on very close inspection, a mismatch between the URL/Lobbyand the room/lumina… both the title bar and the tab are strong indications that the writer is in one room when in fact, the writing is elsewhere.
[2016-11-30 21:58:19] <grahamperrin> … and when in the Lobby at an?at=URL, both the title bar and the tab are diminished to a generic 'Gitter'; a more distinctive title e.g. 'TrueOS lobby' would be appropriate.
[2016-12-01 00:31:46] <Bluscream> Wait, why can't i find the repo for the android app?
[2016-12-01 00:35:55] <dragon788> Bluscream: it might currently be closed source while they are working through the kinks
[2016-12-01 00:39:56] <dragon788> it appears to be a private repo currently, [<-LINK->] 
[2016-12-01 00:42:01] <dragon788> they are tracking any mobile client issues through the main repository attached to this channel though
[2016-12-01 01:18:04] <Bluscream> Damn thats confusing, thanks for info tho@dragon788
[2016-12-01 05:30:36] <lydatech> A suggestion: When a moderator deletes a message there should be a notice to the chat something along the lines of " This message has been removed by So-and-so"
[2016-12-01 05:31:32] <lydatech> Is there any way to do something like this?
[2016-12-01 06:46:57] <grahamperrin> @lydatech I'm relatively new to Gitter, have not yet encountered moderation but for what it's worth, I would prefer:(a) discretion by default; absence of a public notice.Why not public? Because a notice could be interpreted (by all readers) as penalising a person for an offence of unknown severity.Better for a writer to be discreetly (not publicly) given the opportunity, the encouragement, to express something in a way that will not invite repeat moderation.
[2016-12-01 06:52:15] <lydatech> grahamperrin: That makes sense. It was a topic that was brought up. You have given an eloquent way of putting my thoughts. Thank you
[2016-12-01 07:10:11] <grahamperrin> @MadLittleMods hmm https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter?at=583f43bd8e29aeee601b4bbd above I wrote "mismatches between URL and content", which is:(1) obviously true for both screenshots at https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter?at=583e831116207f7b0ec2dec3, where – in the absence of a title bar – (iii) the title within the tab of Firefox in safe mode does not match (ii) the URL immediately below the curve of the tab; and (iv) the room below the URL does not match (ii) the URL but does match (iii) the title within the tab
(2) less obviously true for the first screenshot at https://discourse.trueos.org/t/pros-and-cons-of-gitter/110/7, where all three of (i) title bar, (ii) URL and (iii) traditional (rectangular and not-on-top) tab are in accord with each other, but there's a mismatch between those three and (iv) the room below the tab.
[2016-12-01 07:10:13] <sludge256> At the very least, there should be a moderation log accessible by admins.
[2016-12-01 07:48:03] <grahamperrin>  [<-CODE->] An automated notice will be effective only if I browse, browse, browse until that notice becomes visible.I'm more likely to (magnifying glass icon) seek a memorised keyword, or key phrase, and – particularly if a room is noisy – not stumble across any automated notice. Because the notice is not likely to contain what's key to me. [<-CODE->] 
[2016-12-01 11:47:59] <joeblew99> Basic question !! How can i setup gitter so it ONLY gives me notifications for where i am mentioned ?? I want to set this globally for all my gitters
[2016-12-01 13:36:42] <mydigitalself> joeblew99: go to notification settings,  in any room, click onConfigure Defaultschange it toMutedone.
[2016-12-01 14:25:37] <dragon788> per what@mydigitalselfsaid you can also apply that as the default to all rooms after setting it for one, or at least there is a link there@joeblew99

[2016-12-01 18:31:07] <MadLittleMods> anddam:  [<-LINK->] 
[2016-12-01 18:32:20] <anddam> thanks
[2016-12-01 18:45:35] <anddam> I was looking for that 32 nicks limit per chan, I thought it was hardcoded
[2016-12-01 18:46:27] <MadLittleMods> anddam: You can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2016-12-01 18:48:37] <anddam> I see, so the API returns a certain amount of nicks (30 default) and the client doesn't know/has a concept it needs to query all the nicks through pagination
[2016-12-01 18:51:41] <anddam>  [<-ISSUE->] and [<-ISSUE->] are both closed is following those useful? I mean are they still going to be updated?
[2016-12-01 19:00:10] <dragon788> the first is still open, probably the second was closed but linked to the first as a duplicate
[2016-12-01 19:00:41] <dragon788> if you aren't using the Gitter.im web client you might not see the colored links, but they have lovely green for still open and red for closed
[2016-12-01 19:07:14] <grahamperrin> grahamperrin: lurves the couleurs
[2016-12-01 19:09:39] <dragon788> grahamperrin: I think I hit a similar issue to what you've seen, I was in a channel, I popped over to another channel that had activity, went back to my initial channel to type a reply, but when there was more activity from the one that had blipped, that activity ended up showing up in my "original" channel, so I didn't actually send the reply as I wasn't sure where the heck it would go
[2016-12-01 19:36:30] <grahamperrin> Yeah it can become wildly confusing.
[2016-12-01 19:56:44] <____ymd_____twitter> I dont how its work? I'm in Europe and I had just a few channel that is normal guys?
[2016-12-01 19:56:56] <____ymd_____twitter> Thanks for reply me! ;)
[2016-12-01 22:45:08] <tamsky> So, is there need to report unable to connect to tcp/irc.gitter.io:6667, or is that a known issue?

[2016-12-02 15:42:48] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] 
[2016-12-02 15:44:18] <grahamperrin> Yep Mike I do. Until today I never had a private conversation apparently mixed with public content.
[2016-12-02 15:44:47] <mydigitalself> yeah, i've seen that happen before withchat-cachewhich is why it's not ready for prime-time
[2016-12-02 15:45:06] <mydigitalself> i'd turn it off
[2016-12-02 15:45:08] <grahamperrin> AFAIR this incident occurred after Firefox automatically restored tabs.
[2016-12-02 15:45:40] <mydigitalself> also, what time zone are you in? trying to establish when thatengradeelnayyarpinged you

[2016-12-02 16:32:48] <dragon788> when parsing URLs to show gists/Github code, would it be possible to check whether an [<-LINK->] URL points to a gist and resolve that as well? would probably take a HEAD request to get the redirected dest URL and then use that to match the parser rules

[2016-12-02 21:40:29] <krzysztof> Hello, I have an API authentication question: Is it possible to reset the personal access token, or generate a new token and use it like a personal access token?
[2016-12-02 21:41:22] <krzysztof> It seems rather risky to just have one PAT per account (in case of it leaking anywhere)
[2016-12-02 21:41:26] <MadLittleMods> krzysztof: There is [<-LINK->] btw. There isn't a way to regenerate your personal access token. But if it leaks, we can reset it manually for you

[2016-12-03 00:10:07] <michaelneale> Hey would it ever be possible that IRC access could be allowed to not require signup (for non private rooms, perhaps as opt in?)
[2016-12-03 01:17:11] <pdurbin> like freenode
[2016-12-03 01:17:22] <michaelneale> yes
[2016-12-03 01:17:30] <michaelneale> exactly like freenode
[2016-12-03 01:17:41] <michaelneale> of course, I do also use freenode, but everyone loves gitter more
[2016-12-03 01:19:58] <pdurbin> Really? I like Gitter a lot but I think I'll always have a soft spot for freenode. I especially like the public logging of channels Gitter does, which is something that freenode doesn't have or even encourage by default.
[2016-12-03 01:20:13] <michaelneale> me too - but for smoething I am working on gitter works better
[2016-12-03 01:24:39] <pdurbin> I wouldn't mind having some sort of bridge from Gitter to my freenode channel, which I already have public logging for. I would consider my logs to be canonical. I wouldn't care if Gitter logs the channel as well. It's more about having an easy way for people to jump into the channel and start talking.
[2016-12-03 01:25:03] <michaelneale> We tried sameroom.io which is close - but makes it come through one user, which is odd.
[2016-12-03 01:27:52] <pdurbin> Yeah, I haven't quite been satisfied with the user experience so far. For now, I just stook up an instance of Shout so people have an easy way to connect to the freenode channel from a web browser. No freenode captcha, no having to think about which channel to join. You just pick a username and start talking. Works pretty well.
[2016-12-03 01:34:46] <pdurbin> The user experience of the various "sync freenode and Gitter" solutions, I mean.
[2016-12-03 01:53:26] <pdurbin> I guess the "coming through as one user" problem is sort of mentioned as "Neither IRC nor Gitter provide an impersonation API for posting messages with a different author name" at [<-LINK->]

[2016-12-04 08:06:58] <Tconcept22> Hi
[2016-12-04 08:07:19] <Tconcept22> It's a new day
[2016-12-04 08:08:19] <Tconcept22> I need someone to help me through C# language to write and develop an app
[2016-12-04 08:08:29] <Tconcept22> ftbenconcept@gmail.com
[2016-12-04 10:13:04] <grahamperrin> mydigitalself: re: [<-LINK->] I'm in the UK.
[2016-12-04 10:15:35] <grahamperrin> Tconcept22: this room is complementary to [<-LINK->] for help with Gitter
not for help with languages.
[2016-12-04 11:46:26] <Tconcept22> OK sorry
[2016-12-04 11:58:50] <serapath> hey ho :-)@MadLittleMods
[2016-12-04 11:59:42] <serapath> I haven't heard back from the support yet, but tomorrow and during the whole next week we will host 5 events in different spaces to introduce people to JavaScript in free WizardAmigos code camps. It would be great to use the new chat room already. Do you think it might happen in time?
[2016-12-04 12:54:37] <khanh2003> Hello everyone!Is there any kind of sandbox room for me to test gitter's Markdown?Also I don't really like Gitter's Unread indicator and at slash all mentions as it force me to read messages that are unrelated to me.
[2016-12-04 12:57:21] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] found by clicking the globe icon at the head of the page
[2016-12-04 12:58:53] <grahamperrin> khanh2003: are you using a web browser?
[2016-12-04 13:00:49] <khanh2003> grahamperrin: oh it is not really obvious to new users. showing list of rooms when going to gitter.im homepage is better [my-2-cents]
[2016-12-04 13:06:37] <grahamperrin> MadLittleMods: and team, observe this pale green indication long after the post was read by me:
[2016-12-04 13:06:48] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] 
[2016-12-04 13:10:06] <grahamperrin> Maybe caused by (i) browsing away from this room then simply (ii) back, without (iii) actively reloading the page. I'll test whether it's reproducible with Firefox with a new profile.
[2016-12-04 13:13:58] <khanh2003> grahamperrin: you are right.
[2016-12-04 13:14:59] <grahamperrin> khanh2003: did you use Firefox in safe mode? Or with a new (clean) profile?
[2016-12-04 13:20:47] <khanh2003> grahamperrin: i tried. it is reproducible.I am the person who open issues but never Pull Request
[2016-12-04 13:21:52] <grahamperrin> LOL. Reproducible in with Firefox in safe mode?
[2016-12-04 16:33:25] <geekyi> grahamperrin: if you click on the pale green indication, does it go away?
[2016-12-04 16:49:26] <grahamperrin> The green does not invite clicking in normal circumstances, and was not clickable when the problem occurred.
[2016-12-04 16:54:12] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] yesterday included a mock-up of an icon that@baitisjwished for, an icon to appear (if I understand correctly) wherever a post is edited, with that edition possibly unnoticed by readers.
[2016-12-04 16:59:20] <grahamperrin> My initial concern about that suggestion was that multiple icons of that type might either:(a) unnecessarily invite superfluous clicks (if, like the green backgrounds, the icons are to automatically fade away); or 
(b) require more clicks than the user will be happy to perform (if the icons are to never fade without clicking).
[2016-12-04 21:00:41] <grahamperrin> I find it difficult to un-learn the perception that Search is uppermost:

[2016-12-05 07:44:32] <AnriKo> hello. can I ask in this chat question about git and bitbucket?
[2016-12-05 07:46:10] <Khalian> Not the correct forum but sure
[2016-12-05 07:46:35] <Khalian> Whats your question?
[2016-12-05 07:51:11] <AnriKo> I try to deploy my site in laravel from bitbucket to my host using git. I do "git clone" copy repo  but I dont understand how update my cloned repo on hosting, when I change him on bitbucket
[2016-12-05 07:52:50] <apottr> AnriKo: you can dogit pullto get the remote changes

[2016-12-05 13:27:16] <arronio_twitter> Hello! Is there a ‘Manage Account’ interface by any chance? If not, is there functionality to ‘Sign Out’ of my Twitter-linked gitter account and use GitHub for authorization instead? Thanks!
[2016-12-05 13:29:25] <arronio_twitter> (Within the OS X app itself)
[2016-12-05 13:33:52] <mydigitalself> arronio_twitter: on the OS X app, the menubar bar icon (next to your system clock, wifi settings etc…) has a signout option. you can then sign in with GitHub, this will effectively create a new account.
[2016-12-05 13:35:21] <arronio_twitter> mydigitalself: Oh dang, of course, I hid that! Thanks :)
[2016-12-05 13:47:51] <Bluscream> How to make a room invite only afterwards?
[2016-12-05 13:55:02] <mydigitalself> Bluscream: you can't change the room type after you've created it
[2016-12-05 13:55:29] <Bluscream> So i have to delete and recreate the whole room? :/
[2016-12-05 13:55:38] <Bluscream> That's not very user-friendly
[2016-12-05 13:56:24] <mydigitalself> it's just not something that's implemented yet
[2016-12-05 13:56:55] <mydigitalself> i can count on one hand the number of times it's been requested, and i don't have an abnormally large number of fingers ;)
[2016-12-05 14:24:11] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @BluscreamCreate a new issue [<-LINK->] 
[2016-12-05 14:50:49] <burning-monk> is gitter blocking to show site information?
[2016-12-05 14:51:56] <MadLittleMods> burning-monk: Can you ask that in another way? I don't quite understand what you are asking about
[2016-12-05 14:53:23] <burning-monk> normally in firefox there is the option at the left of the address bar to show page information
[2016-12-05 14:54:17] <MadLittleMods> burning-monk: We aren't blocking it. It works for me in Chrome and Firefox
[2016-12-05 14:54:47] <burning-monk> ok then I guess it's an issue with my browser
[2016-12-05 15:48:45] <Bluscream> Which browser are you using?
[2016-12-05 15:55:52] <burning-monk> firefox
[2016-12-05 15:57:17] <matrixbot> @lok:matrix.orgHare Krishna (Gitter): hi
[2016-12-05 17:27:29] <burning-monk> what?
[2016-12-05 20:35:45] <lydatech> Is there a way to send yourself a message?
[2016-12-05 20:36:33] <MadLittleMods> lydatech: Probably not because you can't start a one to one with yourself
[2016-12-05 20:36:54] <lydatech> bummer it would be nice to keep notes that way
[2016-12-05 20:37:09] <MadLittleMods> lydatech: You can create a private room for yourself
[2016-12-05 20:37:31] <lydatech> duh i forgat about that. Thanks@MadLittleMods
[2016-12-05 22:02:25] <ThomasPrioul> Hi people, I love Gitter, coming from Slack. But what's really annoying is that "eyeballs" indicator. It was much clearer and more reliable in Slack which used a connection indicator. This issue [<-ISSUE->] ( [<-ISSUE->] ) was opened like two years ago, any news on an improved indicator? Thanks :)
[2016-12-05 22:04:06] <ThomasPrioul> I also experience the same as [<-ISSUE->] 
[2016-12-05 23:01:07] <julisan1> Hello world! Just joining now. Looking forward to learning a bunch from y'all!
[2016-12-05 23:01:56] <MadLittleMods> julisan1: Perhaps you meant to go to [<-LINK->] - Just curious, how did you end up in this room (retrace steps)?
[2016-12-05 23:07:50] <julisan1> MadLittleMods: , I guess you're right.
[2016-12-05 23:08:36] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] Still curious on how you got into this room after signing in if you can remember
[2016-12-05 23:16:20] <julisan1> MadLittleMods: , I was trying out suggestions provided to me by freecodecamp
[2016-12-05 23:16:45] <MadLittleMods> julisan1: Can you expand or link what you mean by suggestions?
[2016-12-06 04:12:54] <abhisekp> @MadLittleMods @julisan1 I guess these suggestions?
[2016-12-06 13:04:24] <mydigitalself> BgR8: you already posted this in another room, this room - as explained in the welcome message - isn't for general technical questions, it's for feedback and questions about gitter itself
[2016-12-06 18:32:57] <engradeelnayyar> any one know how to make popup ?
[2016-12-06 18:34:10] <engradeelnayyar> a

[2016-12-06 20:23:03] <uptownhr> anyone else having performance issues after coming back to gitter overnight?
[2016-12-06 20:23:08] <uptownhr> seems to hang and I have restart
[2016-12-06 20:23:21] <uptownhr> I have to restart gitter
[2016-12-06 20:24:31] <MadLittleMods> @uptownhr GitHub is currently down which slows things down on our end.Do you mean the application goes unresponsive?
[2016-12-06 20:24:39] <uptownhr> MadLittleMods: yes
[2016-12-06 20:25:12] <uptownhr> this didn't happen before about a month ago
[2016-12-06 20:25:16] <uptownhr> only after the new upgrade
[2016-12-06 20:26:50] <MadLittleMods> uptownhr: Which upgrade? The [<-LINK->] to the desktop client itself was 4 months ago in August but could be a change with the webapp.
[2016-12-06 20:27:23] <uptownhr> hmm
[2016-12-06 20:27:27] <uptownhr> maybe i was late to the upgrade
[2016-12-06 20:27:33] <uptownhr> but it changed for me about a month ago
[2016-12-06 20:27:42] <uptownhr> first time i noticed the entire ui change
[2016-12-06 20:27:45] <uptownhr> looks much better :)
[2016-12-06 20:28:05] <MadLittleMods> The UI change is part of the webapp, not built into the desktop client
[2016-12-06 20:28:09] <MadLittleMods> Which OS are you on?
[2016-12-06 20:28:13] <uptownhr> ubuntu
[2016-12-06 20:28:37] <MadLittleMods> Which version?
[2016-12-07 01:42:40] <jbcebe-seekers> Hi everyone
[2016-12-07 01:43:18] <jbcebe-seekers> what is the best way to share a list of rooms with my development team?
[2016-12-07 01:44:19] <jbcebe-seekers> i was looking for a way to share my profile with them... hoping it would show the list of rooms i joined or starred
[2016-12-07 04:26:12] <MadLittleMods> jbcebe-seekers: It has been mentioned internally before but there isn't a way to share a list outside of linking a community home [<-LINK->] 
[2016-12-07 08:23:56] <jbcebe-seekers> MadLittleMods: thanks Eric, how would you use the community home for that purpose?
[2016-12-07 08:24:51] <jbcebe-seekers> do you mean... just share the URL by some other mean outside Gitter?
[2016-12-07 08:26:00] <jbcebe-seekers> for example in GitHub or Twitter... you could see who I am following, which repo I starred
[2016-12-07 08:26:50] <jbcebe-seekers> I wished there was something similar... so I can show other ppl which chat room i'm in  :)
[2016-12-07 08:27:07] <jbcebe-seekers> or which one i starred
[2016-12-07 10:15:00] <davidleeuk> Hi - is there a way to change the logo image for a community?
[2016-12-07 11:40:40] <mydigitalself> davidleeuk: click on the big version of it in the header when you are in a room in that community
[2016-12-07 11:55:43] <davidleeuk> mydigitalself: tried that... nothing happens :'(
[2016-12-07 11:56:08] <mydigitalself> are you an admin of the community?
[2016-12-07 11:56:20] <davidleeuk> Yep - I set it up
[2016-12-07 11:58:32] <mydigitalself> davidleeuk: recently? what's the url of the community?
[2016-12-07 11:58:59] <davidleeuk>  [<-LINK->] 
[2016-12-07 11:59:46] <mydigitalself> and when you're in [<-LINK->] and you click on the logo at the top, nothing happens?
[2016-12-07 11:59:50] <mydigitalself> (not on the home page)
[2016-12-07 12:00:58] <davidleeuk> That's correct - I can see the link cursor but nothing happens
[2016-12-07 12:01:03] <davidleeuk> On chrome and IE
[2016-12-07 19:51:21] <mwpastore> Hi folks, I’m having trouble creating a community for one of my GitHub repos (mwpastore/sinja). It shows a red exclamation mark next to my repo name, but hovering over it doesn’t reveal any additional information. Hovering over “Next” shows a  tooltip icon; I can click on “Next” anyway but it takes me back to the initial create a new community screen with no further error messages. I’ve tried in Safari and in the Gitter app for macOS, and I’ve confirmed that my repo is not marked private and the name is not taken ( [<-LINK->] returns a 404 page). Any suggestions?
[2016-12-07 19:59:20] <mwpastore> It looks like maybe the name is too short
[2016-12-07 20:00:58] <MadLittleMods> mwpastore: It should show a tooltip with the error if you try to submit with next button or when focused in that input. It is probably a conflict with [<-LINK->] so you need to adjust the slug/URI
[2016-12-07 20:01:50] <mwpastore> a-ha, there’s a user named sinja
[2016-12-07 20:02:00] <mwpastore> yeah, it’s not showing any tooltips or errors or anything
[2016-12-07 20:04:10] <mwpastore> welp, that settles it. thanks@MadLittleMods!
[2016-12-08 10:46:20] <romildo> Is it possible to disable the top bar that appears on gitter pages on my web browser? If so, how? It takes too much space of the screen. I am referring to the bar with icons forMore rooms,FavouriteandRoom settings, among others.
[2016-12-08 14:41:16] <MadLittleMods> romildo: Nope. But you could use some styling browser extension to hide it
[2016-12-08 15:50:58] <dragon788> is there an easy way to reference another channel without the full gitter.im URL? or is that the best way?
[2016-12-08 15:53:56] <mydigitalself> that's the only way
[2016-12-08 15:55:11] <dragon788> ok, makes sense since # gives you tightly integrated GitHub issues/PRs so it wouldn't work for a channel name
[2016-12-08 16:14:33] <amberj> Hey
[2016-12-08 16:15:00] <amberj> How can I give admin permissions for a gitter organization to one more user ?
[2016-12-08 16:15:52] <amberj> I can see a "Permissions" option in every room's settings, but I want to give admin rights to this user organization-wide
[2016-12-08 16:18:24] <mydigitalself> amberj: what do you see at the bottom left of that modal?
[2016-12-08 16:20:27] <amberj> "Edit community permission".. yup this is what I was looking for. Thanks@mydigitalself
[2016-12-08 16:20:42] <mydigitalself> 
[2016-12-08 16:20:55] <mydigitalself> just add them as extra admins if the community is linked to a GitHub org
[2016-12-08 19:18:21] <mapukhakis_twitter> Good afternoon. Is there a way to Mark all messages (in a room) as read?
[2016-12-08 19:19:50] <ricardobaeta> Type "/" and look at the bottom :)
[2016-12-08 19:20:37] <mapukhakis_twitter> Ah- so easy. Thanks :)
[2016-12-08 19:44:57] <selfagency> hi, just popping into make a couple feature recommendations and to ask about a potential bug:it'd be great for there to be a way to upload an image when you're in fullscreen mode on mac. right now, you have to exit fullscreen mode to drag-and-drop. there should be a photo icon or something above the markdown symbol on the right of the text entry that opens a file selection dialog.also: it'd be great if images opened in a lightbox instead of in a browser. why direct the user out of the app to look at content shared within the app? you don't do it for issues.as for my bug question: for some reason my github integration shows every notification twice. is there a way to fix that myself or is that an issue with the integration on gitter's end?
[2016-12-08 20:17:48] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @dragon788See [<-ISSUE->] 
[2016-12-08 20:19:01] <MadLittleMods> selfagency: Take a look in your integration settings for that room (accessible via the room settings dropdown in the top-right)
[2016-12-08 20:19:18] <selfagency> MadLittleMods: it only lists one integration
[2016-12-08 20:19:37] <MadLittleMods> selfagency: hmmm, do you see multiple webhooks setup on the repo on GitHub?
[2016-12-08 20:20:08] <MadLittleMods> selfagency: File upload is only possible via drag and drop atm but adding some better controls is on our list. Mind filing an issue specifically for it though? [<-LINK->] 
[2016-12-08 20:23:14] <selfagency> MadLittleMods: yes i see three webhooks
[2016-12-08 20:23:36] <selfagency> and they all say last delivery was unsuccessful
[2016-12-08 20:24:01] <selfagency> i have gitter under services as well
[2016-12-08 20:29:18] <selfagency> i think deleting the webhooks may have worked
[2016-12-08 20:29:35] <MadLittleMods> selfagency:  You can always set them up again at anytime
[2016-12-08 23:33:18] <xex5> Jo
[2016-12-09 03:36:44] <ethanhs> Will the android app be getting a dark theme?
[2016-12-09 09:08:14] <matrixbot> Mikaela hopes so
[2016-12-09 14:17:18] <MadLittleMods> ethanhs: You can follow [<-ISSUE->] 
[2016-12-09 21:23:49] <grahamperrin> MadLittleMods: and colleagues, has anyone else reported sporadic search failures? For example, around one minute ago, seekingwebhooksin this room found nothing and there appeared a notification about communication issues.
[2016-12-09 21:26:27] <grahamperrin> A second search for the same word found some matches, and there reappeared the notification. Subsequent searches for the same word found nothing, and there reappeared the notification. For example:

[2016-12-09 21:28:39] <MadLittleMods> @grahamperrin Please refrain from pinging people directly. Anyone here can help you.It is a problem I noticed a while back and is caused by some limits we are hitting with the version of elasticsearch we are on atm iirc.troupe/gitter-webapp#2133
gitterHQ/gitter#1528
[2016-12-09 21:30:18] <grahamperrin> Apologies Eric. I'm already subscribed to [<-ISSUE->] but had not imagined the symptoms going beyond searches for usernames.
[2016-12-09 21:32:53] <MadLittleMods> Just any query that could hit the timeout
[2016-12-09 21:33:15] <MadLittleMods> Thefrom:xxxsyntax is a more involved query that reproduces the problem often
[2016-12-09 21:35:19] <grahamperrin>  [<-ISSUE->] page not found if attempt to open the issue in GitHub; and pointing at the link in this chat does not always reveal an outline of the issue in the pop-up.
[2016-12-09 21:35:34] <MadLittleMods> grahamperrin: Internal issue for my own reference
[2016-12-09 21:37:38] <grahamperrin> Ah OK. So I guess that GitHub can allow a limited view of internal issues, yes?  (Or did you make the issue private a few seconds ago?)
[2016-12-09 21:38:14] <MadLittleMods> grahamperrin: nope. It is just a private repo
[2016-12-09 21:40:57] <grahamperrin> Hmm, I did see the content of that issue (did have access) a few times when pointing at the first of your two bullet pointed links at [<-LINK->] above.
[2016-12-09 21:43:02] <MadLittleMods> grahamperrin: Screenshots if you can reproduce again please.
[2016-12-09 21:43:58] <SerafimArts> Hmmm, how escapeLaTeXLaTeXLaTeXcode?
[2016-12-09 21:44:14] <SerafimArts> \Test1Test1Test1\$\$Test2\$\$
[2016-12-09 21:44:24] <MadLittleMods> SerafimArts: Probably best to wrap in single back ticks for inline code,$$LaTeX$$
[2016-12-09 21:44:24] <SerafimArts> It does not works
[2016-12-09 21:44:58] <SerafimArts> MadLittleMods: what about without code tag? =)
[2016-12-09 21:48:05] <MadLittleMods> SerafimArts: I can't think of an other way, [<-ISSUE->] 
[2016-12-09 21:53:38] <grahamperrin> Tested in the sandbox, I can't reproduce the issue at this time. Now the link appears consistently ordinary, blue text, with no pop-up when I point. When access was granted it had the green background, indicating that the issue was open. Sometimes the pop-up was without content of the issue, instead the pop-up had an explicit message about access. I'll keep an eye open for recurrence. Eric, would you like to re-post the same two links? As before, bullet-pointed. Thanks.
[2016-12-09 22:05:29] <Guaby> Hello I'm new. But I have a question about Git.  Can I ask these type of questions here?

[2016-12-10 01:54:20] <lydatech> almost daily running firefox if i leave gitter running I get an error that a script is not running correctly. Then I have to stop it and restart gitter. The script ishttps://cdn02.gitter.im/_s/7136ee1/js/vendor.js:9is this a known bug?
[2016-12-10 06:56:34] <selfagency> our repo was converted from a personal repo to an organizational repo— how can we update our gitter to point to the new repo?
[2016-12-10 13:33:26] <severus-tux> Hello guys :D
[2016-12-10 13:36:27] <severus-tux> I need some help from any admin!. I had created this account : [<-LINK->] , which was associated with the github account severustux. But later I deleted the linked github account and opened the account  "severus-tux" and this is the one I am currently using ( [<-LINK->] ) . I would like to delete my old gitter account  ( [<-LINK->] ) but I cannot login to it as I have completely deleted the linked github account. Could someone help me ?
[2016-12-10 14:02:27] <engradeelnayyar> hello every one
[2016-12-10 14:02:45] <engradeelnayyar> i want to know how can download a website text?
[2016-12-10 14:23:49] <grahamperrin> engradeelnayyar: with respect, that's not a Gitter support question. Please seek answers in a more appropriate area; you're likely to find the question asked, and answered, at [<-LINK->] 
[2016-12-10 16:09:39] <grahamperrin> Archives here [<-LINK->] and elsewhere no longer work.
[2016-12-10 19:45:42] <sellout> In the iOS app, how can I mark all messages as read without joining a channel?
[2016-12-10 19:46:33] <sellout> Or, even better, indicate that I don't want any indications of mentions in a particular channel.

[2016-12-10 20:21:09] <lydatech> image to followup on the above question
[2016-12-10 21:06:06] <geekyi> grahamperrin: archives working for me.. maybe fixed since you asked
[2016-12-10 21:09:52] <geekyi> lydatech: never got that error for me on firefox 51.0b6 win 10 64bit. Then again, I don't usually run for over a day. Pressingdebug scriptand finding more details about the error might help?
[2016-12-10 22:04:53] <grahamperrin> Best map present but no heat, no presence of archived content
[2016-12-10 22:05:15] <grahamperrin> Heat map
[2016-12-10 22:52:48] <geekyi> Works for me, I can see the "heat", the green coloured blocks; can also browse archives. No errors in console?
[2016-12-11 08:56:47] <grahamperrin>  [<-CODE->] 
[2016-12-11 09:10:26] <grahamperrin> That was from reproduction of a cold and empty heat map with an almost new Firefox profile on FreeBSD-based TrueOS Desktop; nothing other than LastPass installed. Since then I have reproduced the problem with Firefox on Android for both [<-LINK->] and [<-LINK->] 
[2016-12-11 09:13:00] <grahamperrin> Now with TrueOS Desktop I see what's expected, maybe thanks to a Control-F5 reload without cached content).
[2016-12-11 09:16:43] <grahamperrin> Android, now:https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter/archives/all looks OK, maybe thanks to a reload
https://gitter.im/trueos/Lobby/archives/all remains cold and empty after ten or more consecutive reloads.
[2016-12-11 09:17:07] <grahamperrin> grahamperrin: closes the test instance of Firefox
[2016-12-11 09:19:26] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] 
[2016-12-11 09:20:18] <grahamperrin> Attention to the notifications. I suspect that this problem will not occur if I use WebKit-based QupZilla …
[2016-12-11 09:39:00] <grahamperrin> My suspicion was wrong. Screen recording to follow.
[2016-12-11 09:46:07] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] 
[2016-12-11 10:21:04] <grahamperrin> A recording of the problem in GNOME Web. One of two linked archive pages (both opened before I began recording) was cold and empty until, whilst recording, I reloaded the page:
[2016-12-11 10:21:14] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] 
[2016-12-11 10:27:17] <grahamperrin> chat-cache was unexpectedly enabled. I'm certain that this preference was not set by me, because I was warned that the feature causes problems:
[2016-12-11 10:27:31] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] 
[2016-12-11 11:52:31] <grahamperrin> Maybe the problem affecting some views of archives falls under "any query that could hit the timeout"
[2016-12-11 21:47:03] <geekyi> @grahamperrinhttps://gitter.im/trueos/Lobby/archives/all remains cold and empty after ten or more consecutive reloads.yep I'm having problem as #1528 i.e. network issues, it seems specific to that room. I'm on chrome; not using gitter.next

[2016-12-12 20:16:50] <barringtonbear> Anyone know a graphic file manager utility like WinDirStat that will allow me to group select files? In WinDirStat you can only select one file or folder at a time :(

[2016-12-13 17:16:13] <dragon788> seems a lot of people end up in here by accident
[2016-12-13 17:20:42] <ctcrnitv> using the gitter app, can’t apply  notification settings
[2016-12-13 17:20:50] <ctcrnitv> no apply button
[2016-12-13 17:22:53] <MadLittleMods> skr5e: What version of macOS are you on? I assume you are using the desktop client on an older version of OSX. You can simply use a slash command/notify-announcementsor download the NW.js based client [<-LINK->] 
[2016-12-13 17:24:24] <ctcrnitv> Thanks@MadLittleMods
[2016-12-13 18:22:43] <AlexandreBonneau> Hey, I'm trying to add the github repository activity to the gitter autoNumeric channel, but as a collaborator (with write access to the official repo), I only see my own repo and forks. Why is that?
[2016-12-13 20:09:48] <dragon788> you probably need to be an Administrator/Owner in order to add the gitter hooks
[2016-12-13 21:12:49] <MadLittleMods> AlexandreBonneau:  [<-LINK->] and I assume you want activity from [<-LINK->] - You would need to have admin permissions to add a webhook. Because it is a repo on another user, they might need to add it themselves because there isn't any third party application access like on an org.You could setup a custom webhook integration and give them the URL to add in the GitHub interface
[2016-12-14 03:09:32] <Syirrus> hi
[2016-12-14 04:19:44] <AlexandreBonneau> MadLittleMods: ok thank you
[2016-12-14 05:02:00] <AmazeCPK> I'm having a problem with git, and am wondering if someone can help me
[2016-12-14 05:50:25] <ajaysapkota> which CMS is best for making ecommerce websites ?
[2016-12-14 05:52:33] <MadLittleMods> AmazeCPK: @ajaysapkotaThis room is for Gitter support, not general technical support. Please read the welcome messages when joining a room and mind the room description/topic at the top in the chat header before chatting. You can try [<-LINK->] but would be good to [<-LINK->] to improve your message and have a better chance at getting a response
[2016-12-14 05:53:18] <ajaysapkota> MadLittleMods: thanks for the suggestions
[2016-12-14 07:01:54] <Khalian> hey i had a quick question
[2016-12-14 07:02:10] <Khalian> how do i get the chat on gitter markdown tag like you have on your github site
[2016-12-14 07:02:19] <Khalian> for our site ?
[2016-12-14 07:04:08] <MadLittleMods> Khalian: Room settings -> Share this chat room has a section if it is a public room connected to a repo. Here is the snippet you can replace your room with [<-CODE->] 
[2016-12-14 08:45:41] <TheCodingMeatball> does anyone know anything about performance testing?
[2016-12-14 09:50:23] <grahamperrin> Performance of Gitter? If it's not a Gitter support question, please ask elsewhere. Thanks.
[2016-12-14 09:56:51] <grahamperrin> Mods: if it's possible to customise the theme for rooms and topics in the [<-LINK->] area, consider something more restrained than the blazing purple gradient for the header. I strongly suspect that the blaze discourages people from paying attention to the pale text. (I'm usually very good at paying attention to titles and other things near the tops of pages/windows but I confess, when I first arrived in this room, an extraordinarily long time passed before the header text got the attention that it deserved.)
[2016-12-14 10:02:27] <grahamperrin> Maybe subliminally the mind switches off as if it's an advertising banner. There's the logo not once, but twice, and the second is a vivid cherry red/pink colour, and the word gitter appears three times with the first instance SHOUTED.#saccadeBrand, BRAND, BRAND, brand/brand, please blah blah blah(if you know what I mean; no offence).
[2016-12-14 11:26:35] <intellix> just my monthly moan that rooms should be open by default:Went to: [<-LINK->] Thought, I have an issue, wanna discuss it, so I change URL to: [<-LINK->] - 404.... now what?
[2016-12-14 11:28:07] <mydigitalself> intellix: don't understand the issue - public is the default permission when creating a room
[2016-12-14 11:28:36] <intellix> the issue is 404 when renaming a github repository URL to gitter, because the owner hasn't opted into creating a room: [<-ISSUE->] 
[2016-12-14 12:20:47] <ghost~55e5d0c90fc9f982beaf4f21> Have any one got this problem ? [<-ISSUE->] 
[2016-12-14 12:23:01] <ghost~55e5d0c90fc9f982beaf4f21>  [<-LINK->] 
[2016-12-14 12:42:58] <geekyi> hardw0rk: In practice, that hasn't been a problem for me. You can always@mention, and the mentioned user responds in his own time. You can also check msgread bystatus if you have to
[2016-12-14 12:44:16] <geekyi> In essence, gitter has a different chat dynamic from other messaging clients, and I like the way it currently is
[2016-12-14 12:46:01] <ghost~55e5d0c90fc9f982beaf4f21>   we also use featureread byto replace feature online status
[2016-12-14 12:47:38] <geekyi> Btw, I'm not saying that isn't a bug. But if that online presence feature was removed (butread bywas still there) I wouldn't personally miss much
[2016-12-14 12:49:03] <geekyi> Partly to do with the fact that there are about hundreds of people in a chat
[2016-12-14 12:49:47] <geekyi> Compared to other more personal chats..
[2016-12-14 12:53:30] <geekyi> Maybe subliminally the mind switches off as if it's an advertising banner.For me, it's the large difference in contrast that's jarring. The dark theme is much softer and better on the eyes
[2016-12-14 12:53:44] <geekyi>  [<-LINK->] 
[2016-12-14 17:16:13] <Maxels88> I am having an issue where I either leave, or type /leave in a channel, and as soon as a message is posted to the channel it pops back up in my conversations list
[2016-12-14 20:22:14] <grahamperrin> Maxels88: the web interface, yes? Do you use GitterNextand if so, is chat-cache enabled?
[2016-12-14 20:23:09] <Maxels88> grahamperrin: I think I figured it out. I stumbled on some irc interface and had that hooked up. leaving the channels on my irc client seem to have stopped the auto rejoins
[2016-12-14 20:23:41] <Maxels88> thanks for the follow up though
[2016-12-14 21:17:21] <cbj4074> Anyone know how the Gitter link parsing logic is implemented? Will a pasted linkusuallyshow the actual URL to which it points? (I sayusuallybecause it seems that links to certain locations -- GitHub at least -- are treated specially, withAvailable on GitHub. Or is this behavior over which the user has control via Markdown?)
[2016-12-14 21:17:42] <cbj4074> My concern is the potential to click on a malicious link that is disguised as something else.
[2016-12-14 21:18:54] <MadLittleMods> cbj4074: You can link any piece of text to somewhere else [<-LINK->]  [<-CODE->] 
[2016-12-14 21:19:42] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] 
[2016-12-14 21:19:51] <cbj4074> Absent the ability to e.g. hover-over the link and see where it actually points, doesn't that seem a bit risky?
[2016-12-14 21:22:19] <cbj4074> (thank you for responding so quickly, by the way!)
[2016-12-14 21:24:36] <MadLittleMods> cbj4074: Could be. Browser link peek, SSL certs, and the address bar help the situation. It's not something I am worried about but trying to think of the genuine situations it would hurt if changed
[2016-12-14 21:27:28] <cbj4074> Thanks,@MadLittleMods. I'm not worried about the certificate of the target site. My browser will warn me about that if/when I click on the link, should it happen to be questionable. All I care about is the link-peek.
[2016-12-14 21:28:36] <cbj4074> It actually strikes me as a fairly serious concern. What's to stop bad actors from posting links dressed-up as links to GitHub repos or something equally innocuous-seeming? We all know that all it takes to be compromised these days is clicking on a malicious link of a certain variety.
[2016-12-14 21:29:21] <cbj4074> It also makes me wonder about content that is parsed and displayed automatically in the client.
[2016-12-14 21:29:30] <cbj4074> Maybe there are safeguards to prevent abuse of that functionality  (e.g., arbitrary JS execution).
[2016-12-14 21:31:37] <MadLittleMods> @cbj4074 Codepens used to run right away but that changed a while back when Codepen introduced it.The Ethereum community suffers from bad actors linking to malware. But they aren't linking URL's from what I have seen and we now allow admins to clean up messages.
[2016-12-14 21:33:19] <satdav> I am on 3.0.3 is that the latest Windows build still for desktop
[2016-12-14 21:33:48] <MadLittleMods> satdav: 3.1.0 is the latest, [<-LINK->] 
[2016-12-14 21:34:44] <satdav> Why has mine not asked me to update
[2016-12-14 21:36:00] <satdav> MadLittleMods: Is that a known issue
[2016-12-14 21:37:30] <MadLittleMods> We haven't had other reports of users not getting the update but perhaps would go unnoticed by them. It should ping you every 24 hours. You can turn on logging and see what is happening [<-LINK->] 
[2016-12-14 21:37:49] <satdav> I have logging on
[2016-12-14 21:37:55] <satdav> if its the devolper log
[2016-12-14 21:38:41] <cbj4074> For what it's worth, none of my Win 7 machines ever prompted me to download v3.1.0,@satdav. I had to download it manually (although, I was prompted for previous updates). Not sure if it's the same issue you're having or not.
[2016-12-14 21:39:37] <cbj4074> If time wasn't such a luxury, I'd have bothered to report it. :/
[2016-12-14 21:39:41] <satdav> cbj4074: Yes I am on windows 10 but
[2016-12-14 21:39:56] <cbj4074> Same for my Windows 10 machines; sorry, should have been clear about that.
[2016-12-14 21:40:41] <cbj4074> MadLittleMods: Regarding the malicious link issue, I think it makes a lot of sense to add URL-peeking. Will a feature request to that effect be entertained if I file it?
[2016-12-14 21:41:49] <MadLittleMods> cbj4074: Probably not. I would be more after forcing a linked URL, to be the URL text
[2016-12-14 21:45:06] <satdav> Is their many changes to the updated version
[2016-12-14 21:45:09] <satdav> or just the one listed
[2016-12-14 21:45:32] <MadLittleMods> The manifest file that the updater checks is showing 3.1.0, http://update.gitter.im/win/package.jsonAuto-update logic wasn't changed from what I can see. Changes from v3.0.3 -> v3.1.0@satdav Open SawBuck, capture some logs that includes a update check and share it with me in a one to one
[2016-12-14 21:46:30] <satdav> I am going to update it the now
[2016-12-14 21:46:40] <MadLittleMods> satdav: Capture some logs before updating please
[2016-12-14 21:48:59] <satdav> Cool
[2016-12-14 21:49:28] <satdav> why does it open Edge rather than firefrox
[2016-12-14 21:50:55] <MadLittleMods> satdav: SawBuck? Links in the Gitter desktop app? You probably need to update default programs/apps in Windows
[2016-12-14 22:03:56] <satdav> I have it now just downloading it
[2016-12-14 23:14:24] <satdav> thats me updated its now seen it had a update needed
[2016-12-14 23:14:47] <satdav> Its looking a lot better the UI at the side
[2016-12-15 01:49:31] <selfagency> My Github repo moved to a new owner but Gitter is still pointing to issues and whatnot at the old URL. Is there a way to update this without having to create a new Gitter from scratch?

[2016-12-15 18:06:03] <MadLittleMods> selfagency: Send a message tosupport@gitter.imwith the URL of the old and new GitHub repo along with the URL of the Gitter room. Make sure the new owner already has a community on Gitter we can move it to
[2016-12-15 18:23:51] <selfagency> MadLittleMods: done
[2016-12-15 23:18:32] <dragon788> pasting a multi file Gist seems to greatly uglify the Gist preview functionality

[2016-12-16 02:58:57] <dragon788> Yeah, in IRC you just receive the messages from gitter so you see the pre edit and edited texts
[2016-12-16 02:59:16] <dragon788> And I think replies are pretty much immediate the same way
[2016-12-16 05:23:58] <grahamperrin> you can only edit 1 message backI have not noticed that restriction.
[2016-12-16 13:12:50] <dragon788> grahamperrin: when using the s/word/fix/ syntax
[2016-12-16 13:13:08] <dragon788> Otherwise it's a 5 minute window
[2016-12-16 13:17:59] <felixfbecker> Has anyone had the issue of all fonts being italic?
[2016-12-16 13:18:04] <felixfbecker> Using Edge
[2016-12-16 13:18:11] <felixfbecker> It only happens on one of my machine
[2016-12-16 13:18:22] <felixfbecker> Clearing cache, signing out etc nothing helped
[2016-12-16 13:19:19] <dragon788> Sounds like a font/style override in your browser, all sites or just one?
[2016-12-16 13:20:05] <felixfbecker> Only Gitter
[2016-12-16 13:20:29] <felixfbecker>  [<-LINK->] 
[2016-12-16 13:20:54] <felixfbecker> And it started totally out of nowhere
[2016-12-16 13:20:59] <felixfbecker>  [<-ISSUE->] 
[2016-12-16 13:25:20] <mydigitalself> that it only happens on one computer and we've heard no other reports of it, would lead me to believe it's something specific with your setup
[2016-12-16 13:26:57] <mydigitalself> does Edge have multiple profiles and does it happen on the same machine in another browser <--- that would actually be interesting, i have a theory
[2016-12-16 13:28:04] <mydigitalself> which is, we use Source Sans font, but we also look for a local version of it before going out to the web for a web font. andmaybeyou have a corrupt local version of source sans on your machine where the regular style is somehow italic
[2016-12-16 13:28:15] <mydigitalself> can you check your installed fonts?
[2016-12-16 13:29:15] <mydigitalself> you can also try inspect and go down to.fonts-loaded bodyclass and removeSourceSansLocal
[2016-12-16 13:37:50] <mydigitalself> felixfbecker: 
[2016-12-16 13:57:40] <felixfbecker> let me check
[2016-12-16 13:58:19] <felixfbecker> it works fine in Chrome
[2016-12-16 13:58:35] <felixfbecker> I heard some other user had the same problem
[2016-12-16 13:59:22] <felixfbecker> Removing SourceSansLocal does not solve it
[2016-12-16 13:59:51] <cbj4074> What is the "calculated" CSS that is being applied to the text?
[2016-12-16 13:59:53] <mydigitalself> try removing any of the other ones one at a time from left to right
[2016-12-16 13:59:55] <felixfbecker> removing source-sans-pro fixes it
[2016-12-16 14:00:20] <felixfbecker> So now it isfont-family: Source Sans Pro,-apple-system,Roboto,pt sans,calibri,sans-serif;
[2016-12-16 14:00:41] <felixfbecker> But the font looks different now than in Chrome
[2016-12-16 14:01:31] <mydigitalself> source-sans-prois the web font - so somehow your browser is displaying/loading italic in place of regular
[2016-12-16 14:02:21] <felixfbecker> Okay, so I went to fontsquirrel and installed Source Code Pro
[2016-12-16 14:02:37] <felixfbecker> Now only the chat box is italic, the chat and chat rooms not anymore
[2016-12-16 14:04:23] <felixfbecker> I don't see any network requests for the font
[2016-12-16 14:05:54] <mydigitalself> i can see why, the intput text area for some reason doesn't have the local fall-back font
[2016-12-16 14:06:20] <felixfbecker> But still, there is an issue when the user does not have the font downloaded
[2016-12-16 14:12:56] <mydigitalself> i still don't understand why Edge is displaying italics - doesn't happen on your other machine, same OS/Edge versions?
[2016-12-16 18:13:11] <felixfbecker> hm actually my other machine is on stable, while this one is on Insiders. But I don't think that is the problem, because it appeared out of nowhere and I was on Insiders before already
[2016-12-16 18:21:42] <cbj4074> Just eavesdropping here... I wouldn't necessarily assume that Microsoft isn't modifying the OS without your explicit knowledge or consent.
[2016-12-16 18:21:49] <cbj4074> So "out of nowhere" may not apply here.
[2016-12-16 22:44:54] <dragon788> is there a reason the gist preview box doesn't get scrollbars when embedded vs how GitHub's own embed URLs work eg on a blog?
[2016-12-17 01:41:41] <pdurbin> Is it a bug or a feature that it looks to people that I read at Gitter messages immediately because I use irc.gitter.im? This came to my attention at [<-LINK->] 
[2016-12-17 01:43:14] <pdurbin> all*
[2016-12-17 01:59:47] <dragon788> "feature" I think, as you also get to read people's messages instantly and when they make edits it sends a new message to your client rather than "fixing" the old one, so you can see everybody's dirty minds :D
[2016-12-17 08:41:53] <srimanipandey> hey there campers..... i think there is a bug blocking my progress. I am stuck on the 'Create a Set of Radio Buttons' where I've worte the following code:<input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required><lable>     <input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor</lable><lable><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Outdoor</lable><button type="submit">Submit</button></form>Please help.
[2016-12-17 11:02:50] <mydigitalself> srimanipandey: wrong room
[2016-12-17 11:03:41] <mydigitalself> pdurbin: we have one of two choices, either never mark them as read, or mark them as read if your IRC client receives them as IRC clients don't support the notion. we chose to do the former.
[2016-12-17 11:31:11] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] suggests four, not three, ` characters for blocks of code. Is that a typo?
[2016-12-17 11:51:07] <mydigitalself> grahamperrin: yip - thanks. corrected.
[2016-12-17 12:19:16] <grahamperrin> Thanks. I deleted my comment there.
[2016-12-17 12:19:49] <grahamperrin> For reference, but not worth making an issue of at this time (QupZilla here is not the most recent version):
[2016-12-17 12:21:22] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] 
[2016-12-17 12:22:49] <grahamperrin> After the event I browsed back and realised that whilst double-clicking to select text within a title, I had inadvertently clicked a 'CREATE TOPIC' button:
[2016-12-17 12:23:01] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] 
[2016-12-17 13:47:49] <mydigitalself> that doesn't look normal at all, does it look like that in other browsers?
[2016-12-17 13:48:01] <mydigitalself> like FireFox?
[2016-12-17 14:15:21] <grahamperrin> Not reproducible with Firefox. With regard to QupZilla, see the postscript to [<-ISSUE->] 
[2016-12-17 14:32:50] <grahamperrin> Appearances are very unpredictable, worse, in [<-LINK->] 4.14.10 but (again) that's probably an outdated version.
[2016-12-17 14:33:25] <grahamperrin> I don't use Konqueror (I launched it out of curiosity), I do sometimes use QupZilla.
[2016-12-17 15:32:23] <pdurbin> mydigitalself: is this feature of being able to tell whether or not someone read a message documented somewhere? I don't think Slack has this feature.
[2016-12-17 17:21:00] <mydigitalself> nope it's not really documented, it's just always existed
[2016-12-17 17:24:48] <pdurbin> Interesting. Do any other chat systems have this feature?
[2016-12-17 17:25:41] <mydigitalself> not that i'm aware of. well, whatsapp and some consumer stuff i suppose.
[2016-12-17 17:27:01] <pdurbin> Ok, thanks. It's an interesting feature. Of course, there's no telling if the person actually read and understood the message. :)
[2016-12-17 17:31:14] <pdurbin> This is interesting: "To opt out of the Read Receipts feature, go to Settings > Account > Privacy and uncheck Read Receipts." [<-LINK->] 
[2016-12-17 17:31:35] <pdurbin> Does Gitter allow you to opt out of read receipts? Or whatever Gitter calls them.
[2016-12-17 20:41:24] <mydigitalself> nope
[2016-12-17 21:39:46] <pdurbin> Are they called read receipts?
[2016-12-17 21:41:18] <edmundnoble> Read receipt is the kind of feature that makes me not want to use gitter. It encourages antisocial tendencies and violates my privacy.
[2016-12-17 21:41:36] <edmundnoble> The first one is more arguable.
[2016-12-18 09:00:56] <TetianaKhomko> Hi,  guys!  Please,  help me to know how i could add cufon in my project..  Maybe someone can share with me different tutorials or links to educational materials with this topic?
[2016-12-18 10:59:55] <grahamperrin> Is the project Gitter-related?  If it's not a Gitter support question, please ask elsewhere. Thanks.
[2016-12-18 13:10:37] <pdurbin> There's a "community" link at [<-LINK->] 
[2016-12-18 17:45:31] <kruhmet> srimanipandey: you wrote LABLE instead of LABEL
[2016-12-18 22:24:37] <lolmaus> I just accidentally deleted a huge message I wanted to edit. Why the hell Gitter neither asks for confirmation nor offers cancellation?!
[2016-12-18 22:54:49] <grahamperrin> Would it help if the system could recognise an edited post of, say, five characters or less as an accident?
[2016-12-18 23:25:24] <dragon788> Most browsers support ctrl+z in a text area to undo the last typing, click edit again and try to ctrl+z a few times?

[2016-12-19 12:26:24] <pdurbin> Did you open a GitHub issue back then?

[2016-12-19 15:46:59] <pdurbin> Ah, an old issue. Thanks for linking to it.
[2016-12-19 16:20:18] <ds84182> On Android the paste popup dismisses immediately after popping up, making it impossible to paste anything on Android
[2016-12-19 16:20:38] <ds84182> Or at least was... Now it works properly
[2016-12-19 16:21:25] <ds84182> Also sometimes pressing the enter button on the keyboard puts a newline in the input box instead of submitting
[2016-12-19 16:45:15] <dragon788> lolmaus: ouch, yeah a nuke button without confirmation is bad, having  a button is a slightly better workflow than "Edit, select all text then delete, then Enter", but instant nuke is bad
[2016-12-20 22:41:15] <TheBeege> hey folks. we're considering moving our org from slack to gitter, and i have a deep personal need... is it possible to add custom emoticons? i haven't seen anything about it in FAQs or the support site. i desperately need my dancing party parrot xD additionally, can anyone recommend an equally silly emote?
[2016-12-20 22:52:48] <vito-c> love the new dark theme
[2016-12-20 22:52:57] <vito-c> does GH have a dark theme too??
[2016-12-20 22:52:58] <vito-c> :D
[2016-12-20 23:48:31] <mydigitalself> TheBeege: nope, i'm afraid we don't support custom emoticons
[2016-12-20 23:48:36] <mydigitalself> yet
[2016-12-20 23:48:52] <TheBeege> mydigitalself: damn. alright, no worries. thanks for the prompt answer!
[2016-12-21 00:16:56] <grahamperrin> TryShift-Control-U 1F489with SHIFT LOCK engaged before the 1F489. Those Unicode folks have a weird sense of humour.@TheBeegeyou might find just one silly but non-dancing Unicode character and then people can copy and paste.

[2016-12-21 06:51:49] <JoshWeb27887257_twitter> what is the difference between BSD and Linux?
[2016-12-21 06:52:46] <JoshWeb27887257_twitter> I'm just starting out on my adventure in the CPU world and want to eventually get to do some coding!
[2016-12-21 06:54:08] <JoshWeb27887257_twitter> I've played with the GUI for quite some time but just recently taught myself the C L I for windows

[2016-12-21 06:56:56] <JoshWeb27887257_twitter> Is gitter based off of the git filing system and repository or am I in the wrong place.
[2016-12-21 06:58:08] <JoshWeb27887257_twitter> OK I get your meaning. See you there

[2016-12-21 07:33:46] <grahamperrin> Following that link to [<-LINK->] resulted in error 404, worked around by manually editing the URL to [<-LINK->] then I browsed back to [<-LINK->] to the 404 and (Firefox in FreeBSD-based TrueOS Desktop) Control-F5 a reload without cached content worked around the problem at the page with the trailing/in its URL.

[2016-12-21 07:44:23] <JoshWeb27887257_twitter> thank you@jaypatelani
[2016-12-21 07:48:03] <JoshWeb27887257_twitter> grahamperrin: what  os do you run?
[2016-12-21 07:53:04] <ghost~5826a72ed73408ce4f354d4f> grahamperrin: ohh dont know why that happened? its working fine here on Firefox OpenBSD
[2016-12-21 07:57:12] <grahamperrin> jaypatelani:  [<-LINK->] and (for a variety of purposes) I just posted a couple of screenshots to [<-LINK->] 
[2016-12-21 07:58:50] <grahamperrin> I reproduced the problem with a much cleaner profile for Firefox:
[2016-12-21 07:59:18] <ghost~5826a72ed73408ce4f354d4f> oh got it ..
[2016-12-21 08:00:17] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] 
[2016-12-21 08:01:38] <grahamperrin> In that incident – a first ever visit to an organisational URL – the error 404 was worked around by a simple reload; it was not necessary to use Control-F5.
[2016-12-21 08:04:29] <ghost~5826a72ed73408ce4f354d4f> hmm .,,
[2016-12-21 08:05:23] <grahamperrin> Another problem (maybe already a known issue): at [<-LINK->] a click on the star icon does not appear to favour the area.
[2016-12-21 08:09:19] <JoshWeb27887257_twitter> i think that might have to do with the error page that you on... could be wrong though
[2016-12-21 08:12:54] <JoshWeb27887257_twitter> when i click the star on the error page it would not allow it, i tried it on this page and another and it worked

[2016-12-21 08:14:01] <ghost~5826a72ed73408ce4f354d4f> well it is working for me though
[2016-12-21 08:18:40] <grahamperrin> Ah, thanks. So you can reproduce (but not explain) the error 404 for content that truly does exist?
[2016-12-21 08:19:24] <grahamperrin> For convenience, apologies for the roughness of the screen recording, here's the first frame that shows the 404:

[2016-12-21 13:04:21] <zhaizhiqiang1_twitter> begin
[2016-12-21 18:06:22] <polyvertex> Hi there, I'm a room admin ( [<-LINK->] ) and I have a problem with a user I banned after I warned him nicely because he was behaving incorrectly. He was offensive against an other user and myself, and even managed to write things like "fuhrer" for example (i.e. "my" room is dedicated to User Support for an application that runs for Windows). My problem is that he obviously cannot accept that ban and things are getting emotional on his side since he keeps creating accounts to be able to comment more. So now I took the decision of purely deleting his non-sense comments and I keep banning his new accounts (everything I do have been preceded by warnings for the sake of clarity). So I have warned him during the discussion we had before I ban him, I then left him a chance to amend his behavior but eventually had to ban him again as he wouldn't stop. For the sake of being transparent to the other users in the room, I even clearly wrote I was banning him so anyone could jump in in case they find my decision too harsh (this room is quite small anyway).My question is, is there a tool available to the admin for this kind of situation?He obviously keeps coming back and I don't want that newcomers be afraid to ask simple technical question just because they read offensive/negative words at their arrival on the room.What can I do?
[2016-12-21 18:16:49] <polyvertex> (I've just deleted another comment from him btw)
[2016-12-21 18:18:16] <MadLittleMods> polyvertex: Send me a message with their current username and don't ban them. I can take care of it
[2016-12-21 18:50:59] <polyvertex> MadLittleMods: I still have his initial username (the one I banned first), is it of any use to you?
[2016-12-21 18:52:01] <MadLittleMods> polyvertex: not really, provide the usernames still being trouble in a one to one with me
[2016-12-21 18:53:47] <polyvertex> MadLittleMods: I will if he comes back. Hopefully I won't need to do that. Thanks.
[2016-12-22 05:51:02] <begriffs> Just received an unsolicited 1-1 conversation spam from a user called "crosofg" with a video promoting swag from a company called flowxo. I will block the user but wanted to report the spam.

[2016-12-22 19:11:40] <grahamperrin> cbj4074: thanks, paste does not have the required effect when the copy is from within e.g. Eye of MATE Image Viewer, I see now that it works when copied from e.g. GIMP.
[2016-12-22 19:12:26] <MadLittleMods> grahamperrin: Depends on how the OS and your browser interprets things. Not very standard
[2016-12-22 19:13:51] <cbj4074> grahamperrin: Sure, no prob... sounds like it can be finnicky!

[2016-12-24 15:32:31] <MartinDelille> Hi! I created a room for my project and added github integration. I see github activity in the activity pane but I don't get notified. Is it possible to activate notification for activities?
[2016-12-24 18:30:05] <dragon788> More than watching the repository on GitHub to get emails?
[2016-12-24 19:39:32] <toxik-io> Well, you can reference things and they appear on gitter, supposedly.
[2016-12-24 20:48:19] <dragon788> You can reference an issue or pull request and it will resolve to a link, but new commits and issues only show up in the sidebar
[2016-12-25 14:18:00] <KalitaAlexey> How could I add badge to my repo?

[2016-12-26 07:40:27] <MartinDelille> With other chat system like irc or slack, commits push are posted in the main flow and trigger notification which make it convenient follow closely a project (not to spammy in small team)

[2016-12-28 03:33:29] <aoot> Hi Gitter HQ, I'm trying to figure out how to logout on the Gitter OSX client. So far I've tried to reinstall the program but the wrong account remains logged into client.
[2016-12-28 03:47:14] <grahamperrin> aoot: maybe not the best first answer (I rarely touch Mac OS X these days), is there application support data? Traditionally somewhere under~/Library/Application Support/
[2016-12-28 03:52:40] <aoot> grahamperrin: yeah there is, should I go ahead and delete the Gitter folder?
[2016-12-28 03:54:13] <aoot> I've quit the client, deleted the support folder, yet the account remains logged in
[2016-12-28 03:55:22] <grahamperrin> aoot: OK is the logged in account the same as (and/or at the same computer as) the account with which you're now chatting?
[2016-12-28 03:55:39] <grahamperrin> (I guess that you're using a web browser for this chat.)
[2016-12-28 03:56:38] <aoot> No, they are two different accounts. I'm trying to logout of the client and re-log into it with this account I'm chatting with (through the browser)
[2016-12-28 03:58:28] <grahamperrin> OK, my next wild guesses involve whether additional application support data is containerised; whether preferences exist separate from application support data, and whether those are containerised …
[2016-12-28 03:59:42] <aoot> Where else do OSX store preferences?
[2016-12-28 04:00:38] <grahamperrin> My zero knowledge of the GUI of the app can't help :-) are there login, logout or account options in the main menu bar, above the window of the app?
[2016-12-28 04:00:58] <grahamperrin> ~/Library/Preferences/
[2016-12-28 04:01:20] <grahamperrin> And in some cases for modern applications,
[2016-12-28 04:02:05] <aoot> Haha, it's alright! There is CML version of the app? Unfortunately there aren't any logout or account option in the menu bar, which just perplexes me...
[2016-12-28 04:02:26] <grahamperrin> ~/Library/Containers/and if you browse containerised data, proceed with caution.
[2016-12-28 04:04:51] <aoot> I found a plist under ~/Library/Preferences but it doesn't contain any account information; Tried deleting it and no vail
[2016-12-28 04:05:30] <aoot> It is no biggie, I use the web client mostly anyways, might figure it out alone the way
[2016-12-28 04:05:51] <aoot> grahamperrin: Thanks for all the suggestions though man!! :)

[2016-12-29 21:42:18] <weirdavid1_twitter> Quiet in here tonight
[2016-12-30 14:44:49] <hillct> Good morning all. What are the limitations of integration deployment within rooms? Seemingly anyone can add integrations to any room but I haven't seen any events show up in any room where I'm a member, or otherwise.
[2016-12-30 14:49:45] <hillct> Oh and while I'm thinking about it, both the android and iOS apps will blank out the content of a room (right pane empty, right header still visible). In such cases the only way to recover is to switch to another room and switch back, sometimes more than once to get the content to reappear.

[2017-01-03 20:01:21] <sils> Hey people, is the Gitter API rate limited? We've just fixed the gitter hubot adapter ( [<-ISSUE->] ) and during testing I hit the API rate limiting with our room of like 500 people. We seem to can only fetch 30 users at a time when starting the bot so that makes something like 20ish requests times a few tests. I couldn't find any docs about rate limiting. CC@MadLittleMods
[2017-01-03 20:02:13] <MadLittleMods> sils: Please refrain from pinging, anyone here can help you. The API is rate limited. 100/minute
[2017-01-03 20:03:35] <sils> Sorry, ok. 100/min sounds rather sensible though if we'd apply the bot for this room it wouldn't work anymore.

[2017-01-04 03:29:01] <seanmitch> I like OOP and encapsulation, but since I might want to penetration test when I'm older C might be better for that?
[2017-01-04 03:29:12] <seanmitch> Do you think I should learn c or c++?
[2017-01-04 03:29:29] <tommego> seanmitch: I prefer to c++
[2017-01-04 03:29:57] <seanmitch> Any reason why?
[2017-01-04 03:30:06] <tommego> And I dev app using c++

[2017-01-04 17:11:30] <ananyo2012> If it is image you can just drag and drop images
[2017-01-04 17:14:43] <DKurilo> MadLittleMods: , I asked about Gitter. My question is:How to make new line in Gitter mobile application?
[2017-01-04 17:37:19] <Project-Magenta> Can you update Gitter to show people online at top of list?
[2017-01-04 18:44:04] <cbj4074> Project-Magenta: It's been asked many times, and the short answer is that it's not a priority.
[2017-01-04 18:44:53] <cbj4074> There's an open issue about it (can't find it upon cursory search, unfortunately)
[2017-01-04 20:21:25] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @ankush981You can drag and drop and file onto the chat area to upload it
[2017-01-04 20:21:46] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @DKuriloYou can't, there is only chat mode on mobile.

[2017-01-05 13:44:52] <cbj4074> theromie: "Doesn't have any data" doesn't necessarily mean that it will evaluate to non-true. Is$upcomingBookingsa collection? An array?
[2017-01-05 13:58:38] <cbj4074> I just typed a message in the room laravel/laravel and now I see it here. Does anyone else see it (it precedes this one immediately)?
[2017-01-05 13:59:16] <cbj4074> The chat input field and display of the latest message or two has been buggy as hell for a while now, FWIW.
[2017-01-05 14:01:56] <cbj4074> I quit Gitter completely and I still see the message here, so, somehow, it appears to have been sent to the wrong room. Presumably, this is related to the occasionally-observed behavior whereby I switch from chat A to chat B, and I see messages from chat A in chat B.
[2017-01-05 14:02:13] <cbj4074> (although, this is the first time it has happened on the input side)
[2017-01-05 17:13:17] <Vishalthokade> Hello again, can anyone tell me how to create a new repository And how to let the repository host the actual website to the actual world for that I know that I have to go onto the settings of github and then I have to click on the launch automatic page generator but this is where I have stuck. I couldn't find this option in the settings menu. I am using windows 8.1
[2017-01-05 17:14:01] <grahamperrin> Vishalthokade: does the question relate to Gitter, or GitHub?
[2017-01-05 17:22:22] <Vishalthokade> Yeah of course I am working on github
[2017-01-05 17:26:25] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-01-05 17:37:30] <Vishalthokade> How to publish website on github? tell me somebody please
[2017-01-05 17:38:23] <grahamperrin> Vishal, Gitter is not GitHub. Please take questions about GitHub to a different room, thank you.
[2017-01-05 17:39:12] <Vishalthokade> But then where will I get answers regarding github
[2017-01-05 17:39:25] <Vishalthokade> I am new to the community please guide me
[2017-01-05 17:41:46] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] at the foot of the page there'sHelp. I would start there.
[2017-01-05 17:43:04] <grahamperrin> Certainly this room is not for help with GitHub. To complement the help paths that are offered by GitHub, you might search one of the rooms or topics listed at [<-LINK->] 
[2017-01-05 18:27:27] <DataSquid_twitter> Hi.  Just signed up.  Logged in using the Twitter integration.  I'm looking for a way to change my username etc. Is that possible or will I need to sign up a native account to have that set as I'd like?
[2017-01-05 18:48:11] <cbj4074> DataSquid_twitter: Definitely seen that question asked before, and I'm almost certain that the name cannot be changed. I'd seek a more authoritative source, though (I'm just a regular user).
[2017-01-05 18:48:20] <cbj4074> Did you check the FAQ and such?
[2017-01-05 18:49:35] <DataSquid_twitter> cbj4074: Yes, searched a few things on the support site, and found some info that suggests Twitter accounts might be treated as second-class by some channels, which in itself might be reason enough to not use it, but the info was 3 years old so I wasn't too confident it's still accurate.
[2017-01-05 18:59:47] <cbj4074>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-01-05 19:00:03] <cbj4074> DataSquid_twitter: ^
[2017-01-05 19:02:31] <cbj4074> The way I interpret that is that the_twitterwill always be appended if you sign in with Twitter, but that you can change your Gitter username by changing your GitHub or Twitter username.
[2017-01-05 19:02:37] <cbj4074> So, yeah, it sounds like you'd need to sign-in with GitHub to have justDataSquidor whatever you prefer.
[2017-01-05 19:04:12] <DataSquid_twitter> Thanks!
[2017-01-05 19:12:27] <cbj4074> No prob. Hopefully I'm right! :P
[2017-01-05 19:33:34] <DataSquid> Yup, nothing appended to your username if logging in with GitHub.
[2017-01-05 19:36:01] <cbj4074> 
[2017-01-05 23:55:18] <dragon788> DKurilo: there is a workaround, if you type some text and move your cursor into the middle of the text and press the enter key it will give you a new line and not send a text, at least on Android
[2017-01-05 23:55:30] <dragon788> And only sometimes
[2017-01-06 02:14:16] <DKurilo> dragon788: , thanks. It's not very comfortable. :)
[2017-01-06 05:22:51] <mooshoe> how do i upload files
[2017-01-06 05:25:09] <mooshoe> can i do that?
[2017-01-06 05:55:04] <grahamperrin> MooShoe: drag and drop, if your environment supports that. If not: please subscribe to [<-ISSUE->] and add thumbs up where appropriate. Thanks.
[2017-01-06 05:56:16] <mooshoe> ok

[2017-01-06 16:22:39] <superherointj> GITTER!!! Thank you very much for the Dark Theme!! Much appreciated!
[2017-01-06 17:44:52] <zachwelch> howdy... just joined gitter today in order to work with the Plone community.  i got connected to the IRC bridge, and it works okay... however, my client is being queried (/who) once per minute, littering my logs with useless messages. Is that expected/normal?   Also, it would super nifty if that bridge could (optionally? bi-directionally?) convert '<nick>:' at the start of a line to '@<nick>', so as  to improve interoperability between the two conventions of addressing individuals in a room.
[2017-01-07 13:02:35] <tonimarquez84> Hi everyone! my "ACTIVITY" bar is not updatingmy "integrations" are correctly configured... any suggestions? thank you!
[2017-01-07 17:01:26] <goto1> hi all, tried reinstalling gitter to sing in with a new account, but i dont see the option to login and/or logout anywhere in the desktop app for mac os... is there a way to switch accounts?
[2017-01-07 21:31:03] <dskusuma> goto1: look at top right of your screen, click on the gitter’s icon. there’ll be drop down menu. there is a ‘sign out’ option. Is that what you are looking for?
[2017-01-07 21:33:45] <goto1> ahh! yes! I was going through the menu bar and the options available in the gitter's app but didn't think about looking for it there lol, thanks!@dskusuma
[2017-01-07 21:34:54] <dskusuma> you’re welcome :)@goto1
[2017-01-08 14:05:07] <satdav> Good morning
[2017-01-08 14:05:36] <satdav> is their a way to merge 2 glitter accounts this one and@dweiruk_twitterI believe it was
[2017-01-08 19:13:46] <puremourning> Hello everyone. Why does Gitter client have such a high energy impact on mac OS? It constantly reports as high energy impact and that it requires the discrete graphics chip on macbook pro
[2017-01-08 19:13:59] <puremourning> THis is while running in the gitter client and while running in safari.
[2017-01-08 19:14:11] <puremourning> running in Chrome does not appear to have that issue
[2017-01-08 19:14:42] <puremourning> I've also noticed a lot of spinning when posting messages with markdown on a very slow or flaky network/internet connection
[2017-01-08 19:15:06] <puremourning> is this some issue with gitter client itself or more likely a safari/webkit issue?
[2017-01-08 19:15:49] <puremourning>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-01-08 20:22:38] <mistermantas> I’m not educated on this topic, but could it be that the Gitter client is just an Electron wrapper?
[2017-01-08 20:23:01] <mistermantas> Because, if that’s the case, you’re running another instance of Chrome. But again, this is just speculation.
[2017-01-08 20:57:14] <zachwelch> Why doesn't the IRC gateway forward my own messages to me over IRC?  Kinda erodes my trust in the gateway, if it's being selectively "smart".  This is a bug in my  book.
[2017-01-08 20:57:54] <zachwelch> i.e. connect via IRC, connect via the web, type in the web, notice you don't see the messages in IRC.  expected behavior: to see those message in IRC
[2017-01-08 20:58:18] <zachwelch> if gitter wants to supplant IRC, it needs to provide better interoperability
[2017-01-08 21:07:24] <AABatteries> Hi there, I'm having issues connecting to Gitter using my IRC client of choice (Hexchat). Can you help me figure out why I keep getting disconnected from my channels? I've described my issues in a reddit post found here: [<-LINK->] 
[2017-01-08 21:13:37] <zachwelch> AABatteries: i noticed that the server was sending a /who query once a minute... perhaps your client is not responding, so the gateway disconnects you?
[2017-01-08 21:14:17] <zachwelch> zachwelch: things that a per-minute /who query is a bug too, but whatever...
[2017-01-08 21:14:50] <zachwelch> zachwelch: has yet to hear a response to issue that he has brought up here, so i'm kinda losing my interest in using this platform
[2017-01-08 21:15:15] <zachwelch> irc just works
[2017-01-08 21:15:26] <AABatteries> How can I make my client respond then?
[2017-01-08 21:15:42] <zachwelch> AABatteries: if it's not a settable option, then it's probably a code change
[2017-01-08 21:15:58] <zachwelch> AABatteries: i'm not familiar with that client, so i don't know what knobs you can turn
[2017-01-08 21:16:48] <AABatteries> I'm just baffled that the server identifies me properly (I think) but i still get disconnected in the channels
[2017-01-08 21:17:08] <AABatteries> by the way I'm seeing you messages in my irc client
[2017-01-08 21:17:12] <zachwelch> AABatteries: if it's not responding (which, again, is just a theory), then it probably is just disable (or returning information that the server doesn't like)
[2017-01-08 21:17:58] <zachwelch> AABatteries: thanks for that feedback. i'd be curious to hear if you can see them on IRC when you type messages into the webUI while connected via IRC
[2017-01-08 21:18:05] <AABatteries> but mixed in between the reconnection messages
[2017-01-08 21:18:21] <zachwelch> that would pretty much confirm my hypothesis that the behavior is by design
[2017-01-08 21:18:31] <AABatteries> but I cannot see my messages
[2017-01-08 21:18:36] <zachwelch> right...  bug
[2017-01-08 21:18:52] <zachwelch> zachwelch: wonders who is in charge around here
[2017-01-08 21:20:55] <AABatteries> I'll try to connect to gitter using Irssi now
[2017-01-08 21:21:05] <AABatteries> I'll report back if it works
[2017-01-09 13:45:07] <raphaelhovsepyan> hi

[2017-01-09 17:50:35] <tomav> Hi guys, I can see some GitHub users having their direct chat under /github-username and github projects under /github-username/github-project-slug but I'm unable to setup this... It's ok for my direct chat, but I can't setup projects (the are not under my username when I create the chat from github, and I can't add a "/" in their URL. Any idea?
[2017-01-09 21:11:27] <lisbetho> Hi! Curious if there are any communities in particular that show a good example of room organization
[2017-01-09 21:11:54] <lisbetho> Looking to set one up for my community and want to see a finished product
[2017-01-10 01:31:36] <pdurbin> Room organization? Like, a lot of rooms?
[2017-01-10 03:20:47] <InternetUnexplorer> Is [<-ISSUE->] going to be fixed at some point?I may be wrong, but it seems like an easy fix, and the issue has been open for over a month now.
[2017-01-10 16:31:37] <dragon788> lisbetho: some organizations use a "Lobby" room that is org specific, and then they have additional rooms for each repository, but you can also set up rooms around topics as well (see FreeCodeCamp for examples)
[2017-01-10 18:20:19] <texas2010> hello gitter support. I have a problem with send message often. when i send message in chat room. it keep delay then post it in chat room act like internet was disconnect. but my internet is fine.
[2017-01-10 18:31:13] <InternetUnexplorer> texas2010: That's normal. Your connection is just slightly unstable or your connection to the Gitter servers has high latency.
[2017-01-10 18:38:44] <texas2010> my internet dont have a problem.  it is more like gitter problem.
[2017-01-10 18:40:03] <texas2010> InternetUnexplorer: by the way, it is not normal. I got it often since last month ago.  it is not suppose to be that way.
[2017-01-10 19:38:58] <zachwelch> texas2010: "normal" != "bug free" :)
[2017-01-11 06:31:16] <amitguptagwl> It doesn't work on my site: [<-LINK->] Login issue
[2017-01-11 11:59:23] <ionutblt> Hello, Gitter!My name is Ionut (written with an "i")I checked the topics and this problem doesn't pertain to any of them.I tried to install the Gitter desktop messenger app.Upon scanning it on virus-total.com it came up with 2 VIRUS warnings. Even if it is a false positive, I'm not inclined to install it. Too bad because I checked the Chrome Task Manager & this webpage takes  158.000 of my RAM. I want to keep it open all the time but can't due to hungry RAM usage.
[2017-01-11 12:03:20] <ionutblt> (will leave the window open, however, if someone replies to this issue ↑ )
[2017-01-11 13:07:04] <anddam> hello, is there a "mark all as read" button someplace to mark all unread message in a conversation as read?
[2017-01-11 13:07:52] <ionutblt>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-01-11 13:07:59] <ionutblt> in the upper right corner
[2017-01-11 13:08:00] <ionutblt> you have this button
[2017-01-11 13:08:08] <ionutblt> select Notifications
[2017-01-11 13:08:33] <ionutblt> select the last option Mute: notify me .....
[2017-01-11 13:08:47] <anddam> how does that apply to my question?
[2017-01-11 13:08:56] <anddam> I mean I wasn't referring to notifications
[2017-01-11 13:09:06] <ionutblt> anddam: sorry, it doesn't ^_^ you're right
[2017-01-11 13:09:15] <ionutblt> (dunno)
[2017-01-11 13:09:25] <anddam> that's ok, me neither
[2017-01-11 13:09:39] <anddam> I searched the "help" conversation with no luck

[2017-01-11 18:49:58] <cbj4074> ionutblt: Can you provide a URL to the desktop app to which you are referring here?   [<-LINK->] 
[2017-01-11 18:50:19] <cbj4074> Also, which version of Chrome are you using, in reference to the second issue?
[2017-01-11 18:51:03] <InternetUnexplorer> cbj4074: I assume he means [<-LINK->] .
[2017-01-11 18:51:37] <cbj4074> Can you paste the link without obfuscating it?
[2017-01-11 18:51:50] <cbj4074> (one thing I have complained about before... it's dangerous)
[2017-01-11 18:51:54] <InternetUnexplorer> It's not obfuscated... [<-LINK->] 
[2017-01-11 18:52:02] <cbj4074> I'm using the Desktop client, so yes, it is
[2017-01-11 18:52:07] <InternetUnexplorer> Oh, I see :)
[2017-01-11 18:52:18] <cbj4074> I suppose I could open DevTools, but that seems like an unnecessary burden. :D
[2017-01-11 18:52:55] <cbj4074> (IMO, the Desktop client should provide for the same URL preview mouse-over behavior that the browser does)
[2017-01-11 18:53:23] <cbj4074> I'd like to see the specific binary to which he's referring.
[2017-01-11 18:54:05] <cbj4074> Also, he doesn't specify which OS he's using.
[2017-01-11 21:06:21] <ionutblt> cbj4074: sorry for the late response (been away for awhile) [<-LINK->] the dekstop app can be downloaded if you access gitter.im while being logged out (or via Google Incognito)
[2017-01-11 21:06:30] <ionutblt>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-01-11 21:06:53] <ionutblt> you need to scroll down to the bottom of the screen, press "Get Gitter for Windows"
[2017-01-11 21:10:33] <ionutblt> I pasted the link to the Virus Total report;usually a basic app such as this, I'm thinking, shouldn't spark an alert; it shouldn't run with any special privileges or dabble into system files, dlls... whatever; I'm assuming that's why it got the detection.....On the other hand, an utility like "Take Ownership" or something that integrates into Shell I'm expecting to raise an alert; but this? ↑ ↑ :/(I admit that I have limited knowledge of how Windows works, but I do know more than your average Joe)
[2017-01-11 21:11:40] <ionutblt> my version of Google Chrome is 55.0.2883.87  (64 bit ) - How is this relevant?(The scanned file was sent to virustotal, scanned online... )
[2017-01-11 21:21:03] <cbj4074> ionutblt: Great, thanks for the follow-up! I'm curious not because I doubt your findings in any capacity; to the contrary, I'd like to know if anything questionable is being done.
[2017-01-11 21:21:14] <cbj4074> Regarding your Chrome version, it has nothing to do with the VirusTotal report; I asked about that in relation to RAM consumption.
[2017-01-11 21:27:12] <ionutblt> Ah, sorry, I must be tired ^_^
[2017-01-11 21:27:31] <ionutblt> Ok, yes, the RAM is a bit high
[2017-01-11 21:28:59] <cbj4074> Specifically, I was curious if you were on 54 or 55, due to the sizable reductions introduced with 55, as described in [<-LINK->] 
[2017-01-11 21:30:06] <cbj4074> Given that you're on 55, there's nothing much to suggest. :D But I agree; it's fairly hungry.

[2017-01-12 07:41:59] <paramaggarwal_twitter> I am new here. I really like this approach of an app directed at community-building. However I feel that the homepage does not do a great job of communicating this. Also, it took me a while to figure out how easy to go into a room and try it out.
[2017-01-12 07:44:27] <qinxiaowen> somebody at?

[2017-01-12 12:04:15] <bzouzou> hey all! I use to code with Sublim text, but i'm wondering if there's a better code editor?
[2017-01-12 12:04:18] <bzouzou> thx
[2017-01-12 12:27:57] <OFFLlNE> To make a suggestion about chat functionality, should I post it [<-LINK->] or maybe some could point to a place where I could post a suggestion. GitHub issues maybe?
[2017-01-12 14:00:26] <anddam> InternetUnexplorer: thanks
[2017-01-12 14:05:36] <cbj4074> OFFLlNE: Yep, feature requests go on GitHib issues. You can indicate that it's a feature request in the title, and the maintainers will tag it accordingly.
[2017-01-12 14:05:55] <cbj4074> bzouzou: Wrong place to ask :D Try Google.
[2017-01-12 14:11:06] <OFFLlNE> cbj4074: aight, thanks
[2017-01-12 14:13:56] <cbj4074> (sure thing... just trying to keep the chatter down so it's easier to get support for Gitter here; you might check out the Atom editor, by the way ;))
[2017-01-12 14:26:35] <bzouzou> Thx
[2017-01-12 14:52:01] <cbj4074> bzouzou: And thank you!
[2017-01-12 17:39:49] <Eurosom_twitter> HI All, I want to build small charity Fintech using secure solution integrated with local bank to transfer money. Can this solution be helpful? What do I need to do? Is the an examples or demos I can look to take an idea?
[2017-01-12 18:53:36] <cbj4074> Eurosom_twitter: This is a support channel... how'd you end-up here with a question like that? :P
[2017-01-12 18:53:50] <cbj4074> And by support, I mean technical support for the Gitter client.
[2017-01-13 03:12:52] <InternetUnexplorer> @Eurosom_twitter This is a support channel... how'd you end-up here with a question like that? :P@cbj4074 It honestly astounds me. Some poor guy shows up yelling at everyone about how he can't complete the tutorial, someone asks if anyone wants to join their project but yells at others for asking questions about it, someone is confused about how long it will take them to get a job offer from Gitter, someone thinks Gitter is a programming language, etc...(keep in mind this is from gitterHQ/developers, but still...)
[2017-01-13 04:12:33] <JordanB-1337> JordanB-1337: has noticed that /me messages don't get marked as read.
[2017-01-13 04:12:44] <JordanB-1337> JordanB-1337: will create an issue on github.
[2017-01-13 04:13:36] <JordanB-1337> JordanB-1337: is going to leave the chatroom. DM me if you need something.

[2017-01-13 07:05:15] <grahamperrin> Is the grey area a scroll bar without a scroller?
[2017-01-13 07:06:25] <grahamperrin> (The basic help for [<-LINK->] does not answer those questions.)
[2017-01-13 07:16:32] <grahamperrin> Re [<-LINK->] is it simply an area for favourites? If so:favouritism should be simple, not a dark art
I can't make GitterHQ a favourite.
[2017-01-14 01:30:42] <imbreannaa> Hi everyone . I'm new to this gutter chat and currently pursing my certification as a coder. First time and kind of nervous. Would love a mentor to help me get through this.
[2017-01-14 01:36:12] <cbj4074> imbreannaa: Welcome! The best course of action would be to find a Gitter room/community that is specific to the language you are seeking to learn (C++, C#, PHP, Python, Java, Ruby, whatever)
[2017-01-14 01:36:38] <cbj4074> (this room is for support relative to the actual Gitter chat client)
[2017-01-14 02:04:15] <InternetUnexplorer> (this room is for support relative to the actual Gitter chat client)@imbreannaa ^ what language(s) are you learning? I would find a specific room for that, and, when in doubt, there is always gitterHQ/developers, but it's kind of a wasteland of clueless people.
[2017-01-14 02:12:03] <imbreannaa> Thanks and I'm starting from square one. Learning the basics of HTML elements.
[2017-01-14 02:14:16] <pdurbin> good place to start
[2017-01-14 02:15:48] <pdurbin> You might like [<-LINK->] 
[2017-01-14 02:17:06] <InternetUnexplorer> pdurbin: Looks like a good site, though it seems that it is mainly for learning programming.
[2017-01-14 02:17:19] <InternetUnexplorer> (I did see HTML but it was way down on the list)
[2017-01-14 03:10:44] <mtancoigne> Hi !
[2017-01-14 03:11:47] <mtancoigne> (sorry for the pic, that wasn't meant to go here)
[2017-01-14 03:11:58] <mtancoigne> I really like gitter, and was thinking "what about a more compact theme ?"
[2017-01-14 03:12:16] <mtancoigne> the "chat" zone is ok, but a more compact "left" zone may be a good option
[2017-01-14 03:12:42] <mtancoigne> for touch device, the tall "contact" items in lists is great but on a computer, the more I have on screen, the better it is
[2017-01-14 03:14:42] <mtancoigne> What do you think about it ?
[2017-01-14 03:23:22] <mtancoigne>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-01-14 03:24:51] <mtancoigne> that was a quick "console hack" but I think space is important. Scrolling to find a room/person is really boring now :)
[2017-01-14 03:26:53] <mtancoigne> And with all this space, addingseparatorsorcategoriesmay be interesting
[2017-01-14 06:28:27] <grahamperrin> mtancoigne: thanks … maybe boring, but if scrolling will be desirable or required then a scroll bar and scroller should be visible. (If there's a bar in your shot, I can't see it.)
[2017-01-14 22:02:06] <glarsen> Question regarding third-party permissions with GitHub and Gitter. If I transition an organization from "no restrictions" to "restricting 3rd party access", will there be any unforeseen issues or outages? Is it as simple as approving Gitter once again? I’ve referred to [<-LINK->] but it only addresses the initial setup of Gitter community, not transitioning OAuth permissions.
[2017-01-14 22:06:32] <pdurbin> Huh, that article links to [<-LINK->] which I'm not sure I was aware of. I wrote about this stuff a bit at [<-LINK->] but I'm not sure about the answer to your question.
[2017-01-14 22:22:37] <glarsen> pdurbin: I enjoyed the blog post — it reflects my apprehension of hastily clicking the button! I’d like to put the protection in place but want to be sure I’m not going to adversely impact our private Gitter rooms, etc.
[2017-01-14 22:45:28] <pdurbin> Maybe I'm paranoid.
[2017-01-15 00:02:27] <mydigitalself> glarsen: yes, you will need to effectively follow the same instructions as that support article
[2017-01-15 00:27:15] <glarsen> mydigitalself: thank you for the confirmation. Made the switch and everything appears perfectly in order.
[2017-01-15 03:18:27] <erikrdgz> Hello I realize this is a gitter page but I could not find a github support chat. I am having trouble viewing a repository. I have made three successful repository uploads but my fourth keeps getting a 404 error message. It mentions the index.html file but I know its in the master branch.
[2017-01-15 03:52:17] <InternetUnexplorer> erikrdgz: Don't ask the same question in multiple rooms. You already asked in gitterHQ/developers.

[2017-01-15 14:52:02] <andyjefferson> hi, trying to use the android app login via Github, and it's stuck at Two-factor authentication, waiting to receive an SMS but nothing coming. Is this only usable on a phone (and not a tablet with no SIM) ?
[2017-01-15 14:52:30] <LeonWashbrook_twitter> grahamperrin: k
[2017-01-15 14:54:08] <andyjefferson> never mind, SMS arrived after a long wait!
[2017-01-15 15:26:48] <jorge-sanz> Hi! How can I delete a Community I created but now I am out of it? [<-LINK->] Can you delete it? I created it by error. Thank you!
[2017-01-16 18:30:50] <mtancoigne> grahamperrin: sorry for the long time... There's no scrollbar on the screenshot, that's true, I did it quickly. The idea was to reduce the items in the list to reduce the scrolling time to access the right contact and display more information in this panel.
[2017-01-16 18:31:58] <mtancoigne> If you think the idea may be interesting, I can work a bit more on it to create a prototype...
[2017-01-16 18:47:02] <grahamperrin> Thanks, don't work on for me alone. I'm just one of those people who uses scroll bars.
[2017-01-16 18:54:36] <InternetUnexplorer> Also, is there any update for this being fixed?It's a 3 line, at most, fix, which has been marked as 'ready' for over a month now. [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-01-16 19:19:27] <mtancoigne> grahamperrin: I'll remember it :) But for now, I need a little more feedback on this.
[2017-01-16 19:49:08] <Razva> folks, how can I create a new Room for my Community? at this point I have only the Lobby
[2017-01-16 19:50:04] <KalitaAlexey> Razva: ,Are you using web version of gitter?
[2017-01-16 19:50:13] <Razva> yup
[2017-01-16 19:50:22] <Razva> Razva: just discovered Gitter
[2017-01-16 19:50:22] <KalitaAlexey> There is a cloud in the top.
[2017-01-16 19:50:33] <Razva> yeah, that is for a new Community
[2017-01-16 19:50:45] <Razva> I've created a new Community, and the Lobby channel
[2017-01-16 19:50:58] <Razva> now...is there any way to create a new channel except lobby?
[2017-01-16 19:51:12] <KalitaAlexey> There is a cloud in the top.
[2017-01-16 19:51:14] <KalitaAlexey> Click on it.
[2017-01-16 19:51:26] <KalitaAlexey> And in the bottom there is "Add a room".
[2017-01-16 19:53:14] <Razva> I really, really cannot see/find it. and I promise you I'm not a retard! :D
[2017-01-16 19:53:33] <KalitaAlexey> What do you can't see?
[2017-01-16 19:53:33] <Razva> can you please make a screenshot or something?
[2017-01-16 19:55:40] <KalitaAlexey> Razva: ,What can't you see?
[2017-01-16 19:56:52] <Razva> KalitaAlexey: check this out please: [<-LINK->] 
[2017-01-16 19:57:34] <KalitaAlexey> In the left top there is a cloud under the gitter icon. Do you see it?
[2017-01-16 19:57:37] <Razva> Ireallycannot find any Add Room button, or plus or something like that. I can see only Add A Room, which will redirect me to a new Community
[2017-01-16 19:57:47] <Razva> yup, All Conversations
[2017-01-16 19:57:54] <KalitaAlexey> Click on it.
[2017-01-16 19:57:57] <Razva> done.
[2017-01-16 19:58:27] <KalitaAlexey> In the bottom of the opened panel there is a button "Add a room"
[2017-01-16 19:58:35] <Razva> yes
[2017-01-16 19:59:19] <KalitaAlexey> That's it.
[2017-01-16 19:59:29] <KalitaAlexey> Choose your community and create a new channel.
[2017-01-16 19:59:34] <Razva> oooooh ok
[2017-01-16 19:59:57] <Razva> hah it's a bug, really!
[2017-01-16 20:00:11] <KalitaAlexey> What is wrong?
[2017-01-16 20:00:19] <Razva> when I click on it for 1 second I can see a small popup asking me for the COmmunity
[2017-01-16 20:00:26] <Razva> and then I'm redirected to the new community page
[2017-01-16 20:01:31] <KalitaAlexey> I am using Edge, but I don't think it matters.
[2017-01-16 20:01:54] <Razva> just a sec, uploading a screencast
[2017-01-16 20:01:58] <KalitaAlexey> May you click on the "Create New Community" link.
[2017-01-16 20:02:10] <Razva> check it out: [<-LINK->] 
[2017-01-16 20:03:18] <KalitaAlexey> Give me a link to your community. I can create a room for you.
[2017-01-16 20:03:57] <Razva>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-01-16 20:04:07] <Razva> but it would be ideal for me to be able to create rooms :D
[2017-01-16 20:04:16] <KalitaAlexey> I can't open it.
[2017-01-16 20:04:31] <Razva> ok, can you delete it?
[2017-01-16 20:04:55] <Razva> I'll just try to delete it by myself
[2017-01-16 20:06:20] <Razva> oooh come ooon! I've deleted it and now, when trying to recreate, it states that the URL is already taken :|
[2017-01-16 20:06:20] <KalitaAlexey> Try another browser.
[2017-01-16 20:06:29] <Razva> tried Chrome and Safari
[2017-01-16 20:06:43] <Razva> can you please delete anything /cncted related?
[2017-01-16 20:07:11] <Razva> maybe it's because I've initially created the community with a twitter account...dunno...
[2017-01-16 20:07:56] <KalitaAlexey> Let's try another way.
[2017-01-16 20:08:01] <Razva> anyway, please delete /cncted so I can start over with this Git account, which hopefully will work :|
[2017-01-16 20:08:04] <KalitaAlexey> Do you see your profile in the right top?
[2017-01-16 20:08:08] <Razva> yup
[2017-01-16 20:08:17] <KalitaAlexey> Click on it and choose home.
[2017-01-16 20:08:36] <KalitaAlexey> And there should be a "Create" button.
[2017-01-16 20:09:09] <Razva> I'm redirected to the Create Community page
[2017-01-16 20:09:27] <KalitaAlexey> It's a shame. I can't help you.
[2017-01-16 20:10:09] <Razva> can you please delete the /cncted URL so I can regen it?
[2017-01-16 20:10:19] <Razva> because at this point I'm left with no URL and no room :)
[2017-01-16 20:12:37] <Razva> to see that I'm not crazy: [<-LINK->] 
[2017-01-16 20:12:51] <Razva> macOS, latest, Chrome and Safari. same error.
[2017-01-16 20:13:21] <KalitaAlexey> Razva: ,I can't. You need help from someone from gitter team.
[2017-01-16 20:13:35] <Razva> horray.
[2017-01-16 20:13:51] <Razva> anyway, thanks for your time! :)

[2017-01-18 02:30:24] <alexknvl> For some reason I can't create any rooms under my account name, e.g. "alexknvl/sio".
[2017-01-18 02:32:44] <alexknvl> A long time ago I accidentally removed Gitter Private integration on GitHub, gitter broke, I contacted the support, they did some magic and it started working again (as far as I remember), but I never added that integration back. Could it be because of that?
[2017-01-18 14:04:18] <cbj4074> Seems to be worth enabling...
[2017-01-18 15:50:43] <tomav> Hi guys, I can see some GitHub users having their direct chat under /github-username and github projects under /github-username/github-project-slug but I'm unable to setup this... It's ok for my direct chat, but I can't setup projects (the are not under my username when I create the chat from github, and I can't add a "/" in their URL. Any idea?
[2017-01-18 22:25:09] <martinium> How can I adjust the font size/zoom level on linux gitter desktop app?
[2017-01-18 23:21:12] <alexknvl> cbj4074: Yes, but how exactly do I do that? There is no way to do that through Github AFAIK. The button in the top right menu doesn't do anything for me.

[2017-01-23 09:38:11] <marcjan> Hi guys. I would like to ask where can I find any docs about how to turn on push email notifications in Gitlab 7.5.3?
[2017-01-23 10:18:41] <grahamperrin> Gitlab support. Here is Gitter, not Gitlab.
[2017-01-23 10:36:35] <marcjan> oh gosh sorry :)
[2017-01-23 12:12:37] <longtomjr> Good day. I am looking into using Gitter for a scheduled meeting for an open source project. I just want to know if there is a way to make the archives public but the channel not? (I know this is a pretty niche scenario, just want to know if there is a feature that I am missing)
[2017-01-23 12:13:45] <longtomjr> The channel can be public to view aswel, I just want the archives to be clean, so I can link to the day that the meeting happened, and the meeting is all that will be present in the chat.
[2017-01-23 12:43:52] <pdurbin> interesting use case
[2017-01-23 12:46:01] <longtomjr> yep :)
[2017-01-23 12:46:48] <longtomjr> Is it a bit far fetched to want to use Gitter for this?
[2017-01-23 12:47:43] <longtomjr> should I look into something else? I was thinking IRC at first, then just storing the logs somewhere in text.
[2017-01-23 12:49:45] <longtomjr> Is there a way to get the chat logs as text?
[2017-01-23 16:53:48] <pdurbin> People have asked about exporting chat history: [<-LINK->]

[2017-01-23 17:51:53] <LeonineKing1199> I tried looking at the docs and didn't see anything
[2017-01-23 17:52:02] <LeonineKing1199> I'd like to basically fill it with just some custom text
[2017-01-23 18:40:22] <kylbarnes> Hello. Is there any documentation on how to setup Github integration for posting a message to a room when a pull request is merged? I've looked around the support site, but could not find anything.
[2017-01-23 19:41:40] <LeonineKing1199> I think you'd need to use github hooks
[2017-01-23 19:41:46] <LeonineKing1199> I'm not sure about the capabilities they offer
[2017-01-23 19:42:02] <LeonineKing1199> But github integrations are just as simple as a curl request to the proper webhook url
[2017-01-23 19:42:13] <LeonineKing1199> I actually answered my own question as well :P

[2017-01-25 15:24:13] <polyvertex> Hi, is there some kind of alog out every current sessionfeature in gitter?
[2017-01-25 15:25:45] <polyvertex> It seems my account remained live for about a day now whereas I was properly logged out from every device
[2017-01-25 15:28:47] <InternetUnexplorer> On a different note, WHY is it the default behavior on Gitter for Android that as soon as the text field goes out of focus it posts whatever was in it? Who thought this was a good idea? So, if you're typing something and decide you want to tap the back button or edit a message, it posts whatever you have typed...
[2017-01-25 17:05:34] <fornwall> S
[2017-01-25 17:50:52] <zazazack> Surely this question has been asked before: How do I search a gitter "archives" to see if my question has already been asked before?
[2017-01-25 17:55:49] <InternetUnexplorer> You should click the room settings icon at the top right of the room and select archives.
[2017-01-25 18:00:11] <zazazack> InternetUnexplorer: I checked the room settings>archives link, but no search functionality. Do you have to manually click on each one of the little squares to see the discussion from that day?
[2017-01-25 18:05:27] <zazazack> Ah, I think I’ve found it, search for term/s == cmd+s (on mac) per [<-LINK->] 
[2017-01-26 12:26:29] <ochrons> gitter seems to experience some serious network issues
[2017-01-26 13:09:42] <sils> people in our community are reporting they can't switch channels anymore, it's super hard to chat with anyone
[2017-01-26 13:41:51] <mydigitalself> sils: having some infrastructure fails atm - should mostly be restored now, but running hot
[2017-01-26 13:42:53] <cbj4074> Was just about to say... couldn't switch channels there for a few minutes.
[2017-01-26 14:43:28] <justinclift> Has anyone noticed weirdness with the Activity pane on the right side of the OSX desktop client today?
[2017-01-26 14:43:48] <justinclift> For me, it's not loading properly with some rooms (eg sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser)
[2017-01-26 14:51:17] <mydigitalself> justinclift: it's related to some infrastructure issues we're having at the moment and has been turned off for subsequent page loads
[2017-01-26 17:44:26] <rgolea> Hi guys! I’m on my mac and gitter keeps opening in a Safari based application and not in my default Chrome browser. Is there a fix for this?
[2017-01-26 17:44:40] <rgolea> I find slow performances on Safari
[2017-01-26 18:03:10] <justinclift> mydigitalself: Thanks. :)
[2017-01-26 18:53:09] <mydigitalself> rgolea: you mean the gitter app itself being safari-based?
[2017-01-26 19:04:41] <Toxicable> Hey guys, is there any information somewhere on what kind of account we should use for a bot on here ?
[2017-01-26 22:19:15] <texas2010> mydigitalself: hello, we have a problem.  people keep get mention by a bot.people feel it is so annoying when bot do that... [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-01-26 22:33:32] <rom1504> so irc.gitter.im won't let me connect since this afternoon
[2017-01-26 22:33:36] <rom1504> it says I need to authenticate
[2017-01-26 22:33:56] <rom1504> except I changed nothing in my weechat config and it worked fine for a bunch of months
[2017-01-26 22:34:15] <rom1504> I think something went wrong in the last update
[2017-01-26 22:48:51] <InternetUnexplorer> rom1504: Sounds like it might be related to the infrastructure issues mentioned above?
[2017-01-26 22:50:15] <InternetUnexplorer> hello, we have a problem.  people keep get mention by a bot.people feel it is so annoying when bot do that... January 26, 2017 4:13 PM  January 26, 2017 4:15 PMIs that an issue with Gitter, or an issue with the bot itself, @texas2010?
[2017-01-26 22:50:54] <texas2010> are you gitter support?@InternetUnexplorer
[2017-01-26 23:07:46] <graingert> :(
[2017-01-26 23:07:56] <graingert> is itc.gitter down
[2017-01-26 23:07:56] <will> is there a way to prevent being notified from random rooms you're not in when people think that the will they're talking to is@willbut they're not I'm@will?
[2017-01-26 23:08:05] <graingert> is irc.gitter.im down?
[2017-01-26 23:08:08] <graingert> I'm getting
[2017-01-26 23:08:30] <graingert>  [<-LINK->]

[2017-01-27 00:05:05] <InternetUnexplorer> texas2010: No, I'm not affiliated with Gitter in any way, other than the fact that I use their services. I was just curious about your question, as it seemed like a problem with a bot, not a problem with Gitter itself.
[2017-01-27 00:08:41] <texas2010> InternetUnexplorer: , no. I report to gitter support about someone's bot is harassment people. because bot keep tag people.  that is why someone need to stop.
[2017-01-27 00:17:48] <InAnimaTe> graingert: i can connect but i have thiswholine played back at me
[2017-01-27 00:18:43] <InAnimaTe> also wanted to inquire on how irc is coming ;)
[2017-01-27 00:19:15] <InternetUnexplorer> Does Gitter have a status page, where we can see what services are having outages?
[2017-01-27 00:20:15] <InAnimaTe> ^didn't see one in googling
[2017-01-27 01:27:28] <InternetUnexplorer> InAnimaTe: That's what I thought... It's strange that a service such as Gitter doesn't have one.
[2017-01-27 03:00:02] <adoma_vera_twitter> hi peeps
[2017-01-27 03:01:46] <adoma_vera_twitter> mario can i have your picture
[2017-01-27 03:23:19] <47181770> 1
[2017-01-27 04:32:52] <InternetUnexplorer> adoma_vera_twitter: Not sure why you need to ask his permission to save an image from a webpage you are viewing...
[2017-01-27 04:32:58] <InternetUnexplorer> 47181770: 2
[2017-01-27 09:16:45] <rom1504> irc.gitter.im is still broken
[2017-01-27 09:16:54] <rom1504> now it's possible to connect but not to send messages
[2017-01-27 09:16:56] <rom1504> what's up ?
[2017-01-27 09:26:06] <mydigitalself> rom1504: related to issues last night, amazon is doing some Weird Stuff with load balancer routing at the moment
[2017-01-27 09:26:08] <mydigitalself> trying to resolve
[2017-01-27 10:17:15] <mydigitalself> InternetUnexplorer: nope, we just generally tweet things.
[2017-01-27 10:26:22] <Hommer12> hello
[2017-01-27 10:26:35] <Hommer12> can i get some feedback
[2017-01-27 10:26:47] <Hommer12> about how to improve my website design
[2017-01-27 10:27:47] <Hommer12> how to insert pic here
[2017-01-27 11:48:09] <hcaz> Hey everyone, I am a CompSci student and I use Gitter for a few different group projects at university.Recently I have stopped receiving notifications for any of the rooms I am part of, is this something other people are experiencing also?
[2017-01-27 14:39:09] <dragon788> hcaz: there were some infrastructure issues yesterday
[2017-01-27 14:39:45] <hcaz> dragon788: Ive been noticing this for about 2 weeks now but thought it might just be me
[2017-01-27 14:41:02] <dragon788> have you checked your room specific settings and they are all set to notify on any message or on mentions?
[2017-01-27 14:41:41] <hcaz> Yea I have made sure everything is set to "Notify me about everything"
[2017-01-27 14:41:48] <hcaz> I even tried disabling them and reanabling them
[2017-01-27 14:41:59] <dragon788> and you just aren't getting the green activity indicators on the channels?
[2017-01-27 14:43:26] <hcaz> Yes I am, however No push notifications / emails come through
[2017-01-27 15:34:31] <mydigitalself> push notifications should be just fine, but we have some ongoing issues with email notifications, yes
[2017-01-27 15:36:45] <InternetUnexplorer> OK, this is getting really annoying. Can itpleasenot be the default behavior on Android that when the text field loses focus it posts whatever is in it? If you were typing and decided to edit a message or close the room, your message will be posted with no warning. It's seriously frustrating.
[2017-01-27 16:07:20] <mydigitalself> it's a by-product of the way the android web view works, it's not intentional and it's something we'd like to fix in the future, but it will take putting in a native keyboard implementation instead of the webview approach we currently use.
[2017-01-27 16:08:48] <mydigitalself> you should also check this out:https://github.com/terrysahaidak/GitterMobilecommunity member who's been building his own React Native set of mobile apps for gitter
[2017-01-27 16:45:57] <hcaz> @dragon788 Thanks for your help!@mydigitalself Thanks for confirming :)
[2017-01-27 17:36:59] <InternetUnexplorer> mydigitalself: Thanks for your response, I will check it out.
[2017-01-27 19:46:10] <LeonWashbrook_twitter> anyone rage?
[2017-01-27 20:17:39] <YGR_Akrillo_twitter> Does anyone know if it's possible to create a Room using the API? We create a platform for some events that lasts a couple of weeks. For each event we want to create an channel automatically. I already read that the create action for channels is private but... does anyone know a workarround or a good alternative? Instead of implementing an own chat system we had the idea to just use gitter .
[2017-01-27 20:23:47] <mydigitalself> YGR_Akrillo_twitter: unfortunately there's not really an option for you at the moment, but it's something we'll look into in the future. may be best to create an issue for it at [<-LINK->] and if there's enough  's will prioritise
[2017-01-27 20:25:37] <Toxicable> Hey guys, are we meant to use just any account for a chatbot? I made a new one for it but I think it's been banned after a few hours of use
[2017-01-27 20:27:37] <YGR_Akrillo_twitter> Thank you for the quick response! I think this is just something that I won't care about in the futur because we need a solution in the next few months.So we have to use slack or mattermost or a similar service  . Anyways great tool I really like its evolution 
[2017-01-27 21:11:27] <texas2010> hello, gitter support.  Activity list is not working.. it seem it  is broken.
[2017-01-27 21:11:45] <texas2010> no new activity today...
[2017-01-27 21:45:20] <Lorin_twitter> How recent is this Gitter thing? When was it launched
[2017-01-27 21:46:40] <cbj4074> texas2010: I think it's a known issue.
[2017-01-27 21:52:33] <texas2010> cbj4074: thanks!
[2017-01-27 21:52:44] <texas2010> i just make sure they know about it.
[2017-01-27 21:54:14] <cbj4074> texas2010: No prob! Yeah, infrastructure issues have been acknowledged, so presumably they know.
[2017-01-27 21:55:32] <texas2010> yeah
[2017-01-27 23:26:34] <InternetUnexplorer> Lorin_twitter: Gitter's limited beta opened in late 2013 IIRC.
[2017-01-28 06:52:33] <sogko> Hey guys, I seem to have an issue with adding users to a room (public)
[2017-01-28 06:52:54] <sogko> I assume there should be a pop-up when I click 'Add users to this room', but nothing happens
[2017-01-28 06:52:58] <sogko> nothing on the console either
[2017-01-28 10:52:48] <miohtama> Is it possible to disable desktop notifications, unless mentioned, on ALL rooms?
[2017-01-28 10:53:12] <miohtama> I am on several Gitter rooms and it is super annoying to unnecessary desktop notifications
[2017-01-28 12:28:40] <schas002> Can't I create a GitHub integration with my room now? :/
[2017-01-28 12:29:48] <schas002> When trying to create a GitHub integration in a room I moderate, it transports me to the list of Gitter rooms made by [<-LINK->] .
[2017-01-28 12:30:38] <schas002> The very next visit to the integrations window, I see the webhook created, yet unaddressed.
[2017-01-28 12:31:21] <schas002> I experienced that on a GitHub organization-based community room.
[2017-01-28 12:32:25] <schas002> Okay, I try to create the integration on the other end of the to-be-but-still-not line.
[2017-01-28 12:32:56] <schas002> In the GitHub repository settings, Integrations > Add service > Gitter.
[2017-01-28 12:33:13] <schas002> It asks for a token, which I havenot.
[2017-01-28 12:33:48] <schas002> Because I'm unable to reach the "Configure manually" option due to the bug above.
[2017-01-28 12:34:19] <schas002> That's all I've got, and I failed to get a GitHub integration.
[2017-01-28 12:48:24] <RWOverdijk> Is anything broken? I can only reach gitter through incognitto. I didn't change anything, it just stopped working.
[2017-01-28 12:48:44] <RWOverdijk> It keeps waiting for cdn03.gitter.im, and crashing my tab
[2017-01-28 12:52:37] <schas002> Not a Gitter sysadmin, but CDN [<-ISSUE->]  [<-LINK->] .
[2017-01-28 12:53:53] <RWOverdijk>  [<-ISSUE->] ?
[2017-01-28 12:54:05] <RWOverdijk> Because it switches between 2 and 3
[2017-01-28 12:54:51] <schas002> CDN [<-ISSUE->]  [<-LINK->] .
[2017-01-28 12:56:01] <schas002> Now CDN [<-ISSUE->] is up.
[2017-01-28 16:15:39] <rgolea> mydigitalself: yes, the app itself is safari based.
[2017-01-28 16:15:47] <rgolea> can I switch?
[2017-01-28 17:20:54] <RWOverdijk> I really can't get gitter to work without using incognito
[2017-01-28 17:20:58] <RWOverdijk> No idea why.
[2017-01-28 17:21:05] <RWOverdijk> Cleared cache, did a hard restart
[2017-01-28 17:22:20] <RWOverdijk> Ah, when I switch from next to current it works
[2017-01-28 17:22:23] <RWOverdijk> So next is broken for me
[2017-01-28 18:29:34] <viluon>  [<-LINK->] 's a useful Gitter status page a friend of mine made
[2017-01-28 18:32:43] <viluon> Oh haha, he's changed it, nvm
[2017-01-28 18:47:11] <InternetUnexplorer> viluon: 
[2017-01-28 18:49:06] <schas002> RWOverdijk: Next works for me.
[2017-01-28 19:26:11] <RWOverdijk> schas002: Oh well, okay then..
[2017-01-28 19:27:00] <RWOverdijk> Then I must be wrong, and it's just working even though it appears not to. Thanks! :p
[2017-01-28 19:27:18] <RWOverdijk> Anyway I'm fine with not using next for now. This is working just fine :)
[2017-01-28 22:43:01] <ashmastaflash> schas002: I’m having the same problem trying to set up webhooks.  Did you get a resolution?
[2017-01-29 08:32:56] <shendengnian> hello
[2017-01-29 09:52:34] <schas002> ashmastaflash: Not yet...
[2017-01-29 10:24:12] <schas002> :/
[2017-01-29 11:40:21] <mydigitalself> rgolea: nope, unfortunately not. we have a chrome-based one coming - you can run it yourself: [<-LINK->] 
[2017-01-29 12:08:54] <rgolea> mydigitalself: ETA for that one? Gitter keeps loosing messages, whenever they’re pushed via sockets. The messages don’t show up when changing rooms/private messages, it doesn’t even know that I’ve changed rooms unless I click 20 times or restart gitter. It’s a great app but these setbacks make it really hard to use. BTW, even the phone app (iPhone 6 with latest iOS) goes way better than the desktop client app. Any ideas?
[2017-01-29 12:10:06] <hellobama> How to delete my repository created in gitter-badger?
[2017-01-29 12:12:00] <schas002> hellobama: Ask the persons behind gitter-badger to make him remove repositories after himself.
[2017-01-29 12:14:09] <hellobama> schas002: Okay, thanks for the reply.
[2017-01-29 12:14:45] <schas002> Badger doesn't delete repositories by himself.
[2017-01-29 12:40:45] <mydigitalself> hellobama: why do you want it deleted?
[2017-01-29 18:35:06] <JoshEngebretson> Hello, all of our integrations yield 404's when clicked on from the settings panel since the downtime this week, any known issues or fixes on this?
[2017-01-29 18:35:30] <JoshEngebretson>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-01-29 18:35:43] <JoshEngebretson> The feed has also stopped updating since that time
[2017-01-29 18:38:36] <JoshEngebretson> Looks like the activity feed on the right here stopped same day, probably not a coincidence I am thinking :)
[2017-01-29 22:00:45] <tyler-furby> tylerfurbyceo: Hello guys, I need some help…  Trying to install this: [<-LINK->] I get an error when doing npm run structorTypeError: callback is not a functionAnyone know where to begin on fixing this?
[2017-01-29 22:18:07] <hellobama> Hello@mydigitalself, This repo should be private, it was my mistake, can it be deleted? thank you.
[2017-01-30 02:00:08] <InternetUnexplorer> hellobama: This repo is certainly not a mistake, and it has >4000 people in it who would be somewhat inconvenienced were it to be deleted. Did you perhaps mean a different repo, that you meant to link to?
[2017-01-30 04:34:02] <tbaker4802> is something wrong with gitter? I can only get it to work if I enable the gitternext...
[2017-01-30 04:39:26] <MadLittleMods> tbaker4802: Thanks for the report :) - Can reproduce
[2017-01-30 04:40:39] <tbaker4802> no problem.  I thought it was the CDN, but when i enabled gitternext it worked.  glad it wasn't just me, thought i had lost it lol
[2017-01-30 04:55:08] <tbaker4802> just to let you know, if i disable next, it goes back to being broke.
[2017-01-30 08:33:23] <N8Solutions> My activity feed has stopped updating. Is anyone else experiencing this issue?
[2017-01-30 08:36:12] <schas002> N8Solutions: Yes.
[2017-01-30 08:36:42] <schas002> FreeCodeCamp room's activity feed is experiencing only bad news recently.
[2017-01-30 08:37:50] <N8Solutions> Just opened a ticket for it [<-ISSUE->] I'm working mostly in Gantry, Grav, and Joomla and see the same thing as well as in this room.
[2017-01-30 08:38:31] <N8Solutions> schas002: Thank you for letting me know.
[2017-01-30 08:40:51] <schas002>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-01-30 08:42:11] <schas002> 1) That's the latest status tweet from@gitchat, and it doesn't mention activity feeds. :/ 2) Use oneboxes that care about privacy.
[2017-01-30 09:01:15] <N8Solutions> thanks for sharing
[2017-01-30 11:53:14] <dsernst> Is there a way to install Gitter to a custom URL? Like chat.anotherdomain.com
[2017-01-30 11:53:56] <dsernst> Tried searching for this, not seeing anything
[2017-01-30 12:00:24] <schas002> No, Gitter Enterprise isn't yet released.
[2017-01-30 12:01:05] <dsernst> 
[2017-01-30 12:01:51] <schas002> But as we all know, you can set up a Node.js duck-tape solution and make your own chat :P
[2017-01-30 12:02:31] <dsernst> Oh clever. Sync'd with gitter?
[2017-01-30 12:03:18] <schas002> No, it won't be using Gitter unless you make it so.
[2017-01-30 14:07:25] <ShalokShalom> hi there
[2017-01-30 14:07:36] <ShalokShalom> why do you implement a feature and hide it from the users then?
[2017-01-30 14:08:57] <ShalokShalom> picture upload - there is no upload button, no hint about it in the markdown help.
[2017-01-30 14:14:08] <schas002> It's adarkskill, and the most dedicated to it are the only ones that know them.
[2017-01-30 14:14:50] <schas002> It's easy to make it amadskill, but we need an admin...
[2017-01-30 14:15:54] <ShalokShalom> ?
[2017-01-30 14:20:52] <schas002> !
[2017-01-30 14:21:11] <schas002> We need to ask them to show it to mankind.
[2017-01-30 14:23:07] <ShalokShalom> is any developer here?
[2017-01-30 15:47:34] <InternetUnexplorer> schas002: I'm dying  that's great
[2017-01-30 15:58:43] <InternetUnexplorer> ShalokShalom: The feature isn't hidden per se, and plenty of people know about it. The devs just don't go out of their way to shove it in the user's face, using 'tips' or some other mechanism. Gitter is far from perfect, but it has a fairly small development team behind it, so be patient. In the absence of documentation (There actually is some, but it's called 'topics' IIRC and it's not easy to find), people share the features they discover with others.
[2017-01-30 15:59:05] <viluon> InternetUnexplorer: /@schas002didn't get that reference..? :/
[2017-01-30 16:01:42] <schas002> InternetUnexplorer: There's also [<-LINK->] 
[2017-01-30 16:34:32] <ShalokShalom>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-01-30 16:34:40] <ShalokShalom> this have nothing to do with 'small team'
[2017-01-30 16:34:56] <ShalokShalom>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-01-30 16:35:03] <ShalokShalom> this is just a sign of lazyness
[2017-01-30 16:35:58] <mydigitalself> yeah, sorry for being lazy
[2017-01-30 16:36:35] <mydigitalself> do we need to have one forquery=spreadsheetsquery=documentsquery=mp3s? just drag and drop, it just works.
[2017-01-30 16:38:15] <schas002> How do I upload CSV, Markdown, and WAV files?
[2017-01-30 16:38:28] <schas002> They aren't readable in the browser whatsoever!
[2017-01-30 18:07:07] <geekyi> schas002: drag and drop works for me. Copy paste works for me too
[2017-01-30 18:07:40] <geekyi> How do I upload CSV, Markdown, and WAV files?What I would do is use another content hosting site and link to there
[2017-01-31 01:13:48] <tbaker4802> schas002: the easiest thing to do is to just do what geekyi just said... if you put a link to something like a video or an image, it will take the image and display it below the link inside of gitter.
[2017-01-31 01:14:09] <tbaker4802> I have tried the drag and drop, but when i do that it will sometimes mess things up strangely and i have to restart the app or refresh the page
[2017-01-31 01:14:41] <tbaker4802>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-01-31 01:14:56] <tbaker4802> hmm maybe it doesn't display it, i dont' know sorry :P
[2017-01-31 01:15:15] <tbaker4802>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-01-31 01:15:35] <tbaker4802> dragging an image from explorer works, dragging an image from a browser does not.
[2017-01-31 18:58:36] <grahamperrin> pysantanyi_twitter: re: [<-LINK->] which two or three things bug you the most?
[2017-02-01 06:45:22] <glennbennett> I have a question i have an html doc im trying to view on the web but when i open google chrome i get an error access denied page. What am i missing?
[2017-02-01 08:36:43] <kaksofficial_twitter> glennbennett: do you mean viewing its source code or you are visiting normally
[2017-02-01 08:38:51] <glennbennett> I figured it out. Chrome doenst support that so ihad to open the doc in another browserrl
[2017-02-01 08:40:51] <kaksofficial_twitter> Great
[2017-02-01 09:30:20] <desiredpersona> Is it possible to change a group name?
[2017-02-01 09:35:22] <schas002> Nah.
[2017-02-01 10:01:58] <pysantanyi_twitter> grahamperrin:  [<-CODE->] 
[2017-02-01 11:26:03] <grahamperrin> pysantanyi_twitter: thanks. The first is reminiscent of [<-ISSUE->] , which is closed but (to me) the symptoms remain horribly problematic and I can not positively identify the symptoms here with other, open, issues that are linked from the closed one.
[2017-02-01 11:26:25] <grahamperrin> Do you use Firefox?
[2017-02-01 11:28:51] <pysantanyi_twitter> I do, but I tested in Chromium and found the same issues. I have been using gitter little these last few days, so I might have not noticed if some issues were fixed in the meantime
[2017-02-01 11:29:17] <grahamperrin> Search: [<-ISSUE->]  [<-ISSUE->]  [<-ISSUE->] and so on, without wishing to disrespect the developers/designers it seems to me that the current integration is too ambitious. It would be better to offer a dedicated search page that works reliably; without moving targets, and so on.
[2017-02-01 11:29:40] <grahamperrin>  [<-ISSUE->] is not properly fixed. A frequent annoyance.
[2017-02-01 11:30:00] <grahamperrin> pysantanyi_twitter: FYI [<-LINK->] 
[2017-02-01 11:32:31] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] there's a link to a list of things that bugged me.
[2017-02-01 11:54:33] <pysantanyi_twitter> grahamperrin: Thanks, I will have a look at this. Gitter has great features but is a pity these small problems make the whole experience very frustrating and improductive
[2017-02-01 12:21:15] <grahamperrin>  Iamglad that Gitter was chosen.
[2017-02-01 14:33:49] <desiredpersona> schas002: thanks
[2017-02-02 06:53:01] <Hebgbs> Why are comment edits on GitHub counted as new comments in activity? I nearly spammed up the activity section in another chat because of that, which wouldn't be fair to issues that commanded the same priority, and can lead to potentially abusive behaviour by burying another issue with "Edits" to an intentionally typo-filled post.
[2017-02-02 08:12:09] <schas002> ^
[2017-02-02 08:24:23] <grahamperrin> @Hebgbs I view the ACTIVITY area of the sidebar as simply that: activity. (In no way indicative of priorities).Should intentionally abusive activity occur, it can/should be dealt with at the repo level.I don't foresee a need to change the behaviour of Gitter in response to editions; I like the notifications. YMMV.
[2017-02-02 08:31:42] <Hebgbs> it can/should be dealt with at the repo level.But it can also be dealt with here whereby editing the same one comment with more information doesn't post the same comment in activity. If there is more information to be had for a single bit of activity that is appended later, it should be the submitter's responsibility to announce there was an edit to said comment on gitter with significant information.If I forget some punctuation, misspelled a word, then saw Aw crap, I misspelled another one I shouldn't be polluting activity with those tiny, insignificant changes in any community. I don't check myself compulsively all the time to prevent these mistakes. That, and my laptop's keyboard sucks.I could also, y'know, leave the mistakes in but I don't want to look like I didn't make it out of high school with honours.
[2017-02-02 09:08:20] <grahamperrin> Preview.
[2017-02-02 09:58:20] <bjornharrtell> Hi, anyone else seen the problem with failure to create a default room for a private GitHub org? I get the modal dialog asking me if I want to create a room but nothing happens when clicking Create. I can see a 404 in the network traffic.. permissions are setup and I can create a repo-specific room without problems.
[2017-02-02 10:15:55] <mydigitalself> bjornharrtell: can you paste the error you are seeing and explain exactly the steps you are going through to create the room?
[2017-02-02 11:10:25] <bjornharrtell> There is no error message. But the steps are: 1. I go to the All Conversations pane under Your Organisations and click the organisation name. It brings up a modal dialog Create Room for <org> with body "The room GeoDanmark does not yet exist" and "Do you want to create it?". When clicking the Create nothing happens. In the network traffic I see 404 against [<-LINK->] 
[2017-02-02 22:11:43] <B5Bena_twitter> Hey can you guys help me with coding because I know nothing about coding? Or just send me a link to help
[2017-02-02 22:13:48] <MadLittleMods> B5Bena_twitter: This room is for Gitter support, not general technical support. Please read the welcome message when joining a room and mind the topic/description at the top of a room. You should probably go through [<-LINK->] 
[2017-02-02 22:17:45] <B5Bena_twitter> Sorry@MadLittleMods
[2017-02-03 04:29:35] <ramses0> FYI... github issue links posted to chat rooms are "too cute" and don't support direct ctrl-click to open in new tab.
[2017-02-03 04:30:47] <MadLittleMods> ramses0: See [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-02-03 04:30:49] <ramses0> Also fenced code blocks are currently sub-optimal in their rendering behaviour (unless you type them exactly right they tend to have poor rendering)
[2017-02-03 04:31:23] <ramses0> MadLittleMods: sweet! only need to wait 3 more years for it to get fixed!
[2017-02-03 04:32:07] <MadLittleMods> ramses0: Example of code fence and how it could be better?
[2017-02-03 04:34:10] <ramses0>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-02-03 04:35:10] <ramses0> MadLittleMods: thanks for having stuff at your fingertips
[2017-02-03 04:37:18] <ramses0> i think what often happens is i'll put XXXfoo XXX
[2017-02-03 04:37:38] <ramses0> where "XXX" represents backticks, and gitter freaks out unless you put them exactly on lines by themselves
[2017-02-03 04:39:00] <ramses0> also i'm surprised that gitter.im messages are not highlighted specially ;-) ... hack-day project?  :P
[2017-02-03 04:40:49] <MadLittleMods> @ramses0 Do you know of another markdown renderer/site that handles that situaion?foo ```code```
[2017-02-03 04:42:26] <MadLittleMods> @ramses0 The syntax highlighting is highlight.js. We only auto-detect a few languages but you can specify something specifically```html<div></div>```
[2017-02-03 07:27:31] <grahamperrin> Hint: implementing [<-ISSUE->] will help to ease the pain associated with [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-02-03 07:33:44] <grahamperrin> SuggestionIn the sidebar to the left, the search icon should be uppermost. Logically, from the top:an icon for a function
an icon for conversations, group
an icon for conversations, personal
an icon for conversation groups– the three conversation-related icons no longer separated from each other by a function-related icon.
[2017-02-03 07:38:27] <schas002> Put search icon up: , , , ,  or  to ?
[2017-02-03 07:40:06] <schas002> Myself, I'm somewhat between  and  - I like the sidebar the way it is, but it's good to remove logical separations.
[2017-02-03 07:42:19] <grahamperrin> Also with the current arrangement – the magnifying glass treated as second class (not uppermost) – it's visually jarring:the eye is naturally drawn to top left, where there is a circular icon but it's not for search
look down, to a different circular icon
click
the eye is unnecessarily drawn to the SHOUTED WORD that's uppermost (and uppermost is the row where it's normal to find a search icon, and we have the two circular icons above each other)
clicking SEARCH is not equivalent to clicking the icon for search
[2017-02-03 07:44:37] <grahamperrin> schas002: … the search UI is generally awful. I don't wish to offend the developers/designers; my frankness reflects the wish for a basic function to be user-friendly.
[2017-02-03 07:44:52] <grahamperrin> Moving targets: awful.
[2017-02-03 07:46:01] <grahamperrin> Putting metadata (authors, containers) before data (written content): awful.
[2017-02-03 07:49:26] <grahamperrin> Uppermost in the window there's a deep chunk of dead space that could be put to good use. Neither the icon for gitter nor the shouted GITTER links to a home for gitter.
[2017-02-03 07:49:42] <Hebgbs> grahamperrin: Except in some countries that read RTL, natural draw is top-right, from RTL or top to bottom depending on arrangement.
[2017-02-03 07:50:20] <Hebgbs> Writ lang is weird, man.
[2017-02-03 07:51:12] <grahamperrin> Hebgbs: thanks, do you mean that where language is written from left-to-right, the eye begins at theright?
[2017-02-03 07:52:37] <grahamperrin> I'm particularly interested in saccades because IMO Apple got it seriously wrong when they rushed in Yosemite without evidence of proper testing.
[2017-02-03 07:53:20] <Hebgbs> I have very little knowledge of RTL except that some places read RTL, not necessarily sure if it's written LTR and read in reverse.
[2017-02-03 07:53:27] <Hebgbs> This might be helpful; [<-LINK->] 
[2017-02-03 07:55:36] <Hebgbs> As I said, writ is weird.
[2017-02-03 07:56:33] <Hebgbs> Due to it, some places in the world may find this site unusable because of its affinity with top-left.
[2017-02-03 08:08:53] <schas002> I stripped an Atom v0.187.0 install from 73 packages to be run down to14, by disabling packages I don'treallyneed.
[2017-02-03 08:09:28] <schas002> All of these were core packages.
[2017-02-03 08:10:26] <schas002> Sadly, I have to enable Timecop to see how much faster it loads. :|
[2017-02-03 08:12:31] <schas002> It took 1 s 913 ms to load the window, with the status-bar being the laziest in loading at 82 ms, and the status-bar and tree-view being the laziest in activation at 69 ms and 29 ms respectively.
[2017-02-03 08:13:37] <schas002> The total time for loading packages is 136 ms and 150 ms for subsequently activating. 3 paks were 5ms+ in loading, 5 paks were 5ms+ in activating.
[2017-02-03 08:14:14] <schas002> (Yes, I ran in dev mode this whole time.)
[2017-02-03 08:14:47] <schas002> Gotta write a gist article. :3
[2017-02-03 08:28:14] <schas002> Whoops, I didn't realise I was in the wrong room. Sorry! XD
[2017-02-03 14:46:12] <wadie> For some reason I'm getting a 404 error when trying to join FreeCodeCamp's main room
[2017-02-03 14:46:46] <mydigitalself> wadie: what's the URL you are trying to access?
[2017-02-03 14:49:12] <wadie>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-02-03 14:51:15] <mydigitalself> works just fine for me - can you send a screenshot with error console open?
[2017-02-03 14:52:02] <wadie>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-02-03 14:52:42] <wadie> If I view that room without my account logged in, it's all fine
[2017-02-03 14:52:53] <wadie> It has to do with my account, but I don't think I'm banned there
[2017-02-03 14:53:00] <mydigitalself> that is probably exactly why
[2017-02-03 14:53:50] <wadie> There is no one to contact
[2017-02-03 14:54:00] <wadie> and no way to view that room to report this
[2017-02-03 14:54:01] <wadie> hmm
[2017-02-03 14:54:21] <mydigitalself> i'm sure they have contact details elsewhere, like Twitter or on their website or in other ways.
[2017-02-03 14:56:06] <wadie> have already contacted them, but no reply
[2017-02-03 14:56:14] <wadie> anyway it's probably only a ban right?
[2017-02-03 14:56:33] <mydigitalself> the behaviour you describe sounds exactly like a ban, yes
[2017-02-03 15:00:39] <wadie> ok thanks :)
[2017-02-03 19:15:49] <DoctorBud> I think there is a problem with the latest Gitter deployment (server-side). I had to disable CORS in my browser to be able to access any of my rooms (including this one), and my console shows the following: [<-CODE->] I cannot use the Gitter app (MacOSX) at all right now.Any news?
[2017-02-03 19:17:48] <MadLittleMods> DoctorBud: Those seem unrelated to being able to use the app. We are experiencing some issues atm [<-LINK->] 
[2017-02-04 08:47:14] <henninger_da_twitter> Hi, I try to understand this gitter ;-) Does someone know, if it is possible to create a gitter "room" and unlimited subrooms? For Example, I want to use it, to discuss about tickets. We use a ticketsystem for our clients. So I thought, i open by API for each ticket a chat, if a person will discuss about this ticket.
[2017-02-04 09:02:42] <MadLittleMods> henninger_da_twitter: You can create a community(+ plus button on menu bar(very left)) and create however many rooms("Add a room" button at the bottom of the room list) under it you want
[2017-02-04 10:22:19] <henninger_da_twitter> thanks for help
[2017-02-04 11:00:20] <dregad> Is there a problem with integrations ?
[2017-02-04 11:01:12] <dregad> I'm not seeing anything in the right-hand panes in any of the rooms I'm in, and I'm pretty sure the settings haven't been changed
[2017-02-04 11:05:05] <grahamperrin> dregad: I see the problem in at least one room with Firefox but not with QupZilla
[2017-02-04 11:05:50] <dregad> I'm on Firefox. I'll try with Chrome
[2017-02-04 11:06:14] <grahamperrin> At [<-LINK->] the lobby is affected.@dregadcan you share an example?
[2017-02-04 11:07:36] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-02-04 11:08:12] <grahamperrin> Maybe not everything is back in order.
[2017-02-04 11:08:45] <dregad> Same problem with Chrome.
[2017-02-04 11:09:15] <dregad> Noticed strange behavior, the activity pane "flashed" with updates, then went blank and now displaysWe haven't seen any activity yet. Configure your integrations
[2017-02-04 11:10:22] <dregad> This happens in [<-LINK->] , [<-LINK->] , [<-LINK->] 
[2017-02-04 11:10:45] <dregad> I'll try to clear cache, etc.
[2017-02-04 11:12:13] <dregad> Clearing cache did the trick, integrations are now showing in the above-mentioned rooms
[2017-02-04 11:12:18] <dregad> Weird
[2017-02-04 11:14:03] <grahamperrin> Firefox Control-F5 clearance had the desired effect for one of your examples but not for mine.
[2017-02-04 14:37:47] <lydatech> Has there been an update pushed out? Things have become very glitchy on gitter. Is it me or an update?
[2017-02-04 15:52:43] <RodMyers> It's gitter. The past days have been interesting
[2017-02-04 15:56:56] <grahamperrin> Above:@ramses0 The syntax highlighting is highlight.js. We only auto-detect a few languages but you can specify something specifically```html<div></div>```Re: https://highlightjs.org/usage/ I'm trying, failing, to present pre-formatted with no highlighting. The closest I have got so far (earlier attempts deleted by me) is https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/sandbox?at=5895f73ffef1d2de52a8fa94
[2017-02-04 15:57:20] <grahamperrin> What am I doing wrong?

[2017-02-04 21:54:12] <dregad> As mentioned previously, clearing browser cache did the trick for me.
[2017-02-04 21:58:58] <aryanakul> dregad: i tried clearing the cache but it is still not showing anything on the right panel
[2017-02-04 23:07:41] <RodMyers> Try logging out, then back in

[2017-02-05 13:06:51] <lydatech> how do i see only active/online users in a room?
[2017-02-05 14:33:15] <lydatech> how do I see our ban list of users who have been banned?
[2017-02-05 15:35:06] <mydigitalself> grahamperrin: ```text
[2017-02-05 15:36:26] <mydigitalself> @lydatech you can't, due to some rooms with massive amounts of users, the sorting algorithm was causing huge load issues on the server, so it's disabled until we have a better solution.there also isn't a way to see a ban list yet
[2017-02-05 15:38:29] <lydatech> mydigitalself: can I get to it through the API?
[2017-02-05 15:38:55] <grahamperrin> mydigitalself: thanks, [<-LINK->] , where did you find the answer? Or did you guess?
[2017-02-05 16:31:12] <mydigitalself> lydatech: nope
[2017-02-05 16:32:17] <lydatech> mydigitalself: ok tanks
[2017-02-05 18:51:03] <grahamperrin> Try logging out, then back inThanks Rod, I'll see how it goes.
[2017-02-05 18:52:22] <RodMyers> for me, it looks like it cleared the cache, or something similr
[2017-02-05 18:52:34] <grahamperrin> RodMyers: sorry, that's not a reliable workaround.
[2017-02-05 18:52:50] <RodMyers> weird, okay
[2017-02-05 18:59:16] <grahamperrin> Before the "weird, okay" reply there was the (recently familiar) empty sidebar to the right. When Rod's post appeared, the sidebar populated.
[2017-02-05 18:59:41] <grahamperrin> I proceeded to open new tabs to a number of rooms. Three oddities, each of which was worked around by a reload:

[2017-02-05 19:03:37] <RodMyers> the lack of bar on the right happened last week
[2017-02-05 19:23:32] <InternetUnexplorer> grahamperrin: @RodMyersPossibly related to this? [<-LINK->] 
[2017-02-05 19:24:00] <RodMyers> very well could be
[2017-02-05 19:24:25] <RodMyers> i saw on IRC that one person mentioned the irc-gateway is still down
[2017-02-05 19:24:38] <InternetUnexplorer> As of right now, I have this:
[2017-02-05 19:25:03] <InternetUnexplorer> So, something is definitely amiss.
[2017-02-05 19:25:40] <RodMyers> is that  the browser or TrueOS app?
[2017-02-05 19:25:49] <InternetUnexplorer> Browser.
[2017-02-05 19:25:52] <grahamperrin> dark theme, I think
[2017-02-05 19:25:55] <RodMyers> I'm using the TrueOS app, and it's working
[2017-02-05 19:25:58] <InternetUnexplorer> Yes :)strange.
[2017-02-05 19:26:43] <grahamperrin> It's weird that the preferences menu does not offer the theme
[2017-02-05 19:27:04] <RodMyers> on the web browser, i'm not getting users on right. With the gitter app, I am
[2017-02-05 19:27:12] <InternetUnexplorer> Yes, it is.I've also tried reloading several times now, the messages appear briefly then disappear.
[2017-02-05 19:27:41] <RodMyers> on the browser (firefox), I can get all mesages, on all boards, and private chats. same with the gitter app
[2017-02-05 19:28:43] <grahamperrin> Firefox:
[2017-02-05 19:28:47] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-02-05 19:29:13] <RodMyers> same, except for themes
[2017-02-05 19:29:21] <RodMyers> though I have the users on the right
[2017-02-05 19:29:23] <InternetUnexplorer> Hmm, removing the?at=in the URL (Which was put in when I clicked 'Go to bottom' IIRC) made it work. Very strange.
[2017-02-05 19:29:35] <grahamperrin> Control-F5 works around, as it did originally, but (as with the log out approach) I don't expect any workaround to persist indefinitely. It's safe to assume that we'll not fix this without attention from the developers :-)
[2017-02-05 19:30:25] <InternetUnexplorer> Yes, indeed :)Well, I hope the problem is solved soon, it's a pain not to be able to see who is in a room.
[2017-02-05 19:30:57] <grahamperrin> Who said that?
[2017-02-05 19:31:03] <grahamperrin> Who's there?
[2017-02-05 19:31:12] <InternetUnexplorer> :P
[2017-02-05 19:32:21] <RodMyers> on the TrueOS gitter app, i see everyone in the room. using the browser, nothing shows
[2017-02-05 19:33:00] <grahamperrin> That app's simply a wrapper of some sort …
[2017-02-05 19:33:14] <RodMyers> yes
[2017-02-05 19:34:00] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-02-05 19:35:54] <RodMyers> that's why this makes no sense
[2017-02-05 19:38:23] <grahamperrin> When I first observed the problem it was with Firefox but not with Chromium. Idouse many extensions with Firefox.
[2017-02-05 19:38:48] <RodMyers> same
[2017-02-05 19:49:41] <Eiken> anyone else having issues with irc.gitter.im last week?
[2017-02-05 19:50:05] <Eiken> cant see what people write but can send messages
[2017-02-05 19:51:13] <RodMyers> that was last week. yes
[2017-02-05 19:51:35] <Eiken> i seem to have the same issue now as well
[2017-02-05 19:52:12] <Eiken> test from irc
[2017-02-05 19:53:54] <RodMyers> it seems that gitter is all over the place at the moment
[2017-02-05 20:00:44] <Eiken> got that message on irc but it  dont work for another channel
[2017-02-05 20:01:21] <Eiken> or maybe it does now
[2017-02-05 20:15:40] <mydigitalself> the issues with the bar on the right is related to the issues we had on Friday. tomorrow we'll look to reactivate it along with some other services (stream API & IRC).we're having some scaling issues with some of our infrastructure at the moment and are trying to resolve them.
[2017-02-05 20:18:13] <RodMyers> cool deal
[2017-02-05 20:27:39] <InternetUnexplorer> we're having some scaling issues with some of our infrastructureSounds fun :P. Good luck.
[2017-02-06 07:14:47] <osterman> I get a 502 accessing: [<-LINK->] 
[2017-02-06 07:59:09] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] the image presented by gitter does not match the image that is presented by GitHub.
[2017-02-06 07:59:44] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-02-06 08:00:03] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-02-06 09:23:19] <mydigitalself> grahamperrin: the link in the text doesn't actually return an image resource, but an HTML resource. the HTML resource has open social metadata in it effectively saying to display that image. you'll notice if you take the same link and paste it into Facebook, it picks up the same image
[2017-02-06 09:23:50] <mydigitalself>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-02-06 09:24:10] <mydigitalself> which effectively means it's a GitHub bug because they should be returning metadata to display the image resource in the git path rather than the user's avatar
[2017-02-06 09:25:14] <mydigitalself> alternatively, share the link that you get when you click on the Download button on that page

[2017-02-06 09:28:15] <grahamperrin> thanks@mydigitalself
[2017-02-06 17:34:23] <Deekor> Why dont I seem to be getting email notifications from my gitter chats? I have to log in to check if someone has mentioned me
[2017-02-06 17:56:33] <hrj> Deekor:  Came here to ask the same thing. I have been using gitter for several years without a problem, but since the last couple of months, no email notifications.
[2017-02-06 20:04:40] <d235j> I'm having issues with PMs not coming through on the IRC bridge. Is this a known problem?
[2017-02-06 21:42:02] <mydigitalself> d235j: nope, i received one earlier today without any issue
[2017-02-06 21:42:36] <RodMyers> and I just received notification of@mydigitalselfmessage
[2017-02-06 21:46:57] <mydigitalself> that's not a PM, i assumed that@d235jwas talking about 1:1 private messages
[2017-02-06 21:47:46] <RodMyers> ah, my bad
[2017-02-06 21:48:10] <RodMyers> i know some folke elsewhere were commenting as well on not getting notifications
[2017-02-06 21:55:44] <Deekor> mydigitalself: I have yet to receive a single notification since I signed up...
[2017-02-07 01:01:17] <javmoham> I have cloned consumer-driven-contract project from github. I need some more detail steps to run this projects. I am learner and try to rampup my knowledge. I would appriciate if someone provide me some detail steps.

[2017-02-07 01:48:50] <InternetUnexplorer> javmoham: You are in the wrong room; questions like that are better suited for gitterHQ/developers. This room is for Gitter supportonly.
[2017-02-07 02:03:14] <btcmacroecon> hello i created a silly game and put it on github but in process didnt see the license that I have done before where is it or what did i do wrong?
[2017-02-07 02:03:40] <btcmacroecon> dont know if in right room
[2017-02-07 02:03:43] <InternetUnexplorer> btcmacroecon: read the post right above this one.
[2017-02-07 02:03:49] <InternetUnexplorer> That might give you a hint.
[2017-02-07 02:04:03] <btcmacroecon> thanks
[2017-02-07 02:04:06] <InternetUnexplorer> np
[2017-02-07 12:31:56] <con-ssc> Currently my gitter app is not running anymore any suggestions why?
[2017-02-07 12:32:16] <con-ssc> the window stays white
[2017-02-07 12:33:20] <con-ssc> the devtools also stay white
[2017-02-07 12:34:52] <con-ssc>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-02-07 12:35:36] <RodMyers> quick fix, if it works, log out, clear cache, then log back in
[2017-02-07 12:35:45] <RodMyers> that's a 50/50 shot
[2017-02-07 12:36:02] <con-ssc> ;)
[2017-02-07 12:36:54] <mydigitalself> haven't seen that before...@MadLittleMods?
[2017-02-07 12:37:03] <mydigitalself> (who's probably sleeping atm)
[2017-02-07 14:03:17] <d235j> mydigitalself: it's not working for me; I see the message in the web interface but it doesn't come through via IRC.
[2017-02-07 14:49:30] <con-ssc> RodMyers: didn't help
[2017-02-07 15:42:20] <kbrock> General workflow question:I tend to chat with 10 rooms and 50 or 60 people - all of them are in my "All Conversations"I have ~15 favorited - since those are the main ones I call up.Sometimes I'm actively holding 5 or 6 concersations at the same timeHow do other people handle this?Only have active conversations in "All convesations"?Rearrange active conversations to top of "All Conversations"?Remove favorites? (I have trouble finding people, so I rely upon favorites)
[2017-02-07 16:35:44] <aeneasr> Is there a way to move an org to a new name?
[2017-02-07 16:35:52] <aeneasr> or chatrooms to a new org
[2017-02-07 16:51:18] <RodMyers> con-ssc: it was a wild shot at best.  The past few days, all k kinds of problems are rearing its head
[2017-02-07 17:58:38] <japanjeff> Hello all! Is a comprehensive list of emoji's supported in gitter available anywhere? Has anyone suggested something like that before?
[2017-02-07 18:36:08] <mydigitalself> japanjeff: we pretty much use: [<-LINK->] 
[2017-02-07 18:38:04] <mydigitalself> kbrock: wow, that's a lot of people you are talking to! haven't found a good solution to this tbh. I don't find Slack solves it well either - there's no sense of recent. whereas we have Favs, then recents - although this can split your focus in your case.
[2017-02-07 18:44:10] <japanjeff> Ah, perfect. Thanks Mike!
[2017-02-07 18:45:21] <mydigitalself> np!
[2017-02-07 19:49:59] <kbrock> mydigitalself: thanks
[2017-02-07 19:51:05] <kbrock> mydigitalself: do you keep your team as favorites?. Do you "hide" conversations with people like me (more of a one off converstaion) - but then if you wanted to contact me, how would your remember me?
[2017-02-07 19:51:45] <kbrock> search doesn't seem to work for me, and favorites is too much, and the list of one to one conversations is just too long :(
[2017-02-07 22:11:19] <CodeNonprofit> kbrock: @mydigitalselfJumping in here to share in the "too long" list of 1 on 1 conversations. The vast majority of my list are blank conversations, where I suspect someone has clicked through my name on [<-LINK->] and then not sent me a message, but is coming through on my end as a convo that has started.
[2017-02-07 22:12:07] <CodeNonprofit> In any case, I'm not sure how I can hunt for the conversations that really happened in the long list of one-on-ones
[2017-02-07 23:29:46] <andyczerwonka> Hi guys, I seem be having trouble creating a Gitter org from my Github org - the orgs don't show up, even though I have Gitter expressly listed in myoauth_application_policysetting on Github as per [<-LINK->] 
[2017-02-07 23:38:03] <andyczerwonka> Ideally I can just create an Organization from my Github org? I want a private organization with on the people invited that are part of my private Github org.
[2017-02-08 07:56:33] <con-ssc> is there a way to mark all conversations a read?
[2017-02-08 09:00:06] <mydigitalself> con-ssc: not all, only per conversation
[2017-02-08 09:00:45] <mydigitalself> kbrock: yip, i have 13 favourites, including rooms and people. i never hide conversations,  no.
[2017-02-08 09:01:35] <mydigitalself> andyczerwonka: can you tell us exactly what you are trying to do and what's happening?
[2017-02-08 13:22:56] <andyczerwonka> Sure. I have an org on Github. I would like to create a private community, where only people that have access to my Github org can join rooms in that community. The rooms are not 1:1 with the private repos, as some products are split across repos.
[2017-02-08 13:26:15] <andyczerwonka> When I try to create a new community, my org is not listed, even though Gitter is expressly listed on my orgs oauth policy
[2017-02-08 13:27:17] <andyczerwonka> Ideally my community is private, no public lobby, just private rooms
[2017-02-08 13:32:24] <kbrock> mike - thanks
[2017-02-08 18:42:30] <andyczerwonka> how do I add people to a community?
[2017-02-08 18:42:58] <andyczerwonka> not to a room, but to an Org/Community
[2017-02-09 03:08:27] <begin-imagedesign> Ive been looking for a chat tool that will allow me to embed my chat on website, almost identically to the Gitter landing page. If I were to make a private chat room, would it be possible to embed that chat room on a website as view only for folks landing on the page? I am looking for it to function almost like a multi-user liveblog.
[2017-02-09 09:37:56] <Souptacular> I need to change the credit card and VAT on my organizations pro plan for Gitter. I went to [<-LINK->] and I see my org and that it is on the Pro Plan. I only see a cancel button, and no other options to edit payment preferences. What do I need to do?

[2017-02-10 00:07:50] <InternetUnexplorer> RodMyers: local legion?
[2017-02-10 00:13:00] <RodMyers> wrong window, was meant for a private chat. fat fingers on this end
[2017-02-10 00:14:46] <InternetUnexplorer> :)
[2017-02-10 11:48:26] <alexknvl> I have recently created a GitHub organization and then found out that there is a dead community on Gitter with the same name already. As a result of default "all org members are admins" setting on that community to I got perms over one of the channels. Has this issue been reported? Is there a way to bind a Github organization to a community with a different name on GItter?
[2017-02-10 12:33:28] <rodrigortz> hello all
[2017-02-10 12:44:09] <rodrigortz> I installed gitter on my desktop but it just stays in the allow github login page...I'm behind a corporate proxy, but I can navigate to github and login...any ideas?
[2017-02-10 14:46:09] <CyrilWork> Hi I am new and I think there is a contrast issue in the landing page after registration
[2017-02-10 14:46:29] <CyrilWork> labels below action button are barely readable
[2017-02-10 14:46:51] <CyrilWork> here [<-LINK->]

[2017-02-10 15:27:29] <rodrigortz> InternetUnexplorer: no...it shows the allow github login screen...I hit the allow button, the window goes blank and after a few seconds minimizes to tray

[2017-02-14 22:23:36] <virusdave> will try again ;)In the gitter web app, how can i disable the unread count for all rooms?
[2017-02-15 11:08:52] <wattazoum> Hi there,I am on Gitter for quite some time now, I used to receive Email notifications about unread messages, but I don't receive them anymore. I might have click on theunsubscribelink... But I don't find a way to get them back. Can anyone help me ?
[2017-02-15 11:45:25] <dahumm> Hello! I’m new to gitter. Sounds a bit stupid, but how can i logout on gitter and login with another git account?
[2017-02-15 11:50:01] <dahumm> T
[2017-02-15 11:52:51] <mydigitalself> virusdave: in any room, if you go the room options icon (top right next to your avatar) and chooseNotificationsyou should see a link there to change your default and apply it to all rooms as well.
[2017-02-15 11:53:25] <mydigitalself> dahumm: click on yourself top right in the web/desktop UI, choose sign out - then sign into GitHub with your other account, and then sign back in again to Gitter.
[2017-02-15 16:52:16] <nikita-fuchs> Hey, is there already a way to mute users / prevent them from sending you DMs ? I know this was requested in 2014 already, but can't seem to find anything like that implemented
[2017-02-15 20:23:58] <mydigitalself> nikita-fuchs: in a 1:1 conversation, click on the options icon top right near your username and change notification settings toMute. they can still @ mention you, however, but in general this should shut them up. if someone is harassing you, feel free to report to us.
[2017-02-15 21:43:39] <nikita-fuchs> mydigitalself: thanks very much! It still would be useful to ignore users at least in a way that there would be only a tiny notification in the chat tellong you that specific user wrote something. It's just that some people are very annoying, and I don't want to be too direct. And their 10 requests for help and support ever hour really interrupt the conversation and make it impossible for other users having their issues seen and discussed in the channel.
[2017-02-15 21:44:00] <mydigitalself> mute will effectively do just that
[2017-02-15 21:44:12] <mydigitalself> you'll see a tiny little dot that there's new stuff from them
[2017-02-15 21:44:35] <mydigitalself>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-02-15 21:44:38] <mydigitalself> like that
[2017-02-15 21:49:15] <nikita-fuchs> Okay, but i'll still have to see their mesages in the channels?
[2017-02-15 21:56:59] <mydigitalself> oh right, you mean ignore a particular user in a channel - nope, that's not something we currently have i'm afraid
[2017-02-15 21:58:40] <nikita-fuchs> Ooh no.. It's such a pain, you wouldn't believe me
[2017-02-15 22:00:20] <nikita-fuchs> Nevertheless, thanks for this awesome tool, in bleeding edge developments more helpful than stackexchange right now :D
[2017-02-15 23:35:42] <aj-willi> how do i link code in chat?
[2017-02-15 23:35:45] <aj-willi> in format?
[2017-02-15 23:48:38] <revisualize> GITTER! I have some issues with your services. And I'm so upset.. I'm going to type letters on my keyboard.
[2017-02-15 23:49:14] <revisualize> 1 ... Why can't I block people that constantly PM me after I tell them to STFU and GTFO of my PMs?
[2017-02-15 23:50:05] <revisualize> 2 ... Why can I make two different types of   or   ... BUT! ... I can't make a shark? Give us the :shark:
[2017-02-15 23:51:17] <revisualize> ummm...
[2017-02-15 23:51:21] <revisualize> There was something else.
[2017-02-15 23:51:34] <revisualize> BUT! For now.. That's all that I have.
[2017-02-15 23:51:43] <revisualize> See.. Mad. grrr and stuff.
[2017-02-16 00:02:26] <InternetUnexplorer> revisualize: The lack of :shark: is something I agree is a serious problem. I hope they fix it ASAP. On a less important note, I agree that the ability to block idiots from spamming you would be nice.
[2017-02-16 00:03:40] <InternetUnexplorer> Oh wait, you already can mute people from PMing you. So, just :shark:, I guess.
[2017-02-16 00:05:35] <InternetUnexplorer> Also, is [<-ISSUE->] ever going to be fixed? It's been marked as 'ready' for an embarrassingly long time, especially when considering how simple a fix it is.
[2017-02-16 00:07:00] <revisualize> InternetUnexplorer: I don't want to mute all people.
[2017-02-16 00:09:06] <InternetUnexplorer> Right, it was mentioned above that you can mute individual PMs.
[2017-02-16 00:09:28] <InternetUnexplorer> And one PM/person, so you can mute certain people from PMing you.
[2017-02-16 00:09:33] <InternetUnexplorer> revisualize: 
[2017-02-16 00:10:01] <revisualize> Hmmm.. Okay. I didn't find it in any of the actual menus. Do I have to type /mute ?
[2017-02-16 00:11:12] <InternetUnexplorer> in a 1:1 conversation, click on the options icon top right near your username and change notification settings to Mute. they can still @ mention you, however, but in general this should shut them up. if someone is harassing you, feel free to report to us.
[2017-02-16 00:11:35] <revisualize> InternetUnexplorer: Okay. Thanks.
[2017-02-16 00:11:47] <revisualize> So... This no :shark: business.
[2017-02-16 00:11:54] <revisualize> We need to now get that sorted.
[2017-02-16 00:16:14] <revisualize> God, I hope people realize that I'm not taking this :shark: issue seriously. I'm over laughing my ass off.
[2017-02-16 00:16:43] <revisualize> But, damn it.. we need a :shark:
[2017-02-16 00:17:04] <InternetUnexplorer> InternetUnexplorer: puts pitchfork down
[2017-02-16 00:17:09] <InternetUnexplorer> What? You're not serious? I was about to open an issue.
[2017-02-16 00:18:58] <revisualize> I'm over here laughing my ass off.. Who in their right mind goes into a chat and makes a write-up about how they're pissed that they can't make a damn shark emoji. ... I think it would be cool. But, damn.. This conversation is making me laugh.
[2017-02-16 00:19:00] <InternetUnexplorer> You'd think that something that impacts usability so much should be fixed as soon as the devs can, right?
[2017-02-16 00:19:28] <revisualize> In that case
[2017-02-16 00:19:37] <revisualize> We need a :shark: and a :tank:
[2017-02-16 00:19:51] <InternetUnexplorer> Without :shark:, there's no point in living.
[2017-02-16 00:21:01] <revisualize> And we'll need a :shark: + :shark_face: and :shark_fin:
[2017-02-16 00:21:13] <InternetUnexplorer> (In all seriousness we should probably not fill the support room with :shark: discussion)
[2017-02-16 00:21:29] <InternetUnexplorer> (No matter how amusing it may be)
[2017-02-16 00:22:57] <InternetUnexplorer> 
[2017-02-16 21:44:10] <virusdave> mydigitalself: Thanks for the response.  However, that modal doesn't include a way to disable the unread count!  :(
[2017-02-16 23:49:03] <lmboricua> The ios app for gitter needs major improvements
[2017-02-16 23:58:39] <InternetUnexplorer> Both apps are basically unusable at this point.
[2017-02-17 00:02:52] <nikita-fuchs> Well, the andoid app does quite well, even though private chats sometimes won't load
[2017-02-17 00:04:47] <InternetUnexplorer> I'm on Android right now, pasting is broken, scrolling is slow and doesn't really work, many features are missing, you are ocasionally left trapped in a blank activity, notifications are inconsistent (either not showing or showing the same notification repeatedly), etc.
[2017-02-17 00:05:31] <InternetUnexplorer> Yesterday I had to post a message and delete it because scrolling was broken and ai could not see new messages.
[2017-02-17 00:45:14] <InternetUnexplorer> aj-willi: Please stop posting spam, you will be reported.
[2017-02-17 11:56:25] <luzfcb> Hello gitter devs, Has there been any change in the rules for sending by email, the notification of unread messages? I do not access gitter all the time, so this is a feature I liked.
[2017-02-17 12:08:30] <mydigitalself> luzfcb: we have some ongoing issues with email notifications whilst switching email provider - hope to have this 100% working soon
[2017-02-17 12:15:01] <luzfcb> mydigitalself: ok.
[2017-02-18 18:05:32] <beeman> Hello, I was wondering if somebody could help me get my room renamed :)
[2017-02-18 18:05:48] <beeman> I created an issue atsupport@gitter.imbut no reply, this might be quicker
[2017-02-19 03:51:42] <zcking> is there any group/room for Groovy questions?
[2017-02-19 03:53:08] <pdurbin> I'm not seeing much at [<-LINK->] 
[2017-02-19 03:53:26] <alexknvl> Apparently they use Slack - [<-LINK->] 
[2017-02-19 03:53:26] <zcking> hmm...welp :/
[2017-02-19 03:53:41] <zcking> I'm new to Gitter so wasn't sure
[2017-02-19 03:54:28] <zcking> I'm also new to Groovy so I was just looking for a general question-answering group lol.
[2017-02-19 03:54:54] <alexknvl> And you have to apply for it  :P Wow, what a way to be welcoming to newcomers:This information is not retained after the verification process. If we are unable to find your email address associated with one of the links provided, an employer's custom domain, or the Apache Groovy mailing list your request may be delayed or denied.
[2017-02-19 03:55:50] <alexknvl> I don't know why people like Slack so much. It doesn't have the single most important feature of Gitter - markdown with syntax-highlighting in triple quotes
[2017-02-19 03:56:34] <pdurbin> Gitter is better than Slack for open source because of the transparency.
[2017-02-19 03:57:48] <alexknvl> Btw this is technically not the right place to discuss this, there is a general gitterHQ/developers channel. This channel is supposed to be used for bug reports / issues with Gitter AFAIR.
[2017-02-19 03:58:23] <zcking> Whoops. Well now we know. Again, new to Gitter
[2017-02-19 03:59:14] <zcking> You'd think it'd be named gitterHQ/issues or something though...just sayin
[2017-02-19 05:36:49] <InternetUnexplorer> gitterHQ/developers is a trainwreck. While it has gotten better recently, I would redirect people there sparingly.
[2017-02-19 06:00:46] <alexknvl> Ah, didn't know. I usually don't venture outside of Scala related channels.
[2017-02-19 19:40:34] <dikiaap> I have my own gitter room. But I can't delete my room, maybe because leaving. How to fixed that?
[2017-02-19 20:27:48] <arch-master> dikiaap: What do you mean, "maybe because leaving”?
[2017-02-19 20:52:42] <gcoban> Hi, I am using Gitter Mac application, but everytime I click to a notification from Gitter, it doesn’t show the latest messages in the room. I had to scroll down to see the latest messages. It is a bug?
[2017-02-19 20:53:27] <arch-master> gcoban: Let me test that! Send me a message.
[2017-02-19 22:59:38] <InternetUnexplorer> arch-master: I think what@dikiaapmeans is that he suspects that he is unable to delete the room because he left it.
[2017-02-19 23:51:04] <arch-master> InternetUnexplorer: I understand. Can’t he just join it again?
[2017-02-19 23:51:25] <arch-master> gcoban: Yes. It is probably a bug.
[2017-02-20 00:37:29] <gmcdonald> Hi All, anytime I try and create a 'myorg/mychannel' it says address invalid. Even though 'myorg' is showing up fine to create. Any ideas?
[2017-02-20 05:09:08] <dikiaap> InternetUnexplorer: @arch-masteryes. I'm not owner anymore
[2017-02-20 06:10:23] <gcoban> arch-master: Is it not about direct messages, I mean the room :) Anyway, great app, thanks.
[2017-02-20 06:53:46] <ghost~5826a72ed73408ce4f354d4f> Matrix too .. :) better with Mobile..  Gitter gives me lot of repeated notifications on mobile though
[2017-02-20 11:18:39] <brillout> Hi! I own a Gitter chat room and I want users to always see my status as "online". Is there a way to have my status to always be set to online?
[2017-02-20 12:51:15] <kieranpotts> Hi. I cannot create a community for my GitHub project, BuildGem: [<-LINK->] . The chat room was created by me ( [<-LINK->] ) but I clicked a few buttons and the room has somehow ended up with no people or owners, so I can't delete it to start over. Can you help?
[2017-02-20 15:04:34] <mydigitalself> kieranpotts: if you click onAdd a roomat the bottom left, can you pick Buildgem in the community drop-down?
[2017-02-20 15:05:45] <mydigitalself> gmcdonald: what exactly are you trying to create? If you create a new community with the little+button in the bottom left, pick your org from GitHub etc...
[2017-02-20 16:01:00] <kieranpotts> mydigitalself: No, it's not there. I can see "buildgem" under "Your Organisations" (list of GitHub organisations). If I click that, the popup says "The room buildgem does not exist yet". Clicking the "Create" button on that popup does nothing - the popup stays and the room is not created.
[2017-02-20 16:02:26] <mydigitalself> i have a feeling i know what this is...
[2017-02-20 16:04:06] <mydigitalself>  [<-LINK->] <--- what does that look like, or what Gitter items are there vs [<-LINK->] 
[2017-02-20 16:55:08] <kieranpotts> mydigitalself: The OAuth Application Policy page lists TWO entries for "Gitter Private Repo Access" (both Approved), while my GitHub Authorized Applications page lists only ONE.
[2017-02-20 16:58:35] <mydigitalself> does one say Private and the other say Public?
[2017-02-20 17:12:59] <kieranpotts> Yup. I missed that. "Gitter Private Repo Access" and "Gitter Public Repo Access" are both entries in the OAuth Application Policy page. There's only "Gitter Public Repo Access" under Authorized Applications.
[2017-02-20 18:04:29] <mydigitalself> can you try add Gitter Private Repo Access to your own, wait a few minutes, refresh, then see if BuildGem appears on the Add a room dropdown?you should be able to add this scope under the Add a room modal, there should be a link to turn on access for private repos.alternatively, remove it from the oAuth Application Policy page, as above - wait a few mins, refresh and try again
[2017-02-20 18:35:41] <kieranpotts> mydigitalself: That's a step closer. I've got Gitter Private and Public Repo Access in my list of Authorized Applications on GitHub. And I can now see "BuildGem" in the dropdown list: Add a Room > Community. However, I still cannot create the "BuildGem" GitHub-based community. It fails with an error whichever way I try to do that. That might be because a community of this name already exists ( [<-LINK->] ), the one that has somehow got disassociated with my account. Appreciate your help Mike...
[2017-02-20 19:09:29] <mydigitalself> kieranpotts: what happens now if you click Buildgem under "Your Organisations" ?
[2017-02-20 19:10:42] <mydigitalself> and I assume you can create "buildgem/chat" using the Add a Room flow? or if you want to create a room for buildgem/buildgem then just type buildgem into the the room name (it should auto-complete with valid repo names)
[2017-02-20 19:11:28] <mydigitalself> /buildgem is just the community root, most users will just see a directory of rooms in the same way you see a list of repos in GitHub. rooms need to be created under the root e.g. buildgem/buildgem or buildgem/chat or whatever you want
[2017-02-20 20:56:51] <kieranpotts> mydigitalself: Hi Mike, yes, so in terms of adding a community for the buildgem organisation, that is still not working. From the Create New Community page, behind-the-scenes the API call to [<-LINK->] returns 409 Conflict...
[2017-02-20 20:58:24] <kieranpotts> However, I can now add rooms to the buildgem root, as you suggest. That wasn't working earlier, either! That will do me nicely for now. Really appreciate your help - thanks!
[2017-02-20 23:03:14] <shendengnian> 有中国的吗
[2017-02-21 01:22:08] <gmcdonald> mydigitalself: yeah I did all that, just any url I try it says is invalid
[2017-02-21 01:22:42] <gmcdonald> gitter public repos access is granted to the org
[2017-02-21 01:23:04] <gmcdonald> and in fact, we do have 5 communities under it already, just doesnt want to work for me
[2017-02-21 08:21:11] <peter37030686_twitter> 测试一下
[2017-02-21 12:28:24] <tombaker> Is there a command-line client for Gitter?   Gitter feels like a Twitter stream, perpetually pushing current chat off-screen, which is why I prefer to use Twitter from the command line, with [<-LINK->] .  Any thought of doing such a client?
[2017-02-21 12:30:38] <rebolek> tombaker: is this good enough? [<-LINK->] 
[2017-02-21 12:33:57] <tombaker> rebolek: thank you!  All I'd need, I guess, would be a command-line IRC client.  Any suggestions? I use OSX and Linux.
[2017-02-21 12:35:18] <rebolek> tombaker: Sorry, I can’t help here, I use Adium on OSX and Linux, but it’s not CLI client.
[2017-02-21 12:38:43] <tombaker> rebolek: Will it log a Gitter stream to a text file?  I still usemuttand MBOX format, which can begrepped.  I can't get used to having everything in the browser and cloud.  (I'm showing my age, I guess.)
[2017-02-21 12:45:02] <rebolek> tombaker: I haven’t used Gitter's IRC gate yet, I just know it exists, so I can’t help here Anyway, I guess that logging depends on client software, so if your favorite IRC client can do that, I guess it’s possible.
[2017-02-21 12:56:02] <tombaker> rebolek: ok, thanks!
[2017-02-21 12:57:13] <rebolek> tombaker: you’re welcome, wish I knew more :)
[2017-02-21 13:27:53] <frankleja> I'm new with gitter and could not find out, how to find my items and the mentions to it. If I ask a question, I have difficulties to find my answers to it. I could not figure out how to get this from search. Can anybody help?
[2017-02-21 13:30:19] <cbj4074> frankleja: I believe that you can simply search for your own username and any mentions of it will appear in the results.
[2017-02-21 13:55:13] <anbaoxin> help
[2017-02-21 14:54:28] <frankleja> cbj4074: hm, when I search for frankleja I got me, when I click on my name under rooms & people in Firefox, I get the both left stripes with search again and right is the explore panel - strangeI want to say thank's to the people helping me (it work!), but cannot find the answers (=mentions of me)
[2017-02-21 15:00:55] <cbj4074> frankleja: Don't click on yourself after searching forfrankleja. The results are below that, under theCHAT MESSAGESheading (notROOMS & PEOPLE)
[2017-02-21 15:01:13] <cbj4074> And they are fairly useless, in my opinion. They jump-around and are difficult to navigate. :/
[2017-02-21 15:01:32] <cbj4074> But any mention of you should be in that list of results.
[2017-02-21 15:56:24] <bitcoinmeetups> Hello
[2017-02-21 15:56:45] <arch-master> bitcoinmeetups: Hi
[2017-02-21 17:03:42] <frankleja> cbj4074: thank you Ben, this works in this room, but not in the room vuejs/vue, where I need it 
[2017-02-21 23:44:21] <ofek> for github pages if you have a repo named foo, does the address have to be [<-LINK->] or is it possible to make it foo.github.io?

[2017-02-22 04:11:06] <beeman> Hello, I was wondering if somebody could help me get my room renamed :)
[2017-02-22 04:11:15] <beeman> Anyone with permissions here?
[2017-02-22 04:11:31] <beeman> Or a pointer to where this can be done would be really appreciated
[2017-02-22 04:33:19] <darsparx> Anyone know how to add this to quassel? It shouldn't be this hard >_<
[2017-02-22 05:47:56] <InternetUnexplorer> Anyone with permissions here?You can try mentioning MadLittleMods or mydigitalself, they are often in this room. If all else fails, creating an issue should work, @beeman.
[2017-02-22 05:48:52] <beeman> Thanks@InternetUnexplorer
[2017-02-22 05:50:38] <beeman> MadLittleMods: @mydigitalselfcould one of you maybe help me get a channel renamed? O renamed the git repo and like the channel to rename too without losing the users. beeman/loopback-angular-admin is renamed to colmena/colmena-cms. Thanks in advance!
[2017-02-22 05:52:50] <MadLittleMods> beeman: Create thecolmenacommunity
[2017-02-22 05:56:28] <beeman> MadLittleMods: that's done :)
[2017-02-22 06:02:31] <MadLittleMods> beeman: Done  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-02-22 06:03:27] <beeman> Awesome@MadLittleModsthanks a bunch!
[2017-02-22 18:33:09] <brillout> "I own a Gitter chat room and I want users to always see my status as "online". Is there a way to have my status to always be set to online?" Any luck?
[2017-02-22 18:33:54] <Mikaela> I don't know, but I would guess irc.gitter.im to have that side effect
[2017-02-22 18:44:54] <brillout>   and can I be always online there?
[2017-02-22 18:45:48] <brillout> i.e. is there a headless irc client?
[2017-02-22 18:47:59] <brillout> ok yes there seem to be some, thanks for the tip@Mikaela
[2017-02-22 19:57:09] <pditommaso> Hi, I've just switched to Android Marshmallow and I'm not getting anymore Gitter notifications .. any idea what's wrong ?
[2017-02-23 01:18:31] <darsparx> ok I need some help, I still can't get connected using quassel and I know it's possibly or should be but it's not working for me....
[2017-02-23 01:25:13] <darsparx> never mind, I got it setup I was able to get myself up and running in quassel >_<
[2017-02-23 07:52:30] <awbacker> Gitter isn't showing the URL of links on hover.  I'm alittleworried about clicking links I can't see, as I would hope most people are.  Is this a bug?
[2017-02-23 10:22:41] <mydigitalself> awbacker: what links? i see links for external URLs just fine.
[2017-02-24 02:16:41] <awbacker> mydigitalself: for example (from a DRF post): > by the way it is easier somehow to peek on the drf source code about [<-LINK->] and [<-LINK->] .
[2017-02-24 03:25:29] <awbacker> hovering those gets me nothing at all
[2017-02-24 03:26:10] <awbacker> honestly, i'd prefer a click to open a context window showing the full url, and an "open" button to actually open it, but a hover is enough
[2017-02-24 08:35:50] <java-zg> Hello,can you please delete javazgmeetup owned conversations? I've deleted the github account but forgot to delete gitter conversations for that old account before that.
[2017-02-24 08:36:28] <java-zg> After creating that account I've seen that the general convention is to name user without the meetup suffix and then name the repo on github just meetup so that's why I've decided to delete the account.
[2017-02-24 10:01:41] <mydigitalself> awbacker: hovering both of those gives me links, what browser are you using?
[2017-02-24 10:06:23] <awbacker> mydigitalself: Didn't really think of that.. .using the os-x app
[2017-02-24 10:06:33] <awbacker> html inside, and all that, but its the osx wrapper at least
[2017-02-24 10:09:49] <mydigitalself> ah, right. yeah, you are right markdown links won't display any url in the desktop app
[2017-02-24 11:06:32] <awbacker> ah, ok.  i figured its a web view in the desktop app, and so assumed it would show
[2017-02-24 11:06:51] <awbacker> but... thats a browser feature ;) it's not some in-built part of html :D
[2017-02-24 11:24:24] <atiqmasood> hi anyone here to help me in react.js
[2017-02-24 19:13:10] <InternetUnexplorer> atiqmasood: Wrong room. Ask in [<-LINK->] 
[2017-02-24 19:55:47] <gojko> hi. is there a way to disable topics for a community? We occasionally get someone posting in an automatically created topic, and the notifications on topics don't seem to work (at least for me), so I don't see the message until it's too late. If possible, I'd like to just remove the topics and force everyone to chat in a single channel.
[2017-02-25 18:45:01] <Nonsensical5> Does anyone have a suitable chat room for  quasi-begginners
[2017-02-25 18:47:10] <Nonsensical5> Or know any mentor like accounts to follow and study from
[2017-02-25 18:48:14] <InternetUnexplorer> Nonsensical5: This is a support room. Questions like that are better off in gitterHQ/developers.
[2017-02-26 08:12:58] <DavidDudson> Is there an easy way to find the roomId for a given room in the web interface?
[2017-02-26 10:06:16] <Salih_Freakzzz_twitter> I'm new here and Any one help me , I can't find a chat room based on web penetration testing and Kali Linux
[2017-02-26 10:29:19] <grahamperrin> This room is for gitter itself.@Salih_Freakzzz_twitterbrowse the list of topics and rooms at [<-LINK->] – the developers room, maybe.
[2017-02-26 15:34:25] <pdurbin> I just opened [<-ISSUE->] and I'd be curious to know if anyone can reproduce it.
[2017-02-27 09:51:37] <lankygit> Hello, team! When I join a room, I often get a pop-up - I see on Twitter that you call that the "Welcome message" - once I'm in the room, there doesn't seem to be any way to see that pop-up text - I expected to see it in a room description or junder room settings (as I think the room owner would see it there) - is the only way to see that text again really for me toleave roomand join again? What have I missed?
[2017-02-27 10:26:56] <atiqmasood> in one who help me in react
[2017-02-27 10:27:08] <atiqmasood> i have a problem in import and export
[2017-02-27 13:12:54] <mydigitalself> lankygit: there isn't currently a way to see it again
[2017-02-28 03:22:00] <lhunath> So, I went to create a community for my organization, and specified "lyndir" as my organization domain, which it linked to github.com/Lyndir, and "masterpassword" as the community name, thinking I was creating a "masterpassword" room inside the domain.  Apparently, that is not what it does and it created a gitter community at [<-LINK->] called "masterpassword".  Can I get this community renamed to "lyndir"?
[2017-02-28 03:28:01] <lhunath> Interestingly, gitter itself can't seem to make up its mind on what to call this organization, calling it "masterpassword" in some places and "lyndir" in others...  quite buggy.
[2017-02-28 03:28:29] <lhunath> Perhaps I can just delete this and start over somehow?
[2017-02-28 04:02:54] <lhunath> where would I go for technical support on this?
[2017-02-28 04:10:17] <InternetUnexplorer> lhunath: Try mentioning MadLittleMods, he is often around here.
[2017-02-28 04:12:49] <lhunath> MadLittleMods: It would be grand if I could get an opinion on the above or a pointer on how to go about reporting this issue in a way it can get looked into / resolved.  It appears communities are rather immutable right now and furthermore communities with names that do not match their domain cause countless strange bugs.
[2017-02-28 04:16:41] <MadLittleMods> lhunath: done [<-LINK->] :)
[2017-02-28 04:19:36] <lhunath> MadLittleMods: thanks a bunch!  Strangely, I cannot add a Lyndir room in the organization, it says the room already exists.  It said the same of "masterpassword" before (after I deleted that room).  But since your change, I was able to create the "masterpassword" room.  It seems perhaps it locks down on the ability to create a room that matches the community name?
[2017-02-28 04:23:35] <MadLittleMods> lhunath: You should be able to createLyndir/Lyndir. If you are wanting a root roomLyndir, that's not possible with the new communities
[2017-02-28 04:24:56] <lhunath> It says, "You cannot create a channel with a same name that as an already existing repo".
[2017-02-28 04:25:19] <lhunath> Sounds like a bit of a confused error message, though.  :–)
[2017-02-28 04:25:52] <lhunath> I don't think gitter has repos.
[2017-02-28 04:27:32] <MadLittleMods> lhunath: Ahhh, you need to associate the room with the repo. Choose it from the list on the dropdown although it should auto-associate if you type the directly and we have access. If you aren't seeing any repos as you type a room name, perhaps you need to grant access [<-LINK->] 
[2017-02-28 04:28:33] <lhunath> Oh - the confusion is mine, then.  I guess gitter rooms all need a repo association; I thought I could create a generic "organization" room.
[2017-02-28 04:28:58] <lhunath> I do not have a Lyndir repo.
[2017-02-28 04:29:11] <MadLittleMods> lhunath: You can create a room not associated with a repo. But if there is a name clash with GitHub, it needs to have the GitHub association as well
[2017-02-28 04:31:43] <lhunath> So I'd like to create a Lyndir/Lyndir room, not associated with any repo, it shouldn't clash with anything; and there exists no GitHub repo with the name Lyndir.  And yet I get the above error message; though perhaps I am doing something wrong.  I'm just hitting "Add a room" down at the bottom of the all conversations list, picking my "lyndir" community form the list and typing the "Lyndir" room name.  As soon as I type the "r", the error appears.
[2017-02-28 04:38:22] <MadLittleMods> lhunath: I see [<-LINK->] 
[2017-02-28 04:38:50] <lhunath> Face palm.
[2017-02-28 04:40:11] <lhunath> Sorry about that.
[2017-02-28 04:40:14] <InternetUnexplorer> But if there is a name clash with GitHub, it needs to have the GitHub association as wellSo I'd like to create a Lyndir/Lyndir room, not associated with any repo
[2017-02-28 04:40:31] <InternetUnexplorer> Found your problem
[2017-02-28 04:40:33] <lhunath> Yeahh...

[2017-02-28 17:43:53] <MadLittleMods> 2012728: What room? Why is this troll an admin of the room?

[2017-02-28 17:57:51] <BenQ77> lydatech:

[2017-02-28 17:59:25] <MadLittleMods> Please answer the other questions. Also why is@lydatechgoing along with the troll?
[2017-02-28 17:59:34] <gavdbreeden> It was main chat if im not mistaken

[2017-02-28 18:12:57] <lxBlakexl> 
[2017-02-28 18:14:00] <BenQ77> i was also a victim of wrong-doing@MadLittleMods
[2017-02-28 18:18:57] <mburroughs2408> 
[2017-02-28 18:28:56] <7heo> That person definitely didn't test their bot beforehand...
[2017-02-28 18:29:16] <7heo> it doesn't read like they planned, I bet.
[2017-02-28 18:31:13] <mydigitalself> argh, thought i copied his username before deleting those messages, clearly not
[2017-02-28 18:31:18] <MadLittleMods> mydigitalself: I got him (all taken care of)

[2017-02-28 23:49:57] <jpitts> hi, I am at an org with a Pro Plan on gitter, we have been having issues with updating the billing... basically we are only presented with a "Cancel" button next to our org name when we select "Billing" in our account menu
[2017-02-28 23:51:28] <jpitts> there is no "Edit" button presented or other clear way to config the account other than the feared "Cancel" button, I must not be alone in wondering what is up with this unusual UI
[2017-02-28 23:54:07] <MadLittleMods> jpitts: What are you trying to update?
[2017-02-28 23:54:29] <jpitts> CC info, and generally see the configuration for the organization's account in [<-LINK->] 
[2017-02-28 23:55:47] <jpitts> I may not be an admin on this thing, I should be, but the person who has admin privs sees the same thing I do
[2017-03-01 00:18:30] <MadLittleMods> jpitts: I don't have a pro org to verify but looking at the source, you might be able to change things via [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-01 00:22:35] <jpitts> thanks for checking that, unfortunately it redirected to [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-01 00:40:00] <MadLittleMods> jpitts: What is the username of the person who set up the billing? Have them try [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-01 00:42:39] <jpitts> ok, will try that, thx again
[2017-03-01 00:56:56] <jpitts> I'll PM you the username...
[2017-03-01 08:22:13] <JakeDVirus> my gitter desktop is not showing up the interface page in my screen though it is showing up in my toolbar as it is running. how to fix this
[2017-03-01 11:48:13] <adil_soomro_twitter> Hey Guys, good day!I'm not sure if its the right place to ask, so apologies.How can I rename my account handle. I want to remove_twitterfrom my account username.
[2017-03-01 13:51:01] <cbj4074> adil_soomro_twitter: Somebody asked about this a few weeks ago and if memory serves, you just need to login using your GitHub credentials instead. I think that'll update your handle here.
[2017-03-01 15:50:22] <AdilSoomro> cbj4074: I'm now logged in using github.
[2017-03-01 15:50:40] <AdilSoomro> it seems to be resolved.
[2017-03-01 16:00:05] <cbj4074> AdilSoomro: 
[2017-03-01 16:16:03] <AdilSoomro> Although its using my github account, but the other twitter account still exist.
[2017-03-01 16:17:17] <AdilSoomro> I can still see it in the people section of room..
[2017-03-01 16:24:42] <cbj4074> Yeah, I think that for all intents and purposes, they are two separate accounts.
[2017-03-01 16:25:06] <cbj4074> So, stick to one or the other. Maybe there's some way to de-authorize the Twitter one so it'll disappear.
[2017-03-01 16:25:20] <cbj4074> (If there is, I don't know what it is :/ )
[2017-03-01 16:26:00] <AdilSoomro> ah right, I think I'll have to write to support to get that deleted.
[2017-03-01 16:30:09] <lydatech> MadLittleMods: I need a perm ban and a bit of help
[2017-03-01 16:31:21] <lydatech> MadLittleMods: Pm when you get a change please

[2017-03-02 09:19:40] <saparvia> 
[2017-03-02 15:21:36] <InternetUnexplorer> Metoer2017: Hi meteor. Unless you enjoy introducing yourself before asking for technical support relating specifically to the gitter chat service, I suspect you may be in the wrong room.
[2017-03-02 15:22:34] <InternetUnexplorer> saparvia: If your messages aren't getting through, perhaps mention MadLittleMods. He is often active in this channel and can likely find out why your emails haven't been getting through.
[2017-03-02 15:26:58] <darsparx> ok I'm a little werided out, I'm using the irc connection and I'm wondering why is the thing constantly rebooting itself at least 2-3 times a day?
[2017-03-02 15:28:18] <InternetUnexplorer> darsparx: Services have been having some issues a few weeks ago. I heard that they were resolved, I guess not?
[2017-03-02 15:29:02] <darsparx> nope, it's still rebooting several times it did it twice last night apprently
[2017-03-02 15:30:16] <darsparx> actually 4 times
[2017-03-02 15:30:37] <ShaikNazeer> hi team am getting unsafe image unsafe:data:image/jpeg;base64,/9.........  in Angular 2  plz help
[2017-03-02 15:30:38] <InternetUnexplorer> Hmmm. This is why gitter needs a service status page. If I had time, I'd make one, but it would be better if there was an official one.
[2017-03-02 15:31:17] <InternetUnexplorer> ShaikNazeer: stop it. You're in the wrong room and you've been pasting that question everywhere. Questions like that are not for this room.
[2017-03-02 15:31:51] <ShaikNazeer> sorry  which room is correct can you please tell me
[2017-03-02 15:32:11] <InternetUnexplorer> gitterHQ/developers. I see you already posted there.
[2017-03-02 15:33:16] <ShaikNazeer> ok thank you
[2017-03-02 15:34:56] <InternetUnexplorer> No problem. I didn't mean to sound cross, sorry about that.
[2017-03-02 15:37:52] <darsparx> shaiknazer: yeah you'd be better off in #angular/angular.js
[2017-03-02 15:38:38] <InternetUnexplorer> ^
[2017-03-02 15:39:09] <InternetUnexplorer> Completely forgot about that, thanks@darsparx.
[2017-03-02 15:39:39] <darsparx> yeah I only know of it because I'm in there though I've not messed with angular in forever since I'm more focused on my c++ stuff right now

[2017-03-02 18:09:02] <gavdbreeden> MadLittleMods: Can u help?
[2017-03-02 19:13:25] <darsparx> man if that's why gitter says irc is constantly shutting down that is really annoying. It's still doing it alot ofr me
[2017-03-02 19:13:29] <darsparx> for me*
[2017-03-02 22:49:37] <ackalker> gitterHQ/gitter/issues/366 Why is linkifying git hash not working in termux/termux?
[2017-03-02 22:50:28] <ackalker>  [<-ISSUE->] damnit, both syntaxes should work imo, copy/paste part of Github URL is convenient.
[2017-03-02 22:53:37] <ackalker> linkifying issues etc. is nice, but linkifying git hashes is an important feature as well, e.g. when discussing bisected bugs etc.
[2017-03-03 00:23:29] <sausagejohnson> Hi guys, been using gitter for a while but noticing an issue on one machine only: The edit button is always disabled. I know it disables after a period of time.
[2017-03-03 00:23:45] <sausagejohnson> But on that machine, "edit" disables immediately.
[2017-03-03 00:24:10] <sausagejohnson> And this is on both chrome and firefox. I have tried dumping cookies and cache, but no change.
[2017-03-03 00:24:43] <sausagejohnson> Anyone else observe this behaviour? Anywhere else I log into gitter, no problem.
[2017-03-03 01:28:33] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @gavdbreedenBetter to ask your question right away. Don't ask to ask. What's up?
[2017-03-03 01:30:39] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @ackalkerUse the longer syntaxorg/repo@sha [<-ISSUE->] -termux/termuxisn't associated with a repo
[2017-03-03 01:31:36] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @sausagejohnsonAre you sure you are trying to edit your own messages? Perhaps you are signed into two different accounts (Twitter vs GitHub)
[2017-03-03 02:17:54] <sausagejohnson> MadLittleMods: HI Eric, no I don't have the twitterz. Only a github account. Been using gitter for a while now, these are messages I write, that are immediately locked off from editing.
[2017-03-03 02:18:52] <MadLittleMods> sausagejohnson: Your computer date/time is probably off (common cause of this)
[2017-03-03 02:19:50] <sausagejohnson>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-03 02:20:33] <sausagejohnson> MadLittleMods: I'm on the machine now, my local time is 1:20PM, and display time is 12:20 so this looks likely to be the issue.
[2017-03-03 02:24:58] <sausagejohnson> Not clear how to resolve as my local region and time are correct. The site interprets incorrectly from this machine. I'll compare with the other machine as see if I can track it down.
[2017-03-03 02:26:02] <MadLittleMods> sausagejohnson: Go into your OS time/date settings and sync it or manually set to the correct local time
[2017-03-03 02:26:41] <sausagejohnson> My local time is correct.
[2017-03-03 02:44:49] <sausagejohnson> Mind you in one place, local is an hour forward, so need to work out how to change that. Anyway that appears to be the culprit well enough. Thanks for the advice,@MadLittleMods
[2017-03-03 09:38:09] <mydigitalself> darsparx: we're not sure, we were only made aware of this recently, for some reason none of our alerting systems were telling us that the ircd was being restarted
[2017-03-03 10:31:47] <matrixbot> @QuentinT:matrix.orgdoes anyone use osmocom？
[2017-03-03 14:11:43] <brianamarie> MadLittleMods: Any ideas on how to get my userbillyyumyum2x2functional again?

[2017-03-03 16:17:47] <darsparx> it's done it 3 times since I looked yesterday
[2017-03-03 16:17:47] <darsparx> mydigitalself: well it's definitely still doing it, it's weird
[2017-03-03 16:22:24] <MadLittleMods> brianamarie: done :)
[2017-03-03 16:25:12] <brianamarie> Thank you@MadLittleMods! 
[2017-03-03 16:28:58] <Villian79> Hello to all of you, guys! When I help someone to solve a problem I get those cookies from Gitter. Could you please tell what they are for and where I can find their amount I've earned? Thanks and sorry if my question is a naive one 
[2017-03-03 16:33:20] <MadLittleMods> Villian79: I assume you mean brownie points or something similar which are given by bots people setup in their rooms, not part of Gitter directly. You would need to look for the commands they have setup to check your balance
[2017-03-03 16:34:47] <Villian79> MadLittleMods: Got it! Thanks a lot!
[2017-03-04 03:37:10] <dereklearnscode> Does github sync via gutter and free code adjacent?
[2017-03-04 05:34:49] <jibbers42> Anyone on Ubuntu (Unity) and use Discord? I notice if you try to lock both Gitter and Discord to the launcher, Unity gets really confused about which app is which. Not sure if thats a Gitter or Discord issue though, or both (or Unity I guess, lol).I'm finding it surprisingly difficult to see what version of Discord I'm running, but the last file I downloaded was called discord-0.0.1.deb, gitter: v3.1.0
[2017-03-04 05:54:15] <grahamperrin> What's the proper way to report offensive posts? [<-LINK->] no answer
[2017-03-04 05:58:01] <grahamperrin> Also, how can I identify the owner of a room? [<-LINK->] mentions a blue bottom border, I see no such border.
[2017-03-04 06:00:53] <grahamperrin> Here for example I see two avatars that appear to be cropped (not square), with a thin white line (not thick enough to complete the square), and when I point at each one there's nothing to explain why the avatar is a different shape. Is@suprememoocowan owner?
[2017-03-04 06:03:25] <grahamperrin> Where [<-LINK->] shows@cutandpasteyas non-square with a white line, is he an owner there?
[2017-03-04 06:07:03] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-04 06:26:25] <grahamperrin> … If you link the community to an organisation, this means that all members of the organisation on GitHub will be admins of your community. …– OK, the phrase gitterHQ/developers refers to https://github.com/gitterHQ then https://github.com/orgs/gitterHQ/people shows four people including @suprememoocow and @cutandpasteyThere should be a more intuitive method to simply report offensive posts.Now that I have discovered a long method, here's the first of the offences:https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/developers?at=58b7145af1a33b6275681da4
[2017-03-04 12:40:43] <pdurbin> "Any room admin can now delete messages from other users now." according to [<-LINK->] . Flagging spam is an open issue, it appears: [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-03-04 13:35:14] <grahamperrin> grahamperrin: thanks@pdurbinand subscribes to the issue.
[2017-03-04 14:57:13] <pdurbin> pdurbin: subscribed too
[2017-03-05 10:46:19] <mydigitalself> grahamperrin: we haven't built a more sophisticated system for flagging spam yet. generally we try to rely on room admins to sort it out, but obviously they aren't there all the time and trying to figure out an automated way to do this that can't be "gamed" is pretty tricky.
[2017-03-05 10:47:52] <mydigitalself> i've just added both you and@pdurbinas admins in this room, as you've both been long term participants here and i trust you both
[2017-03-05 10:49:36] <mydigitalself> the little blue lines are somewhat legacy to be honest, they are github admins - so won't include all people who've been manually added as admins
[2017-03-05 12:43:30] <pdurbin> mydigitalself: thanks, that's very nice of you. However, I probably won't be deleting any messages because I connect through the IRC gateway and I can't imagine that deleting messages from there is supported.
[2017-03-05 12:43:57] <pdurbin> Now I'm curious if there's any tracking of who deleted the message and if it can be restored.
[2017-03-05 13:40:00] <grahamperrin> @mydigitalself similarly, thanks. It's an unexpected privilege, if ever I'm in doubt about how to proceed (particularly in cases of conflict) I'll defer to other admins for advice.https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/developers?at=58b7145af1a33b6275681da4 no longer highlights anything, so I assume that the handful of offences around that point are already deleted.
[2017-03-05 15:05:07] <pdurbin> That's good. Thanks. I'd highlight your name but I'm using the IRC gateway and I can't "tab complete" your nick/username, Graham. I'm not sure why.
[2017-03-06 08:18:48] <grahamperrin> … accident … phone …@PhilPotter no problem. With an Android device I found that neither the application, nor the mobile web interface (in Firefox on that device) can delete in that situation. If you like, subscribe to gitterHQ/gitter#649
[2017-03-06 17:30:20] <luoXH2016> Hi, i'm new to the community. Don't know how to compiler the Gitterr app for openSuse, there's only two bash scripts for linux
[2017-03-06 17:32:08] <luoXH2016> Can I get some help for compile/install Gitter for Linux system other than debian/ubuntu
[2017-03-06 18:35:21] <ta2-1> Hi, I get 404 error when I'm trying to open any existing channel link which needs authorization but I'm logged out. Is there any chance to get more plausible result?
[2017-03-06 19:03:00] <lydatech> is there a way to turn off the people and activity sidebars in the browser?
[2017-03-06 19:55:53] <grahamperrin> lydatech: I can think only of changing the user-agent string, for the browser to behave as if it's a mobile browser. Too extreme?
[2017-03-06 19:57:21] <grahamperrin> file:///home/grahamperrin/Pictures/Firefox as Firefox mobile.png
[2017-03-06 19:58:10] <grahamperrin> Downside: no drop of files.
[2017-03-06 19:58:30] <lydatech> grahamperrin: yeah I just deleted the right-toolbar node
[2017-03-06 19:59:04] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-06 20:15:04] <lydatech> grahamperrin: I dont know why you screen shotted that but i fixed the issue by deleting the node
[2017-03-06 20:20:32] <grahamperrin> Cool. The shot was taken before I read about the node.
[2017-03-06 20:26:36] <lydatech> grahamperrin: 
[2017-03-08 08:18:30] <uk0> How do I use event stream like "org.wso2.apimgt.statistics.execution.time" to get information relating to api invocation,Is there any example?
[2017-03-08 08:18:51] <uk0> wso2 room link
[2017-03-08 08:46:12] <mydigitalself> lydatech: icon in the bottom right corner will collapse the people/activity. you'll still see some people, but it's probably a better solution than deleting nodes, which may result in unexpected javascript issues.
[2017-03-08 08:46:43] <uk0> mydigitalself: ni you bing ba
[2017-03-08 08:47:47] <OndrejMarsalek> Hi everyone, I am having a problem for which I did not find documentation or a solution.
[2017-03-08 08:47:50] <mydigitalself> ta2-1: this is exactly how GitHub deal with unauthorised; we also don't believe it's ideal, but it's an established convention on GitHub and we didn't want to contradict people's expectation of it
[2017-03-08 08:48:18] <mydigitalself> zmatsh: ?
[2017-03-08 08:48:28] <OndrejMarsalek> When I click on one of my organizations, I get a message that the room does not exist yet and a button to create it, but it does nothing, the pop up just stays there.
[2017-03-08 08:48:36] <OndrejMarsalek> Other organizations work as expected.
[2017-03-08 08:50:30] <uk0> mydigitalself: hello
[2017-03-08 08:50:48] <uk0> mydigitalself: How do I use event stream like "org.wso2.apimgt.statistics.execution.time" to get information relating to api invocation,Is there any example?
[2017-03-08 08:50:54] <mydigitalself> OndrejMarsalek: do you see anything in your javascript console when you click that?
[2017-03-08 08:51:19] <mydigitalself> zmatsh: did you just join this room?
[2017-03-08 08:51:30] <uk0> yes
[2017-03-08 08:51:42] <mydigitalself> did you see this
[2017-03-08 08:51:57] <uk0> no
[2017-03-08 08:51:57] <mydigitalself>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-08 08:52:17] <uk0> no see
[2017-03-08 08:52:51] <mydigitalself> right. this room isn't for general software development questions. it's for feedback/bugs and questions about Gitter
[2017-03-08 08:53:01] <OndrejMarsalek> @mydigitalself good suggestion, this is what I get: [<-CODE->] But I am not sure what to make of it.
[2017-03-08 08:53:09] <mydigitalself> hmmm
[2017-03-08 08:54:37] <mydigitalself> org rooms are pretty much deprecated - so perhaps that's a valid bug. if you want to create a community for a new org, click on the+icon in the bottom left and go through the Create Community flow. by default it will create a public room, you can then add a private room just for people in the org.
[2017-03-08 08:55:42] <OndrejMarsalek> OK, but for other orgs when I click on the I get to an overview of rooms for that org, plus there is a Home
[2017-03-08 08:55:56] <OndrejMarsalek> but this one org fails like this
[2017-03-08 08:56:12] <OndrejMarsalek> should I create a community using the name of the org?
[2017-03-08 08:56:15] <mydigitalself> yeah, i think it sounds like a bug and it shouldn't be showing in that list unless there's a community created for it
[2017-03-08 08:56:37] <mydigitalself> yeah, if you click on the create community icon, then choose your Org from the list to create a gitter community for that org
[2017-03-08 08:57:09] <OndrejMarsalek> This address is not availableis what I get
[2017-03-08 08:58:01] <OndrejMarsalek> when I go to the URL directly, it actually works, at [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-08 08:58:26] <OndrejMarsalek> it is just the link under "YOUR ORGANISATIONS" that's having trouble
[2017-03-08 08:59:44] <OndrejMarsalek> Although when I go through the link, the "Home" room does not work and going directly to the URL at [<-LINK->] gives a 404
[2017-03-08 09:00:15] <OndrejMarsalek> So I am a little lost.
[2017-03-08 09:00:22] <mydigitalself> hmmm
[2017-03-08 09:00:27] <mydigitalself> something is indeed fishy there
[2017-03-08 09:00:47] <mydigitalself> was the org renamed or anything like that?
[2017-03-08 09:00:49] <OndrejMarsalek> We don't have any content yet, I'd be happy to nuke everything
[2017-03-08 09:00:58] <OndrejMarsalek> it was not, as far as I know
[2017-03-08 09:01:43] <mydigitalself> OndrejMarsalek: would you mind explaining everything in an issue in [<-LINK->] and will get someone to take a look
[2017-03-08 09:01:49] <OndrejMarsalek> I did delete a room at one point because I wanted to start over after some tests, but I am not sure which room it was, it was a bit confusing at that point
[2017-03-08 09:01:57] <OndrejMarsalek> sure, can do
[2017-03-08 09:19:32] <OndrejMarsalek> done: [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-03-08 15:27:41] <ShawnTalbert> So, what ever happened to thetopicsfeature announced like 6 months ago?
[2017-03-08 15:27:55] <ShawnTalbert>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-08 15:28:30] <ShawnTalbert> All I see is the same single-thread-confusion in busy rooms :(
[2017-03-08 15:42:08] <ShawnTalbert> Is this where we discuss gitter.next ?
[2017-03-08 15:42:18] <ShawnTalbert> I have a fun bug where my left nav duplicates itself
[2017-03-08 15:44:15] <mydigitalself> Topics have been enabled for a while, it's a separate section per community. if you visit [<-LINK->] you should see them in the list there
[2017-03-08 15:44:54] <ShawnTalbert> thanks Mike, is it something that should be enabled for all communities?
[2017-03-08 15:45:29] <mydigitalself> they are still in beta, so only enabled for a select communities
[2017-03-08 15:46:14] <mydigitalself> what are the steps to reproduce your left nav and what os/browser combo?
[2017-03-08 23:41:19] <raine> any idea how to format an explicit empty line in messages?

[2017-03-08 23:42:05] <raine> foobar
[2017-03-08 23:42:10] <raine> there should be empty line between

[2017-03-08 23:42:42] <InternetUnexplorer> Oh, you're right.
[2017-03-08 23:43:25] <raine>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-08 23:43:34] <raine> i'm trying to format this into having an empty line before the header
[2017-03-08 23:45:06] <raine> it's not a big deal, but got me wondering
[2017-03-09 04:03:50] <typoinadvance> guys i am sorry for interrupting. i wanna ask something.. Well.. I did not pay attention to gas fee when sending asset to a contract.. and it is set 32671 gas... it had been like 30 minutes and not yet process by miners.. i am very worried if it would stuck forever on the blockchain... can someone plis help me. what should i do? or i just have to wait T_T . ty in advance.
[2017-03-09 04:58:46] <grahamperrin> gitter gas, assets, contracts, miners, blocks and chains? If not related to the gitter service, then please visit [<-LINK->] to find a suitable room. Thanks.
[2017-03-09 05:03:11] <grahamperrin> Hmm. To there and back causes a gitter gas leak:

[2017-03-09 07:26:23] <sebdeckers> Hi, is there a way to create private rooms? it's mentioned on the Billing page and I could swear I used them in the past but now just can't find a way to do it.
[2017-03-09 07:39:22] <sebdeckers> Oh never mind, found the way to do it from theAdd A Roombutton. Wasn't clear to me from the new community creation workflow.
[2017-03-09 13:15:43] <pixxx> Hi, I'm not sure whether I can Github questions here or is this only for Gitter? And if so is there a room for Github questions?
[2017-03-09 13:18:31] <pixxx> And I do have one Gitter question as well, when I accidently join a private conversation how to I end it, the only option seems to be hide, but that doesn't seem to remove me from the room or does it?
[2017-03-09 15:38:01] <InternetUnexplorer> pixxx: You can't reallyleavea private conversation, you can only hide it.
[2017-03-09 15:40:07] <InternetUnexplorer> Also, to answer your first question, this room is forgitter questions only, GitHub/git questions are better off in gitterHQ/developers.
[2017-03-09 19:46:13] <BombaShack> Sorry guys just testing
[2017-03-09 20:55:06] <grahamperrin> BombaShack:  [<-LINK->]  sandbox is better for testing.

[2017-03-10 14:53:59] <mydigitalself> for free accounts, we don't have a standard turn around time and our team is really small, so it's really just a case of finding time to get through all of the requests we get alongside maintaining and running gitter.

[2017-03-11 01:12:56] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @KennethBruen_twitterYour name reflects your name on Twitter. You can't get rid of the_twittersuffix
[2017-03-11 01:13:56] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @paulo-raoniTriple backticks ``` on separate lines above and below your code
[2017-03-11 01:14:50] <paulo-raoni> just a little test: [<-CODE->] 
[2017-03-11 01:15:01] <paulo-raoni> oowww right.. :D
[2017-03-11 01:15:08] <paulo-raoni> thanks Eric!
[2017-03-11 01:16:20] <cbj4074> Well, that's not the whole story.@KennethBruen_twitter, you can log in with GitHub instead and you won't have that_twittersuffix.
[2017-03-11 06:04:23] <KennethBruen_twitter> MadLittleMods: I changed my name on Twitter since then
[2017-03-11 09:58:57] <mydigitalself> KennethBruen_twitter: have you tried signing out and then back in again?
[2017-03-11 13:19:40] <KennethBruen_twitter> Yes, I tried

[2017-03-11 13:26:20] <nicolas33> Any idea?

[2017-03-11 13:59:47] <mydigitalself> KennethBruen_twitter: not sure why it wasn't updating, perhaps the twitter connector isn't synching properly. i've manually fixed both your display name and avatar
[2017-03-11 13:59:52] <nicolas33> Thank you much!
[2017-03-11 18:01:22] <sdogruyol> I moved my repo from my personal account to an organization however it's still not updated in Gitter. What can i do?

[2017-03-11 20:07:18] <tommygebru> How long does it take for an avatar change on gitter?the image along the messages changes immediately, but the image next to the settings in the navigation does not change so it looks like i have 2 or maybe even 3 images that represent my profile.

[2017-03-12 23:26:46] <p3lim> How do I create a room pointing to a private repository to a user, not an org?
[2017-03-12 23:28:44] <p3lim> The two ways I've seen where I can create a room are both broken from my POV, the one under "All Conversations" on the left where I click "Add a room" forces me to use a community, and if I do not, selecting a room name based on my repos on GitHub just sends the background into a 404 and the create button stops working.
[2017-03-12 23:29:00] <p3lim> That was this prompt: [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-12 23:29:37] <p3lim> The second one, from [<-LINK->] is more stable, but I can't create a private room there.
[2017-03-12 23:30:16] <p3lim> Also, I seem to be completely unable to delete communities, right now I've been testing this out and I've got 11 empty communities in my list I'd like to remove
[2017-03-12 23:31:10] <MadLittleMods> p3lim: You need to create ap3limcommunity first. Then select it in the create room modal (make sure you allow private repo access under your user dropdown in the top-right)
[2017-03-12 23:32:15] <p3lim> Alright, that solves it
[2017-03-12 23:32:50] <p3lim> Quite unintuitive that when selecing a repo of mine from that list doesn't give me the option, rather sends the whole modal into a 404
[2017-03-12 23:33:01] <p3lim> How do I delete communities though?
[2017-03-12 23:33:36] <MadLittleMods> @p3lim Where are you selecting a repo that gives you a 404? (reproduction steps)You can't delete communties yet. I can remove them if you give me the names
[2017-03-12 23:33:59] <p3lim> In that window I took a screenshot of
[2017-03-12 23:34:42] <p3lim> Without selecting a community, typing the start of my repo under "Room name" and clicking on it sends the background of that popup into a 404 and breaks the create button
[2017-03-12 23:35:08] <p3lim> What I would expect is the option to create  a community under my username and it'd just work
[2017-03-12 23:35:21] <p3lim> Or fill it in if it already existed
[2017-03-12 23:37:26] <p3lim> Anyways, thanks for the help :)
[2017-03-12 23:37:54] <MadLittleMods> p3lim: Create an issue [<-LINK->] about the create room modal giving a 404 when selecting a repo without a community selected and your expectations. Provide the screenshots and reproduction steps
[2017-03-12 23:38:24] <p3lim> Alright
[2017-03-12 23:38:41] <p3lim> Tomorrow, bed time now :]
[2017-03-12 23:47:40] <t0cc> Hi, it seems to me using the Gitter->IRC proxy doesn't transmit the full /who (nicks) list to the IRC client. Is this a known limitation?
[2017-03-12 23:48:48] <MadLittleMods> @t0cc Yes, gitterHQ/irc-bridge#52Feel free to create a PR for the trickle idea in that  issue
[2017-03-12 23:48:50] <t0cc> I get only 31 nicks shown on channel login
[2017-03-13 00:00:45] <t0cc> MadLittleMods: well, that's unfortunate. Especially, because I'm a member of FCC channel and the web solution is very distracting to me personally. Mmm... thinking
[2017-03-13 00:16:06] <t0cc> I guess, I will look into a client trickle solution first. Anyway, thanks.
[2017-03-13 00:34:39] <Lorin_twitter> How do I nuke my account
[2017-03-13 02:50:35] <MadLittleMods> Lorin_twitter: You can't do it yourself. I can deleteLorin_twitter, if you reply to confirm
[2017-03-13 09:02:18] <SchoolforDesign> hello
[2017-03-13 10:06:33] <lolmaus> I've got trouble with Gitter's email notifications. For a long time, I wasn't receiving any email notifications at all, but now Gitter sends me occasional notifications, seemingly randomly. And the few messages displayed in every email do not even contain any mentions.I would like to configure most channels to send me email notifications for personal or collective mentions. How do I do that?And of course, when I'm mentioned, I want to see that particular message in the email, even when there are lots of other unread messages.
[2017-03-13 10:49:32] <hellobama> MadLittleMods: Thanks for the support with my repo. ;)
[2017-03-13 11:50:27] <lolmaus> My Notifications settings for this channel are "Notify me of mentions and announcements". Yet I've just received an email notification containing this previous message! 
[2017-03-13 15:29:35] <SimonDarksideJ_twitter> Hi All
[2017-03-13 15:30:00] <SimonDarksideJ_twitter> Quick Gitter Q, is there a way to change your displayname?  Mine seems to have added "_twitter" to mine and I don't like it :D
[2017-03-13 15:30:38] <SimonDarksideJ_twitter> Can't seem to find a profile or acount page anywhere to update/manage it
[2017-03-13 15:30:42] <Electronic-Repository> anyone using gitter app 64 bit on linux?
[2017-03-13 15:40:13] <cbj4074> SimonDarksideJ_twitter: Short answer: no. But if you log in with GitHub the suffix won't be displayed.
[2017-03-13 15:42:31] <SimonDarksideJ_twitter> Fair enough, thanks
[2017-03-13 16:29:08] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @kyles-repositoryWhat is your actual question?
[2017-03-13 16:32:38] <MadLittleMods>  March 13, 2017 5:06 AM @lolmaus Emails weren't going out while we tried to migrate services, gitterHQ/gitter#1570Email notifications are connected to the unread count, not your "desktop" notification setting. See this issue for decoupling, gitterHQ/gitter#1205
[2017-03-13 16:34:43] <Electronic-Repository> MadLittleMod: my actual question is "is anyone using gitter app 64 bit on linux?", but I'm looking for responses from anyone using it to say yes.
[2017-03-13 16:34:52] <lolmaus> MadLittleMods: Does that issue contain a solution or only the description of the problem?
[2017-03-13 16:35:49] <Electronic-Repository> my inner demon concious says it was rude for me to reply like i did to you. I have a very sensitive inner demon concious.
[2017-03-13 16:35:55] <MadLittleMods> lolmaus: To get closest to your desired effect of email notifications, you need to turn your notification setting to "Mute"
[2017-03-13 16:36:06] <Electronic-Repository> so im sorry if that seemed rude
[2017-03-13 16:36:18] <MadLittleMods> kyles-repository: What happens if people say yes?
[2017-03-13 16:36:25] <Electronic-Repository> Nothing
[2017-03-13 16:36:57] <lolmaus> MadLittleMods: This issue is gonna be one year old in a few weeks. 
[2017-03-13 16:37:51] <Electronic-Repository> The world might explode!
[2017-03-13 16:38:41] <Electronic-Repository> At the momeny 0 yes, so no exploding earth, neither do I take your soul.
[2017-03-13 20:07:17] <SISheogorath> >.>Has anyone realized that "Linux" is not only ubuntu? Because it's very annoying to get an.deb-file while you're  on a non-debian-based distribution

[2017-03-13 20:27:30] <demhydraz> <3
[2017-03-13 20:27:39] <demhydraz> Can you ban them or something? I don't think it's going to stop
[2017-03-13 20:27:46] <MadLittleMods> demhydraz: Already done
[2017-03-13 20:28:00] <demhydraz> Should have guessed
[2017-03-13 20:28:03] <demhydraz> you're awesome 
[2017-03-13 20:28:05] <viluon> MadLittleMods: You guys should seriously include a way of reporting people in the UI (for non-admins). Also, these spams are pretty easy to test for imo - something like a check for more than 15 mentions in a message or, I don't know, spamming 200 newlines per minute - silencing the user for a set amount of time with a warning visible just to him/her should do the trick..
[2017-03-13 20:28:12] <viluon> Thanks for the quick response
[2017-03-13 20:28:25] <MadLittleMods> viluon: We have checks in place, not sure why it didn't get triggered in this case
[2017-03-13 20:28:56] <viluon> Good to hear, is the spam-checking code source-available?
[2017-03-13 20:29:26] <MadLittleMods> viluon: nope and I'd prefer to keep it vague for now
[2017-03-13 20:30:19] <viluon> Yeah of course, I was asking to see if he couldn't have possibly intentionally abused a bug or an edge case in the checks themselves
[2017-03-13 20:34:46] <cbj4074> It seems like having a way for users to report messages would be the most effective mechanism possible. If somebody's messages are reported X times in Y minutes by Z different users, insta-ban. It seems unlikely that users will "gang-up" on someone undeserving out of malice.

[2017-03-13 20:36:07] <cbj4074>  Perfect!
[2017-03-13 23:02:50] <InternetUnexplorer> MadLittleMods: when someone is banned, why do all of their messages remain? They're marked as deleted, sure, but you still have a thousand messages that are marked as deleted :/
[2017-03-13 23:07:39] <MadLittleMods> InternetUnexplorer: The script clears out thetextandhtmlinstead of deleting the message outright because it caused stuck unreads. [<-LINK->] when we added the delete action for admins and I can update the util  script to actually delete messages

Notify when you're mentioned
Notify on @/all announcementsI am getting emails all day saying I have unread messages. These are not mentions or all announcements. Is this the expected behavior? Is there any way I can only get emails if someone mentions me or makes an all announcement?
[2017-03-14 21:05:41] <cbj4074> geek1011: Hah! Interesting. Surprised some miscreant hasn't abused that.

[2017-03-15 06:41:26] <Atry> MadLittleMods: Is sub-room an old feature inaccessible from current version of Gitter?

[2017-03-15 17:16:34] <kbrock> opensourcing a project is not trivial. Think my project took a year(?) to touch up so it could be opensourced

[2017-03-15 17:17:15] <suprememoocow> kbrock: no it's not. It will definitely take a lot of effort and will probably happen in stages.
[2017-03-15 17:17:22] <suprememoocow> I'm really looking forward to it though
[2017-03-15 17:17:25] <kbrock> you opensourcing history too?

[2017-03-15 17:17:54] <kbrock> in the end, we lost history for others
[2017-03-15 17:18:05] <kbrock> but added the--followfor our own use of git blame
[2017-03-15 17:18:31] <kbrock> too many startup late nights -> passwords sneak into the repo and stuff
[2017-03-15 17:22:54] <kbrock> anyway - congrats all. very cool stuff
[2017-03-15 17:24:59] <omame> thanks 
[2017-03-15 17:30:49] <suprememoocow> kbrock: did you ever look at BFG?
[2017-03-15 17:31:33] <suprememoocow>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-15 17:31:39] <8BIT_twitter> Just stopping in and saying CONGRATS!   
[2017-03-15 17:31:56] <suprememoocow> Thanks@8BIT_twitter:)
[2017-03-15 17:31:57] <kbrock> whoa
[2017-03-15 17:32:25] <kbrock> suprememoocow: that is good stuff. I think I remember hearing a blog cast from the author.
[2017-03-15 17:32:51] <volksman> So does this mean that if I run my own GitLab server I can have a private room for each of my repos to talk to developers on that repo?
[2017-03-15 17:32:54] <EdenSG> huge move, congrats everyone!
[2017-03-15 17:33:19] <InternetUnexplorer> As others have already said, congratulations@suprememoocow@MadLittleMods@mydigitalself@cutandpastey! (and anyone else if I forgot, sorry)
[2017-03-15 17:33:40] <kbrock> suprememoocow: yea, we also had to delete gems (rails 1.0 suggested checking in the binaries) and other stuff
[2017-03-15 17:34:50] <suprememoocow> Yeah, that makes things a lot trickier :-/
[2017-03-15 17:35:05] <suprememoocow> InternetUnexplorer: thank you kindly :)
[2017-03-15 17:37:08] <AshleyGrant> mydigitalself: 
[2017-03-15 17:38:25] <AshleyGrant> Does this acquisition mean properly sorted search results might actually happen? Bc the unordered search results basically kills any chance of Gitter being a decent archive for open source frameworks. So much knowledge is getting lost.
[2017-03-15 17:38:53] <AshleyGrant> The feature request has been open for at least two years now.
[2017-03-15 17:39:41] <MadLittleMods> AshleyGrant: Not directly :P Feel free to make a MR when we open source [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-03-15 17:40:21] <abhiramr> Congratulations, good fellas of Gitter :)
[2017-03-15 17:41:02] <jeffgamedev> Yeah way to go guys! Just started using gitter im a few months ago and loving it, congrats on the move
[2017-03-15 17:41:31] <MadLittleMods> Thanks@abhiii5459@jeffol
[2017-03-15 17:42:26] <nicolas33> Congratulations! Long life to Gitter and Gitlab! ,-)
[2017-03-15 17:42:26] <abhiramr>  
[2017-03-15 17:43:30] <AshleyGrant> How exactly is chronological search sorting not a five minute change? I'm sorry, but "Do
[2017-03-15 17:44:02] <AshleyGrant> "Do it yourself" is a terrible response to something so basic.
[2017-03-15 17:44:24] <DeerSpotter> So how do i get kicked from this room?
[2017-03-15 17:45:01] <darshanime> Wow, big news! Open source!
[2017-03-15 17:45:02] <DeerSpotter> Challenge accepted? Admins?
[2017-03-15 17:45:15] <DeerSpotter> :P
[2017-03-15 17:45:23] <DeerSpotter> 
[2017-03-15 17:45:31] <darshanime> Can someone please tell, what language? What tech stack?
[2017-03-15 17:45:52] <DeerSpotter> YOURE      
[2017-03-15 17:46:09] <DeerSpotter> i think they copied the code from mattermost
[2017-03-15 17:47:00] <darshanime> Zulip would die now!
[2017-03-15 17:47:09] <samtuke_twitter> This looks simpler than mattermost. Think I'll stick with that.
[2017-03-15 17:47:09] <darshanime>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-15 17:47:27] <darshanime> They don't exist. 
[2017-03-15 17:48:52] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @darshanimeSee [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-15 17:50:53] <darshanime> The backend is Java I suppose?
[2017-03-15 17:51:02] <MadLittleMods> darshanime: All Node.js
[2017-03-15 17:51:39] <gitleet> What does gitter use websockets wise? like is it a open source javascript lib?
[2017-03-15 17:52:19] <darshanime> Container orchestration is docker compose. One would have thought they would have something more robust
[2017-03-15 17:52:22] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @AshleyGrantDefinitely a sticky point we want to address and has been touched before but nothing solid enough to ship and other things have been prioritized above.
[2017-03-15 17:53:28] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @gitleetWe use [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-15 17:54:10] <suprememoocow> gitleet: Halley for the client and [<-LINK->] for the server. They both talk Bayeux protocol.
[2017-03-15 17:54:57] <gitleet> i want to learn how to build a scalable app like this, I mean understand what components are involved.
[2017-03-15 17:55:21] <darshanime> How is it deployed? Docker containers? How are the containers orchestrated?
[2017-03-15 17:55:35] <darshanime> ping@suprememoocow@MadLittleMods
[2017-03-15 17:57:26] <rhutchison> gitlab :/
[2017-03-15 17:58:11] <dhcodes> Are there any plans for the API to allow one to send private messages via api?
[2017-03-15 17:58:42] <gitleet> suprememoocow: hmm, halley is a fork of faye though?
[2017-03-15 17:58:47] <dhcodes> I understand that with the new acquisition and the move to fully open-source, one could probably write this functionality but I didn't know if it was already in the works
[2017-03-15 17:59:25] <suprememoocow> darshanime: the production application runs straight on EC2 instances right now. Our development environment uses Docker compose so it's fairly easy to get running on any box that can run docker machine.
[2017-03-15 17:59:27] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @dhcodesYou can send a message in a one to one just like any other room, see [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-15 17:59:41] <suprememoocow> If you don't like docker, you can also run it without docker on your dev instance
[2017-03-15 18:00:08] <dhcodes> okay, thanks@MadLittleModsi'll check it out
[2017-03-15 18:00:17] <gitleet> oh, this will be O/S soonish? wow that will be cool!
[2017-03-15 18:00:18] <suprememoocow> @gitleetit is a fork, but it doesn't share that much code any more
[2017-03-15 18:00:32] <suprememoocow> gitleet: we're aiming for June.
[2017-03-15 18:00:59] <gitleet> so halley runs on the browser not server, and faye is the actually server pub/sub sending out the messages etc.
[2017-03-15 18:01:47] <suprememoocow> Halley is the bayeux client. It runs in nodejs on the server and in browsers too. Faye is the server component of Bayeux. We're running a fork of Faye, but it's much, much closer to the original code than the client is
[2017-03-15 18:02:21] <darshanime> Where do you use Java? I see it on your stack
[2017-03-15 18:03:13] <Jolg42_twitter> Just saw the news about Gitter / GitLab  Keep up the good work!
[2017-03-15 18:03:28] <suprememoocow> Thanks@Jolg42_twitter:)
[2017-03-15 18:03:59] <suprememoocow> darshanime: the only thing we're using Java for at the moment on the server is neo4j
[2017-03-15 18:04:19] <suprememoocow> We also use the Java language for the android application, but not JVM as such.
[2017-03-15 18:04:53] <darshanime> That's awesome!
[2017-03-15 18:04:55] <suprememoocow> Oh and Elasticsearch of course :)
[2017-03-15 18:05:23] <darshanime> I am just curious, how does on go about opensourcing a project of this size?
[2017-03-15 18:05:44] <darshanime> Will you traverse the .git and remove keys/tokens etc
[2017-03-15 18:05:54] <gitleet> is the frontend react or something?
[2017-03-15 18:06:16] <darshanime> Or will the history be wiped out?
[2017-03-15 18:06:20] <InternetUnexplorer> Will you traverse the .git and remove keys/tokens etcWe have a little bit of work to do to remove some internal configuration and operating parameters from the Gitter source code. We expect to have this completed and to move the code over to GitLab.com no later than June 2017.@darshanime
[2017-03-15 18:06:46] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @gitleetMost of the frontend is Backbone and Marionette. We use React for topics, [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-15 18:07:57] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @darshanime@suprememoocowposted a cool tool earlier    [<-LINK->] . We aim to keep the history
[2017-03-15 18:08:24] <suprememoocow> darshanime: All the secrets, except one that I know of are kept in a single file. We will probably 1) Change the secrets 2) Rewrite the history of that file.
[2017-03-15 18:09:16] <gitleet> MadLittleMods: I wonder if intercom uses faye also
[2017-03-15 18:09:49] <darshanime> Also, one more thing. Gitter logs to ELK stack I presume? Will that be removed after O/S or it will be there, but everyone will have access to the logs
[2017-03-15 18:11:07] <Yardanico> What's the language Gitter is written in?
[2017-03-15 18:11:22] <gitleet> nodejs
[2017-03-15 18:11:28] <Yardanico> ah, thanks
[2017-03-15 18:12:13] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @TiberiumPYSee [<-LINK->] for more info
[2017-03-15 18:13:01] <Yardanico> hmm
[2017-03-15 18:13:04] <Yardanico> very nice website
[2017-03-15 18:16:10] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @darshanimeWe log to multiple places, kibana, mixpanel, datadog - I assume it will still be there, just dependent on the config whether the instance utilizes them

[2017-03-15 18:17:28] <LukyVj> Also
[2017-03-15 18:17:30] <LukyVj> in that email
[2017-03-15 18:17:38] <LukyVj> there is a typo in the founders email

[2017-03-15 18:18:08] <LukyVj> I believe it should befounders@gitter.iminsteat of@giter.im
[2017-03-15 18:18:38] <MadLittleMods> Thanks for typo shout@LukyVj, I'll look into it.
[2017-03-15 18:18:56] <InternetUnexplorer> 
[2017-03-15 18:19:09] <LukyVj> thank you internetUexplorer
[2017-03-15 18:19:09] <InternetUnexplorer> Above is an artist's rendering with the typo fixed,@MadLittleMods.These changes would obviously be rolled out site-wide
[2017-03-15 18:19:20] <LukyVj> But still think there is typo

[2017-03-15 18:26:35] <gitleet> nice!
[2017-03-15 18:32:41] <asmeurer> congratulations you guys. Gitter has had a huge impact on our community (sympy/sympy)
[2017-03-15 18:34:00] <MadLittleMods> Thanks@asmeurer
[2017-03-15 18:34:12] <mhinz> Well done, dear Gitter team. 
[2017-03-15 18:38:00] <MadLittleMods> mhinz:  
[2017-03-15 18:39:52] <demhydraz>  to everyone?
[2017-03-15 18:40:16] <MadLittleMods> demhydraz: Lunch time for me ;) 
[2017-03-15 18:40:36] <demhydraz> I have pizza for breakfast, I have pizza for lunch, I have pizza for dinner..
[2017-03-15 18:40:42] <demhydraz> Sounds like you need more pizza in your life :P
[2017-03-15 18:43:06] <timruffles> Congrats Gitter :) !
[2017-03-15 19:21:12] <nafg> darshanime: what's not robust about docker-compose? You know it can be used with docker swarm, right?
[2017-03-15 19:22:13] <demhydraz> 
[2017-03-15 19:22:17] <demhydraz> i seem to be getting this very often
[2017-03-15 19:22:41] <listochkin> @MadLittleMods @mydigitalself and othersHuge Congrats to You All!We're so happy we choose Gitter many years ago. Thank you so much!
[2017-03-15 19:23:22] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @demhydrazNeo4j is burning up which powers the suggestions. That notification indicates the suggestion endpoint 504'd. Wasn't really intended for it to do that though
[2017-03-15 19:23:43] <demhydraz> ah
[2017-03-15 19:24:36] <MadLittleMods> Thanks@listochkin
[2017-03-15 19:37:28] <anapsix_twitter> bravo Gitlab, congrats Gitter!high fives all around!
[2017-03-15 19:38:43] <pr-yemibedu> very cool. time to sign up for some private gitlab repos.
[2017-03-15 19:44:36] <MadLittleMods> anapsix_twitter:  
[2017-03-15 19:50:32] <Odonno> Wow, such a great news
[2017-03-15 19:53:00] <Odonno> I have some questions : will you pursue your work on the platform after the open source model? Will the product (gitter) still look the same, I mean to be able to join any public room in the world?
[2017-03-15 19:53:59] <grahamperrin> top banana
[2017-03-15 19:56:24] <grahamperrin> as was said twenty-something years ago. No idea of the origin but it indubitably signifies that thingsaretop banana.
[2017-03-15 19:56:43] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @OdonnoThe product will be the same. More time will probably be spent managing and reviewing community contributions over development though
[2017-03-15 19:57:44] <Odonno> thanks
[2017-03-15 20:53:03] <jb510> Is it presently possible to create a room based on a GitLab repo?  (I see a GitLab integration for rooms, but don't think that provides for that)
[2017-03-15 20:53:39] <MadLittleMods> jb510: Not possible yet, related [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-03-15 20:55:25] <jb510> MadLittleMods: ty, follow up, there is still no way to create a room without a repo IIRC?
[2017-03-15 20:56:12] <MadLittleMods> jb510: You can create a room without a repo associated (it's been that way for a looooong time)
[2017-03-15 20:58:23] <jb510> TY...  just figured it out.. I looked long ago and couldn't figure it out... but looking again I managed to.  I think I thought you couldn't because the "add a room" button didn't show up when inside and organization.
[2017-03-15 21:02:46] <NoahAndrews> It's not often you see an acquisition that results in the open sourcing of the acquired product, continued maintenance of that product,andall functionality made free. As long as you guys keep your promises  continuing to support GitHub, which I don't doubt
[2017-03-15 21:04:11] <NoahAndrews> Whoops. Anyway, this is really exciting. Congrats to all involved, and thanks for an innovative product!
[2017-03-15 21:08:19] <MadLittleMods> Thanks@NoahAndrews
[2017-03-15 22:19:52] <samccone> congrats@mydigitalselfand team on the success
[2017-03-15 23:04:34] <nicholas-itpedia> It IS a very good thing that Gitter was bought by Gitlab. Here is Gitlab's blog announcement: [<-LINK->] Concerned about an open source focused tool being purchased by a larger company? Gitlab CE is open source too. We have been using Gitlab Community Edition since 2013 and have been happy every month with the new features and fixes. Here is Gitlab's strategy: [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-15 23:57:35] <pdurbin> Congrats on the acquisition. "we will be open sourcing all of the Gitter" is awesome.
[2017-03-16 03:15:19] <kirkcoco> cool
[2017-03-16 03:35:26] <lc-soft> gitter will open source ?
[2017-03-16 03:36:19] <NoahAndrews> Yep, it's in the official announcement!
[2017-03-16 03:36:25] <NoahAndrews> June timeframe
[2017-03-16 03:36:47] <NoahAndrews> So , the server, everything
[2017-03-16 03:36:58] <NoahAndrews> All clients*
[2017-03-16 05:36:58] <gozonjoedaimar> guys, how can i view my recent mentions?

[2017-03-16 07:18:57] <Modestiny> hello guys  is this a good platform for our code works?
[2017-03-16 07:20:21] <Modestiny> why so little guys chatting  in this room?
[2017-03-16 07:21:04] <MadLittleMods> Modestiny: It's unclear what you are asking. We welcome your project to Gitter. I just chatted 5 minutes ago 
[2017-03-16 07:24:45] <Modestiny> MadLittleMods: but you can see that there are not so many records refreshing frequently
[2017-03-16 07:25:20] <MadLittleMods> Modestiny: It's very very early in the morning for most users. I wouldn't expect this chat to flow super fast in 5 minutes on a normal day either
[2017-03-16 07:27:03] <Modestiny> MadLittleMods: early?  morning ?where are you from?
[2017-03-16 07:27:37] <MadLittleMods> Modestiny: 2:27am in Minnesota, USA. Also 7:27am in Europe
[2017-03-16 07:29:46] <Modestiny> @MadLittleModsok,guys  ,in my country ?it's about 3.30pm
[2017-03-16 07:32:27] <Modestiny> MadLittleMods: Are you a code worker?
[2017-03-16 07:33:04] <MadLittleMods> Modestiny: Yes, I work at GitLab/Gitter
[2017-03-16 07:36:08] <Modestiny> MadLittleMods: i am a web front-end  developmement engineer
[2017-03-16 08:41:40] <technokob_twitter> Hello to all. New to Gitter and thinking about using it primarily as a tool for community building around my product. Is this an acceptable use of this platform? Obviously, I'm thinking paid for private community/chat rooms. Is theresuch a thing and where could I learn more? Looked around and I could not find the information I was looking for.
[2017-03-16 09:09:56] <Osatuore> Hello everyone. I am Oladayo from Nigeria. I am new to programming. I decided to learn programming so that I can bring my imaginations and dreams to life. I also want to contribute to the development of females in my country and Africa as a whole, in the area of technology.
[2017-03-16 09:19:41] <grahamperrin> Osatuore: and all other newcomers to the lobby: [<-LINK->]  first familiarise yourselves with the available rooms, then please  join those that will suit your discussions.
[2017-03-16 09:20:52] <grahamperrin> technokob_twitter: try [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-16 09:27:22] <Osatuore> grahamperrin: thank you.
[2017-03-16 14:08:13] <InternetUnexplorer> grahamperrin: @cbj4074@MadLittleModsAn idea, if you don't mind: you should start deleting messages like those without warning. They've found the room, ignored the message in bold and clicked "I understand" anyway. However good their intentions may be, these messages don't belong here and distract from those trying to ask actual support questions.
[2017-03-16 14:10:54] <cbj4074> Trust me, if I had any authority, I'd blow them away on sight. :D
[2017-03-16 14:20:27] <InternetUnexplorer> cbj4074: Huh, thought you were made a room admin with@grahamperrin. Guess I confused myself :P
[2017-03-16 14:23:15] <cbj4074> Nope :D Just a powerless Joe.
[2017-03-16 14:23:36] <cbj4074> But we should be!
[2017-03-16 14:24:02] <cbj4074> Then again, I really don't want any responsibility around here.
[2017-03-16 14:24:15] <InternetUnexplorer> I'm pretty sure@grahamperrinis an admin.
[2017-03-16 14:24:35] <InternetUnexplorer> I'll have to check back when I'm not on mobile and find the message.
[2017-03-16 14:28:49] <XIRGO> Hello all
[2017-03-16 14:29:31] <InternetUnexplorer> cbj4074: :(
[2017-03-16 14:30:08] <InternetUnexplorer> XIRGO: Hi there, we were just in a discussion about the best way to redirect you to gitterHQ/developers.
[2017-03-16 14:31:26] <cbj4074> 
[2017-03-16 14:31:31] <XIRGO> InternetUnexplorer: what is this room about, mostly general discussion about gitter?
[2017-03-16 14:32:02] <cbj4074> Yeah, with a focus on support, though.
[2017-03-16 14:32:34] <InternetUnexplorer> ^ There was a message when you joined, but it doesn't show on mobile.
[2017-03-16 16:42:24] <grahamperrin> I recently [<-LINK->] , and I do sometimes use the mobile interface, but I'm not entirely familiar with the flow of things when mobile users are automatically greeted in the lobby.In a real lobby it's pleasant to be given directions when in a rush or disoriented. So in this virtual lobby I prefer to offer directions before deleting things.
[2017-03-16 16:44:54] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @technokob_twitterYou can create private rooms for free without limits now
[2017-03-16 16:45:10] <grahamperrin> aayushis12: please see the greeting that was posted around an hour before your arrival. I'll delete your jQuery post from this Gitter support room; please repost in an appropriate area. Thanks.
[2017-03-16 17:06:42] <BenQ77> hi
[2017-03-16 18:08:59] <codTango> I just discovered this amazing chat app, got a question, how much chatting history that Gitter can have? My team is using discord, because it can give us all chatting history, so what's the ability of Gitter?
[2017-03-16 18:12:08] <grahamperrin> codTango: glance at [<-LINK->] the archive of this room.
[2017-03-16 18:18:49] <codTango> Oh, sweet. and one import feature my teammate just asked - giphy support. lol
[2017-03-16 18:19:45] <InternetUnexplorer> @codTango Plus, there'sfull markdown support!(unlike Discord)
[2017-03-16 18:20:31] <grahamperrin> codTango: try [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-16 18:46:26] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @codTangoUnlimited history. That archives page only shows 1 year but you can manually go back further (search will find anything as well)
[2017-03-16 18:48:33] <MadLittleMods> @codTango No first-party giphy support in Gitter but you can have a bot user handle it.You can track this issue for custom slash command support gitterHQ/gitter#583
[2017-03-16 18:55:56] <grahamperrin> MadLittleMods:  [<-ISSUE->] food for thought; I'll check whether e.g. Google can find what's expected/required in an archive
[2017-03-16 19:34:50] <Cloze> Does gitter have a delivery functionality ?
[2017-03-16 19:48:14] <MadLittleMods> @Cloze Not sure what you mean. Can you explain that another way?We have read by (read receipts)
[2017-03-16 19:48:37] <Cloze> MadLittleMods: in the email world, they call it: "Read Recipe"
[2017-03-16 19:48:44] <Cloze> like the second tick in telegram
[2017-03-16 19:48:56] <Cloze> MadLittleMods: :/
[2017-03-16 20:30:39] <revisualize> MadLittleMods: Congrats on getting Accuhired.
[2017-03-16 20:31:52] <revisualize> Or is it Acquhired.
[2017-03-16 20:33:57] <revisualize> I sure hope we don't loose 300GB of chat logs in the near future. That would suck.
[2017-03-16 20:46:31] <SalchiPapa> MadLittleMods: REPO INFOis unreadable with the dark theme:

[2017-03-16 20:52:58] <SalchiPapa> I'm using Chrome
[2017-03-16 21:43:34] <InternetUnexplorer> MadLittleMods REPO INFO is unreadable with the dark theme:@Ismael-VC Already reported, see #1554.
[2017-03-16 21:46:52] <SalchiPapa> Thank you!
[2017-03-16 23:21:04] <Duona> /help
[2017-03-16 23:31:32] <InternetUnexplorer> Duona: Well, it was worth a shot, wasn't it?
[2017-03-16 23:32:27] <InternetUnexplorer> Congrats on getting Accuhired.
[2017-03-16 23:32:40] <InternetUnexplorer> revisualize: **Acquired
[2017-03-16 23:33:32] <SalchiPapa> Duona: see:https://gitter.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200178991--commands
[2017-03-16 23:33:46] <revisualize> So it is Acquhired.
[2017-03-16 23:34:32] <InternetUnexplorer> Acquired != Acquhired,@revisualize.
[2017-03-16 23:35:57] <InternetUnexplorer> Unless you're making a pun, in which case I'm clueless.
[2017-03-16 23:37:14] <revisualize> It is actually a term when a company acquires another company and hires all of the core team members.
[2017-03-16 23:37:48] <revisualize> Those team members are Acquired + Hired = Acquhired.
[2017-03-16 23:38:24] <revisualize> There are some cases where companies are acquired and most of the team is terminated.
[2017-03-16 23:39:35] <revisualize> There are some cases when a company is acquired and team member wish to be let go as well.
[2017-03-16 23:48:05] <InternetUnexplorer> Ahh, I see. Thanks for the tip, sorry for "correcting" you.
[2017-03-17 02:39:23] <Goddard> can some one explain to me how to scale the interface up for Gitter desktop
[2017-03-17 02:39:43] <Goddard> on a 4k screen and the text is so small
[2017-03-17 02:49:08] <MadLittleMods> Goddard: See [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-03-17 02:54:30] <Goddard> MadLittleMods: cool
[2017-03-17 08:16:19] <gozonjoedaimar> MadLittleMods: ow, i see. hope you can add it on room settings. more like "recent mentions" menu
[2017-03-17 08:43:12] <himanshuraja> Hello there.
[2017-03-17 10:13:50] <grahamperrin> himanshuraja: welcome; [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-17 13:02:51] <perborgen> Hi! I've created a room from a repo. Now I'd like to change the name on the repo (because I want the name of the room to change). Is that possible?
[2017-03-17 17:15:40] <MadLittleMods> perborgen: Give a link to where the repo used to be and where it is now. Also pass a link to the room on Gitter. I can fix it up for you manually. See [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-17 19:46:24] <v-messer> How to set avatar on my profile&
[2017-03-17 19:46:27] <v-messer> ?
[2017-03-17 19:46:58] <v-messer> Is it uploaded fro GitHub?
[2017-03-17 19:47:15] <cbj4074> It's probably cached. Could take some time.
[2017-03-17 19:48:54] <v-messer> cbj4074: Thanks! I don't have one on GitHub, so it's probably cached somwhere in the universe haha
[2017-03-17 19:49:15] <cbj4074> Oh, hehe, yeah, it will use your GitHub one if you have one.
[2017-03-17 19:49:24] <cbj4074> Otherwise, god only knows.
[2017-03-17 19:50:35] <demhydraz> that is the default github one; it generates a random pattern of squares.
[2017-03-17 19:53:03] <v-messer> Ok, than i've created community. What does integrations do? Posts events, mentioned in  intergation setup dialog?
[2017-03-17 21:10:27] <pr-yemibedu> is each room its own managed website container?
[2017-03-17 21:11:58] <InternetUnexplorer> pr-yemibedu: What do you mean by "managed website container"?
[2017-03-17 21:13:25] <pr-yemibedu> I have been watching a lot of kubernetes. a pod is a logical set of containers (like docker). I was wondering if they manage all these rooms that way.
[2017-03-17 21:15:15] <demhydraz> no
[2017-03-17 21:15:18] <InternetUnexplorer> I believe Gitter uses Docker, though I'm not quite sure what they use it for.
[2017-03-17 21:15:40] <demhydraz> making one of these ridiculously heavy containers for each room would be silly
[2017-03-17 21:15:44] <demhydraz> but who knows
[2017-03-17 21:15:55] <InternetUnexplorer> I don'tthinkit's per room.
[2017-03-17 21:16:06] <pr-yemibedu> someone also should begin to update [<-LINK->] so it points to the path to open source and new alliance with GitLab
[2017-03-17 21:16:32] <pr-yemibedu> containers are actually suppose to be light, no?
[2017-03-17 21:16:46] <InternetUnexplorer> Lighter than a VM, yes.
[2017-03-17 21:17:07] <demhydraz> but still way heavier than, like, a process.
[2017-03-17 21:17:09] <InternetUnexplorer> ^
[2017-03-17 21:17:09] <demhydraz> or a thread.
[2017-03-17 21:17:22] <InternetUnexplorer> or an entry in a database.
[2017-03-17 21:17:39] <pr-yemibedu> I see where you are going.
[2017-03-17 21:17:50] <pr-yemibedu> just a link in a db would be easy.
[2017-03-17 21:20:00] <pr-yemibedu> they must just use them for the general requests that scope the login and id references for the rooms and topics.
[2017-03-17 21:20:52] <InternetUnexplorer> Them, as in, containers?I honestly have no idea what they use them for.
[2017-03-17 21:22:13] <pr-yemibedu> oh okay. I was in myshiny new thing I learned, everyone must be using itmode.
[2017-03-17 21:23:13] <InternetUnexplorer> pr-yemibedu: I know the feeling :P
[2017-03-17 21:57:09] <grahamperrin> TopShipment_twitter:  [<-LINK->] – familiarisation for newcomers. I'll delete your question from the Gitter support room, you may re-post elsewhere.
[2017-03-17 22:02:43] <Juan_x_x_twitter> Excuse me... im installing gitter... and id like to know systems requirements (hardware and software) and browser compatibility
[2017-03-17 22:04:03] <InternetUnexplorer> Juan_x_x_twitter: System requirements: Either it runs or it doesn't. You should meet the minimum. As for browser compatibility, I'm not sure what you mean
[2017-03-17 22:04:12] <InternetUnexplorer> grahamperrin:  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-17 22:07:09] <Juan_x_x_twitter> i meant minimu system requirements (cpu, ram, hard disk space)
[2017-03-17 22:07:41] <Juan_x_x_twitter> browser = id like to know if it works well on chrome, firefox, IE, etc
[2017-03-17 22:09:52] <InternetUnexplorer> As I said, it should run fine unless you have a really, really old computer. The browser is packaged, and thus you don't need to worry about compatibility.
[2017-03-17 22:12:50] <Juan_x_x_twitter> i use windows... do you recommend to install it on windows xp?
[2017-03-17 22:13:25] <InternetUnexplorer> You're running XP?
[2017-03-17 22:13:50] <Juan_x_x_twitter> windows 7 on this computer
[2017-03-17 22:13:58] <Juan_x_x_twitter> but i use XP too
[2017-03-17 22:14:13] <InternetUnexplorer> Windows 7 should work fine. As for XP, give it a go and see if it works.
[2017-03-17 22:16:08] <Juan_x_x_twitter> Thanks@InternetUnexplorer
[2017-03-17 22:19:52] <v-messer> Was Gitter created just to support freecodecamp?
[2017-03-17 22:24:39] <pdurbin> I highly doubt it.
[2017-03-17 22:26:12] <grahamperrin> v-messer: thanks for asking. I don't know, the [<-LINK->] announcement (2014-02-14) may be a good starting point to learn about the origins.
[2017-03-17 22:32:08] <pdurbin> yes, nice starting point, thanks, I hadn't seen that, I don't believe
[2017-03-17 22:39:49] <grahamperrin> InternetUnexplorer: thank you.
[2017-03-17 22:52:09] <grahamperrin> @MadLittleMods @suprememoocow @mydigitalself and all, hi, I edited the topnav line for more immediate visibility of:the phrase Gitter support
the link to the support area
the word before– screenshots at https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/sandbox?at=58cc613f01bcf42439a55ef4 – is my edition of the line OK with you?Rationale: less repetition of directions to newcomers.Food for thoughtThe RTFM part of the linked support area gives prominence to only one room for chat, without making explicit that it's to chat about support for Gitter. The wording is very relaxed – "Fancy chatting with us?" …
[2017-03-17 23:12:39] <grahamperrin> To speakers of English who are not from Britain, a quickyes/noGitter-related question:without consulting a dictionary, do you equate "rhubarb rhubarb" with background noise?
[2017-03-17 23:14:58] <demhydraz> yes
[2017-03-17 23:42:12] <InternetUnexplorer> Was Gitter created just to support freecodecamp?@v-messer Was the internet created just to support Facebook?
[2017-03-18 00:02:41] <pdurbin> no on the background noise question
[2017-03-18 00:03:05] <InternetUnexplorer> No as well on that question, sorry I didn't see it earlier.
[2017-03-18 01:18:09] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @v-messerUpdate your avatar on GitHub, then sign out and sign back into Gitter
[2017-03-18 01:18:55] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @pr-yemibedu@InternetUnexplorer@demhydrazSee   [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-18 01:21:49] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @Juan_x_x_twitterWe don't have the minimum specced out. If you can run the webapp in a browser, it should run just fine in the desktop app. We support the last few versions of the major browsers
[2017-03-18 01:30:49] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @grahamperrin I've removed the more rooms piece because we have the explicit globe button up there already. We try to take a more relaxed approach to the prose used ;) Have something better in mind?
[2017-03-18 02:48:39] <grahamperrin> Relaxed wording and attitudes are good things  and should be coupled with consistency. There's carefree encouragement to chat in this room; there should by equally carefree, welcoming responses when newcomers post things that are off-topic.
[2017-03-18 02:57:06] <grahamperrin> MadLittleMods: thewrittenpresentation of [<-LINK->] – the familiarisation –
[2017-03-18 02:58:01] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-18 02:59:06] <grahamperrin> – was to compensate for newcomers who (for any reason) do not click on theiconicrepresentation.
[2017-03-18 03:06:41] <grahamperrin> If I search then browse [<-LINK->] I guess that I'll find a handful of issues about on-screen positioning of elements. tl;dr I reckon that the current position of the globe causes it to be overlooked or (as part of a set of elements) simply ignored by some newcomers.
[2017-03-18 03:20:32] <grahamperrin> demhydraz: @pdurbin@InternetUnexplorerthanks. When I first saw therhubarbroom at [<-LINK->] I knew – without reading the sideline – that it is (or should be) a place foreasygoingchat about anything. I wondered whether "rhubarb rhubarb" is internationally understood … it's not :-) and yesterday at [<-LINK->] I found "… unlike the UK usage, …muttering by an angry mob, …".
[2017-03-18 03:24:45] <grahamperrin> With Gitter for Android: there's no written sideline, no explanation of rhubarb. JustWelcome to gitterHQ/rhubarb!at join time.
[2017-03-18 03:40:32] <grahamperrin> v-messer: when I first began using Gitter I assumed that it was FreeCodeCamp-related. Maybe at the time there was more prominence toFreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCampand its "Welcome to our main chat room. …" at [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-18 03:45:31] <grahamperrin> I so rarely see [<-LINK->] (it's on screen now) it took me a few minutes to remember how I got there.
[2017-03-18 06:06:23] <v-messer> Was the internet created just to support Facebook?@InternetUnexplorer No doubts that Karmically it was
[2017-03-18 06:08:42] <v-messer> Why was both strings quoted, while i put > only on first?
[2017-03-18 06:26:43] <grahamperrin> v-messer: I had the same problem, with compose mode, a few times in the past. Join me in the [<-LINK->] and experiment with line spacing.
[2017-03-18 09:59:04] <grahamperrin> MatrixAt (for example) [<-LINK->] there's a string of messages from one user ID for multiple people. Where – with@matrixbot– one person is indistinguishable from another, how can a user of Gitter address an individual person?
[2017-03-18 10:08:43] <grahamperrin> tmandry: @leonerddoes [<-ISSUE->] relate, or is that a separate issue?
[2017-03-18 10:14:59] <grahamperrin> Gitter does not find any user matchingWelox(at first, I misread the ID) orVVelox. [<-LINK->] exists but might be not the same VVelox who uses Matrix.From past experience I know that@jaypatelani(the other person in the dual-personality single-user conversation) is a user of Gitter.
[2017-03-18 13:24:59] <RABEARISON> hey, someone has experiences with Modem.Js (npm install modem) ?
[2017-03-18 14:39:19] <grahamperrin> RABEARISON: welcome, and before we offer directions, a quick question for you: did you notice the globe icon at the top of the browser window and if so, were you tempted to click it?
[2017-03-18 14:42:12] <RABEARISON> grahamperrin: yes, so should i post my question to nodejs/node conversation?
[2017-03-18 14:42:39] <grahamperrin> That seems reasonable :-)
[2017-03-18 14:43:55] <grahamperrin> RABEARISON: in retrospect, might you have found your way sooner, or more easily, if there had been a written encouragement to browse the list of rooms?
[2017-03-18 14:55:48] <RABEARISON> Sorry, I've mixed the Gitter Chatroom (FreeCodeCamp) with this room
[2017-03-18 15:02:16] <grahamperrin> RABEARISON: no problem. I'm curious because re: the screenshot at [<-LINK->] above, a few hours ago I toyed with a change to the line in the topnav bar.
[2017-03-18 17:42:47] <DrWongKC> Did you guys close Game Dev group for FreeCodeCamp on Gitter?
[2017-03-18 17:47:31] <grahamperrin> DrWongKC: Google finds "FreeCodeCamp / GameDev. This room will be closed and archived. Please move discussion of this topic to our forum, or to one of the official Free Code Camp ..."

[2017-03-20 00:54:08] <InternetUnexplorer> Paradox5: yep.
[2017-03-20 05:10:36] <Boscop> can gitter be used in a local gitlab installation?
[2017-03-20 07:25:55] <Razva> any way to reach the Gitter staff? I've sent a message but nobody seems to reply 
[2017-03-20 07:27:56] <grahamperrin> Razva: was the message via e-mail, or some other channel? [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-20 07:28:27] <Razva> ticket, but no idea what's the ID (deleted the notification)
[2017-03-20 07:29:01] <Razva> my request is simple: delete a community that - from reason I cannot understand - I cannot delete, so I can recreate it again
[2017-03-20 07:29:21] <Razva> I've created the community not via the Github account so that might be an issue...
[2017-03-20 07:35:41] <Razva> just sent a ticket again:
[2017-03-20 07:35:55] <Razva>  [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-03-20 09:53:29] <mydigitalself> samccone: thanks :)
[2017-03-20 09:58:53] <mydigitalself> Razva: looks like you created the group using a twitter account, not this GitHub account
[2017-03-20 09:59:15] <mydigitalself> if you sign out, sign in with your twitter account, you can add your GitHub account as an admin
[2017-03-20 10:03:23] <mydigitalself> listochkin: thanks!
[2017-03-20 10:05:03] <mydigitalself> @AshleyGrant it will mean that Gitter will be open sourced, so perhaps the community could also help with search.also worth pointing out that all of our public conversations are indexed by google etc... and we see a lot of search happening off network, so the information is out there.
[2017-03-20 14:16:42] <InternetUnexplorer> Waihenya: Thanks :)
[2017-03-20 14:18:12] <Waihenya> InternetUnexplorer: thanks
[2017-03-20 15:37:41] <kapilkd13> Hi Is there a way to send a file via gitter, I am new here. On google I found we can drag and drop, but is there a way to send files by a prompt window, something like a upload box.
[2017-03-20 16:19:12] <grahamperrin> kapilkd13: drop in the message field.
[2017-03-20 16:20:43] <InternetUnexplorer> ... or drag it anywhere in the browser pane

[2017-03-20 18:29:39] <Razva> mydigitalself: well...I left the channel from that user, or at least it doesn't appears in my list... [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-20 18:30:48] <mydigitalself> you must have left or deleted the channel with that user
[2017-03-20 18:31:01] <Razva> possible...
[2017-03-20 18:31:02] <mydigitalself> but, if you click onAdd a room(as that user) you should be able to add a new one?
[2017-03-20 18:31:15] <Razva> yeah but not with the same link
[2017-03-20 18:31:36] <Razva> btw, when I click "Add a room" I get ONLY the option to create a new room.
[2017-03-20 18:31:42] <Razva> using Chrome & Windows10
[2017-03-20 18:31:44] <mydigitalself> yes
[2017-03-20 18:32:06] <mydigitalself> /CNCTED is not a room, it would have been the community base url
[2017-03-20 18:32:16] <mydigitalself> so your room would have been something like /CNCTED/lobby
[2017-03-20 18:32:21] <Razva> got it
[2017-03-20 18:32:29] <Razva> so at this point how can I regain access?
[2017-03-20 18:33:07] <mydigitalself> as the twitter user, create a new room, then go to that room's permissions, and you should see a link to change the permissions for the whole community and you can add your GitHub user as an admin
[2017-03-20 18:35:11] <Razva> Logged in with the Twitter account: [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-20 18:35:19] <Razva> no "add a room" option :\
[2017-03-20 18:35:39] <mydigitalself> click the top left chat icon
[2017-03-20 18:35:50] <Razva> ok
[2017-03-20 18:36:00] <Razva> ALL CONVERSATIONS ?
[2017-03-20 18:36:14] <mydigitalself> yes, at the bottom of all conversations, do you see an add a room button now?
[2017-03-20 18:36:22] <Razva> got it
[2017-03-20 18:36:36] <mydigitalself> not sure why it's not showing on the community view, will investigate
[2017-03-20 18:38:27] <Razva> finally in. next, can you please let me know how can I add myself as an Admin?
[2017-03-20 18:39:00] <mydigitalself> create a new room, then go to that room's permissions, and you should see a link to change the permissions for the whole community and you can add your GitHub user as an admin
[2017-03-20 18:39:27] <mydigitalself> when you are in the room, click the options icon top right next to your avatar
[2017-03-20 18:39:29] <mydigitalself> Permissions
[2017-03-20 18:39:33] <mydigitalself> at the bottom, etc...
[2017-03-20 18:39:33] <Razva> done
[2017-03-20 18:40:05] <mydigitalself> you didEdit Community Permissionsfrom there and added your GitHub user?
[2017-03-20 18:40:22] <Razva> just a sec to check
[2017-03-20 18:41:32] <Razva> great success! :)
[2017-03-20 18:41:42] <Razva> last step, how do I delete the Twitter user?
[2017-03-20 18:42:11] <mydigitalself> send a request tosupport@gitter.im
[2017-03-20 18:42:33] <mydigitalself> actually, 1 sec
[2017-03-20 18:42:40] <mydigitalself> what's the username, i can just do it now
[2017-03-20 18:42:51] <Razva> just a sec to see
[2017-03-20 18:42:55] <Razva> razva_Twitter?
[2017-03-20 18:44:54] <Razva> yup, Razva_twitter
[2017-03-20 18:44:59] <Razva> Razva: username :)
[2017-03-20 18:45:09] <Razva> ^ that would be@RazvaTWITTER username
[2017-03-20 18:46:16] <mydigitalself> done
[2017-03-20 19:04:33] <Razva> thank you
[2017-03-20 19:04:47] <Razva> you guys should really, really need to work out the UI
[2017-03-20 19:06:32] <Razva> any way to link a Gitter room with a slack room?
[2017-03-20 19:06:34] <mydigitalself> you've done something completely unanticipated
[2017-03-20 19:06:52] <Razva> because at this point we're using Slack but might switch to Gitter
[2017-03-20 19:07:14] <Razva> hehe, leaving the only existing room == unanticipated? :D
[2017-03-20 19:07:26] <mydigitalself> well, that and using two different accounts
[2017-03-20 19:08:12] <mydigitalself> you can use sameroom to link the rooms, but the user experience isn't great - we don't have impersonation in our API, so all the messages will effectively come from a single user, making replies fairly sucky
[2017-03-20 19:08:52] <Razva> great success
[2017-03-20 19:09:43] <Razva> as a hint, if a community has only one room, you should keep the same model as with a community with more than one room
[2017-03-20 19:10:12] <Razva> example: [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-20 19:11:06] <Razva> gitterHQ has more rooms => gitterHQ/gitter, which is great. CNCTED has only one room => CNCTED, but it feels a little bit "unpolished" because everything should behave in the same way.
[2017-03-20 19:11:35] <Razva> for a newb like me, at this point there's no way for me to see that the main channel name for CNCTED is Lobby, because I cannot find "Lobby" anywhere. :)
[2017-03-20 19:13:32] <mydigitalself> yeah, it's something we've probably got wrong. many of our communities just have a single room, and we wanted to avoid having a list of:x/lobbyy/lobbyz/lobbydealing with multiple namespaces in a single network is pretty tricksy. slack doesn't have this problem.
[2017-03-20 19:13:39] <mydigitalself> conceptually i mean
[2017-03-20 19:14:40] <SimonDarksideJ> Hi There
[2017-03-20 19:15:10] <SimonDarksideJ> Any chance I can get my doppleganger Twitter account deleted? Getting duplicate emails now
[2017-03-20 19:18:28] <Razva> mydigitalself: you could solve this by allowing users to specify their own channel name when creating a new community and not creating the "lobby" channel by default (which is wrong if you ask me).
[2017-03-20 19:19:09] <Razva> DDReaper: haha, just had this issue,@mydigitalselfhelped me with a deletion :)
[2017-03-20 19:19:11] <mydigitalself> yip, that's a solution - was trying to remove a step from the process
[2017-03-20 19:19:18] <mydigitalself> DDReaper: what's the twitter handle?
[2017-03-20 19:21:42] <Razva> I'm out, see you later
[2017-03-20 19:22:20] <mydigitalself> cya
[2017-03-20 19:23:50] <SimonDarksideJ> SimonDarksideJ@mydigitalself
[2017-03-20 19:24:41] <SimonDarksideJ> Razva: let users manage their profile, that'll never go down well :P
[2017-03-20 19:25:11] <SimonDarksideJ> Thanks for looking in to this@mydigitalself
[2017-03-20 19:25:19] <mydigitalself> sure, that's done
[2017-03-20 19:25:44] <SimonDarksideJ> Tar, my inbox can now rest a little easier :D
[2017-03-20 19:25:59] <mydigitalself> will be looking to add this functionality to gitter and, one day, the possibility to link profiles
[2017-03-20 19:30:54] <SimonDarksideJ> Woot, happy to beta test. Changing name to "SpockIsMyOtherName" for fun
[2017-03-20 20:37:55] <Omeryl> mydigitalself: search is a pretty difficult thing to do in the context of chat, just look at IRCCloud and how long they took, or Discord's latest blog post
[2017-03-20 20:38:03] <Omeryl> If it's going to be done, please do it right ;)
[2017-03-20 20:38:18] <Omeryl>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-20 21:09:04] <mydigitalself> yip, read that the other day. it's really hard in chat context, especially given we've got a really tiny team. hopefully the community can help out as we open source gitter.
[2017-03-20 21:42:38] <eddieschoute> Hi, sorry I could not find it in the docs, but can communities be private? If not that is fine, but is there a control over who joins a community? If not, is there a control over which rooms people in the community can see? I know there are private invite-only rooms, but what purpose do private rooms serve that everyone in a (public, if they aren't private) community can join?
[2017-03-20 22:31:11] <pdurbin> mydigitalself: : tiny? Can you say much about the team? Number of devs, designers, etc. Just curious.
[2017-03-21 02:10:38] <grahamperrin> mydigitalself: FYI indexing by e.g. Google of public chat is only partial at this time.
[2017-03-21 02:55:30] <grahamperrin> Mysteries of GitterIn the web interface: far left, what's [<-LINK->] ?
[2017-03-21 03:16:12] <nadex2021> Kk
[2017-03-21 09:54:21] <Cydmi>  [<-LINK->] in chrome device toolbal vue dblclick invalid！
[2017-03-21 09:58:11] <Cydmi>  [<-LINK->] Who encountered such a problem? this is my code
[2017-03-21 12:13:03] <mydigitalself> @grahamperrin internally, we call it the minibar, but it's probably best called a Shortcut bar perhaps?it has default icons for All Conversations, Search, People & Groups.From Groups, you can drag and drop your favourite groups (only groups, not rooms) onto the bar.
[2017-03-21 12:13:34] <mydigitalself> pdurbin: there are just four of us
[2017-03-21 13:07:07] <grahamperrin> … drop your favourite groups (only groups, not rooms) onto the bar.Thanks @mydigitalself does that explain:why I can not get GitterHQ to the left of that bar; and/or 
why the star at https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/home does not allow me to favour GitterHQ?
[2017-03-21 13:11:37] <mydigitalself> hmmm, 2. looks like a bug
[2017-03-21 13:11:58] <mydigitalself> for 1, if you click on Groups icon (the fourth one down) then drag GitterHQ onto the minibar
[2017-03-21 13:12:37] <mydigitalself> yip, 2 is producing a javascript error [<-CODE->] 
[2017-03-21 13:51:27] <pdurbin> mydigitalself: you've gotten a lot done with four people. Good job. :)
[2017-03-21 16:16:50] <jb510> Excited for the Gitter + GitLab possibilities.  I love Slack, but linking every new repo with every new channel (we create a channel per project and have a lot of short term client service projects).  So... feature requet, make it really easy to post repo info (PRs, merges, commits to master, etc...) with Gitter... without having to copy paste webhooks, emails, etc..
[2017-03-21 22:06:49] <pdurbin> jb510: you should add your feature request to [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-21 22:40:42] <jhalterman>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-21 22:40:53] <jhalterman> Is it no longer possible to get a gitter URL that mirrors your github URL, or is there some different way I should be doing this? Example attached
[2017-03-21 22:41:53] <jhalterman>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-21 22:41:54] <jhalterman> Somewhat related, trying my project name without my Github username is a no go, even though the URL is not taken. Any idea why?
[2017-03-22 03:15:03] <enosmj> Hello World
[2017-03-22 03:15:41] <InternetUnexplorer> enosmj: Are you from FreeCodeCamp by any chance?
[2017-03-22 03:25:10] <InternetUnexplorer> grahamperrin: I have no idea how they end up in this room.Anyways, none of them seem to read the directions, and they never come back to the room.Even though I posted a reply to@enosmj's message seconds after he posted his, he hasn't read it.He most likely closed the tab immediately after posting that, and I doubt he'll be back.Any reasons for not deleting the "Hello world" messages on the spot?
[2017-03-22 03:31:21] <grahamperrin> InternetUnexplorer: various reasons.
[2017-03-22 03:31:50] <grahamperrin> Past 03:30 in the morning here, I'll investigate at a more reasonable hour.
[2017-03-22 03:31:59] <InternetUnexplorer> alright.
[2017-03-22 04:18:51] <enosmj> grahamperrin: Ended up here from rookie starting challenge
[2017-03-22 04:19:25] <grahamperrin> enosmj: thanks, do you have a link for that challenge?
[2017-03-22 04:20:22] <enosmj> InternetUnexplorer@InternetUnexplorerhere from FreeCodeCamp

[2017-03-22 04:29:21] <grahamperrin> Thanks. After your initial sign in to Gitter, did you find yourself:automatically redirected to Free Code Camp's Main Chat  embedded at https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/learn-how-free-code-camp-works or 
automatically redirected to https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp
[2017-03-22 04:29:57] <grahamperrin> If neither of the above, then please: after your initial sign in to Gitter, can you recall where you found yourself?
[2017-03-22 09:15:04] <grahamperrin> Screenshots of an experimental Twitter-authenticated introduction to FreeCodeCamp chat (excluding authenticated first arrival in the room), beginning with the home experience:

[2017-03-22 09:23:21] <grahamperrin> Gitter
[2017-03-22 09:23:33] <grahamperrin> gitterHQ
[2017-03-22 09:23:34] <grahamperrin> gitter
[2017-03-22 09:28:10] <grahamperrin> … yeah, OK, I get the idea, it's Gitter, which I never heard of before the FreeCodeCamp front page link to FreeCodeCamp chat. There's no longer a hint to visit somewhere before chatting. There's a prominent invitation to join.
[2017-03-22 09:28:33] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-22 09:28:40] <grahamperrin> – that's clear enough.

[2017-03-22 09:30:23] <grahamperrin> – the missing link, obscured until after I hovered over part of the gitter gitter gitter gitter gitter array.
[2017-03-22 09:30:54] <grahamperrin> Back to the FreeCodeCamp front page:

[2017-03-22 09:31:52] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-22 09:32:19] <grahamperrin> – FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp can not be joined.
[2017-03-22 09:40:36] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] requires nine steps across six tabs. At a glance, thechallengeof joining is neatly organised, however: with so many steps and tabs, I forgive anyone for overlooking a plea at any stage in any one or more of the tabs.
[2017-03-22 11:21:54] <Virdo>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-22 11:22:14] <Virdo> anyone can help me?
[2017-03-22 11:22:18] <Virdo> thx
[2017-03-22 12:14:46] <mydigitalself> @jhalterman yip, we're moving away from being GitHub only, and step 1 has been to break away from personal projects namespace like that. right now we still respect GitHub's namespace, so the reason that can't be created is because /failsafe exists in the GitHub namespace.obviously as this unfolds, we'll be entirely breaking away from the GitHub namespace in the futurehttp://blog.gitter.im/2017/03/15/gitter-gitlab-acquisition/
[2017-03-22 14:15:24] <j113203_twitter> my account can't send any message in gitter even in my private room...the api status code is 200 means the message is sent and return the message id , but when i using api to get the message by this return id , it return an 404 not found message.

[2017-03-22 14:20:50] <InternetUnexplorer> grahamperrin: Thanks for the reply, that makes a lot of sense.
[2017-03-22 14:21:26] <InternetUnexplorer> enosmj: Sorry if I sounded cross earlier, I didn't mean to.
[2017-03-22 14:21:53] <InternetUnexplorer> Virdo:  gitterHQ/developers
[2017-03-22 14:26:01] <j113203_twitter> some example [<-CODE->] 
[2017-03-22 14:35:15] <grahamperrin> InternetUnexplorer: it's OK, not a problem, nice of you to apologise.
[2017-03-22 23:11:57] <Brekmister> Hey, Gitter is glitching out with non-existant organizations and repos, is there an admin online?
[2017-03-22 23:13:13] <InternetUnexplorer> Brekmister: You can mention an admin, but I would recommend opening an issue instead.
[2017-03-22 23:14:16] <Brekmister> InternetUnexplorer: Thanks, already tried email and it's kinda urgent in a way
[2017-03-22 23:15:33] <InternetUnexplorer> If it needs immediate action, I would mention one of the admins. MadLittleMods and mydigitalself tend to be online.
[2017-03-22 23:16:30] <Brekmister> MadLittleMods: @mydigitalselfEither of you two online?
[2017-03-22 23:17:55] <Brekmister> or perhaps@suprememoocow?
[2017-03-22 23:19:28] <InternetUnexplorer> I doubt they will respond immediately, instead you should post a description of your problem so that they can help you even when you are not online.
[2017-03-22 23:20:21] <Brekmister> InternetUnexplorer: Working on a descriptive issue on github right now, will make a ZenDesk request as well
[2017-03-22 23:21:44] <InternetUnexplorer> Please don't. Gitter is currently run by a 4 person team, and so posting multiple things about the same issue will only create extra work for them and make it take longer for your problem to be fixed.
[2017-03-22 23:22:10] <InternetUnexplorer> They will get to it as soon as they can.
[2017-03-22 23:22:40] <Brekmister> InternetUnexplorer: I didn't realize that. Then the email should be fine enough
[2017-03-22 23:23:41] <Brekmister> InternetUnexplorer: You caught me before writing the issue. I won't bother them any more then they have to.
[2017-03-22 23:25:39] <Brekmister> InternetUnexplorer: Do you happen to know what happens to a community if a organization it's linked to is deleted on github?
[2017-03-22 23:26:18] <Brekmister> Then a different organization gets named to the deleted one?
[2017-03-22 23:26:28] <InternetUnexplorer> Thanks. Just a heads up: I hear they've been having some issues with email recently, if you could provide some details here in chat then others should be able to assist you.
[2017-03-22 23:27:03] <InternetUnexplorer> I would assume the Gitter organization remains here regardless of the fact that the GitHub one was deleted,@Brekmister
[2017-03-22 23:27:49] <Brekmister> And it's causing gitter to prevent me to make any rooms whatsoever because of some kind of glitch.bug
[2017-03-22 23:30:02] <Brekmister> I deleted the rooms without realizing that and now my people are confused as to what has happened.
[2017-03-22 23:30:46] <Brekmister> I guess they just need to run the refresh script if that's how the script works
[2017-03-22 23:31:32] <InternetUnexplorer> ... it's not how "the script" works.
[2017-03-22 23:31:46] <InternetUnexplorer> Good luck, hopefully someone can help you out soon.
[2017-03-23 01:18:53] <MadLittleMods>  March 22, 2017 6:16 PM @Brekmister Please refrain from pinging directly, anyone available will help you. I understand it was a blocker for you but wasn't urgentYour email ticket has been addressed
[2017-03-23 01:22:36] <Brekmister> MadLittleMods: Yeah sorry about that.

[2017-03-23 13:18:40] <lolmaus> I've just persuaded a head of an open source project to use Gitter over Slack, and starting the community in Gitter was extremely frustrating for him.
[2017-03-23 13:19:11] <mydigitalself> what issues did he run into@lolmaus?
[2017-03-23 13:19:43] <lolmaus> There seems to be no way to make thegitter.im/org-namechatroom public. And once a non-admin org member leaves that room, they can't get back in.
[2017-03-23 13:20:22] <lolmaus> And the mobile app seems to be feature-limited in regard of starting/managing a commnity.
[2017-03-23 13:21:27] <mydigitalself> there's never been the ability to have the [<-LINK->] public, that was previously reserved for just org members, but isn't supported any more for new projects. in the same way as github, you always need [<-LINK->] for a room.
[2017-03-23 13:22:56] <lolmaus> mydigitalself: Well, we just started a new community, and this special room was there, and we were clueless that it was special...
[2017-03-23 13:23:23] <mydigitalself> erm, i would like to say that would be impossible
[2017-03-23 13:23:45] <mydigitalself> did you check the actual URL of the room?
[2017-03-23 13:25:07] <lolmaus> mydigitalself:  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-23 13:27:29] <mydigitalself> wow, i was 100% convinced we removed that functionality from new communities - did you only recently create the community or was it previously created and not used?
[2017-03-23 13:45:50] <lolmaus> mydigitalself: We created it like an hour ago.
[2017-03-23 13:48:34] <lolmaus> What do I minimally need to be able to start new rooms for an organization? Is there a way to let me do that without making me an all-powerful admin?
[2017-03-23 13:53:51] <mydigitalself> as long as you are a member of the org, you can create new rooms
[2017-03-23 14:14:46] <lolmaus>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-23 14:14:54] <lolmaus> A minor bug 
[2017-03-23 14:16:55] <lolmaus> mydigitalself: I'm a member of the org and I can't see a way to start a new room.
[2017-03-23 14:40:45] <mydigitalself> I'm a member of the org and I can't see a way to start a new room. [<-CODE->] 
[2017-03-23 14:40:51] <mydigitalself> lolmaus: 
[2017-03-23 14:53:09] <lolmaus> mydigitalself: Thank you. 
[2017-03-23 18:24:18] <dom96> Guys, is this a known bug: . [<-LINK->] .
[2017-03-23 18:24:33] <dom96> I typed in: .[1].
[2017-03-23 18:24:41] <dom96> And it turns into a random link
[2017-03-23 18:24:46] <oprypin> when you type   something [<-LINK->] you get a random link that someone previously typed in some message
[2017-03-23 18:25:09] <oprypin> something[1]  that is
[2017-03-23 18:25:20] <dom96> heh, guess I beat you to it.
[2017-03-23 18:27:06] <dom96> It also seems to happen randomly.
[2017-03-23 18:27:13] <dom96> Occassionally it doesn't get turned into a link
[2017-03-23 18:31:54] <mydigitalself> markdown parser is probably thinking it's an MD link ala[title](link)
[2017-03-23 18:32:29] <oprypin> no, it's an MD link ala  [1][1]: [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-23 18:32:47] <oprypin> except the bottom part is taken from some random message
[2017-03-23 18:36:51] <mydigitalself> can you file a bug for it pls
[2017-03-23 18:37:17] <mydigitalself> can't really think what could be causing that, the markdown parser runs in an isolated process pool
[2017-03-23 18:37:53] <dom96> It's usually either: [<-LINK->] or [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-23 18:38:03] <dom96> I wonder where it's getting those links from
[2017-03-23 18:38:28] <oprypin> well one of those i typed earlier in another channel
[2017-03-23 18:41:09] <oprypin> dom96: who's filing the bug?
[2017-03-23 18:42:29] <dom96> oprypin: I don't mind.
[2017-03-23 18:42:54] <oprypin> dom96: no i'm doing it lol
[2017-03-23 18:43:22] <dom96> oprypin: go for it :)
[2017-03-23 21:23:13] <TitouanT> hello, I am wondering if it is possible to change the private/public state of a room
[2017-03-23 21:24:07] <MadLittleMods> TitouanT: Not yet, you can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-03-23 21:25:18] <TitouanT> thanks@MadLittleMods
[2017-03-24 09:34:04] <geojensen> How can I embed a gitter chatroom into my php website?  Any libraries out there?
[2017-03-24 09:39:04] <mydigitalself> geojensen: what happens when you search google for "embed gitter" ?

[2017-03-24 10:22:49] <flexiondotorg> Hi all, my name is Martin Wimpress. I am a software engineer at Canonical working on Ubuntu and Snapcraft.
[2017-03-24 10:23:09] <geojensen> hi Martin
[2017-03-24 10:23:54] <flexiondotorg> Is there someone here I can talk to about creating a snap of Gitter to help get it in front of more Linux users? :-)
[2017-03-24 10:24:43] <flexiondotorg> I saw Gitter is Open Sourcing all the things now and we're already talking to GitLab about doing the same.
[2017-03-24 12:32:12] <cbj4074> flexiondotorg: That is fantastic. Welcome. While I'm sure@MadLittleModscan point you in the right direction, there's a room dedicated to development, gitterHQ/developers
[2017-03-24 12:32:32] <cbj4074> Might be worth checking there in the short-term.
[2017-03-24 12:33:08] <flexiondotorg> cbj4074: Thanks for the info. I'll join that room 
[2017-03-24 12:33:57] <cbj4074>  Any time!

[2017-03-24 15:22:38] <mydigitalself> @flexiondotorg we actually spoke briefly with Leo Arias about doing this for the desktop app (https://github.com/gitterHQ/desktop/) - you're welcome to start there with a PR, I'm not sure if Leo followed up with creating an issue to discuss it there.it's going to take us a little while to open source everything else, but certainly it would be great to have as easy distribution as possible
[2017-03-24 15:23:52] <flexiondotorg> mydigitalself: Yep, I saw Leo has been in touch a while back.
[2017-03-24 15:23:55] <mydigitalself> oprypin: @dom96if you can try reproduce that issue again... haven't managed to myself since@MadLittleModspushed something, which i deployed this morning
[2017-03-24 15:24:40] <flexiondotorg> We can tackle this a couple of different ways, we collaborate on getting snap builds into your tree.
[2017-03-24 15:25:32] <flexiondotorg> The other option is, we can make a snap from the debs you're already producing.
[2017-03-24 15:25:56] <flexiondotorg> I'm working exclusively with Electron base products right now.
[2017-03-24 15:26:27] <flexiondotorg> We've got an initiative to get about a dozen new Electron apps in the store and celebrate them.
[2017-03-24 15:27:14] <flexiondotorg> You interested in participating? That could simply be that we publish Gitter client, on your behalf, for now and then hand over ownership at a later date.
[2017-03-24 15:30:12] <mydigitalself> for sure, that would be a good approach. ours is actually nw.js not electron btw
[2017-03-24 16:32:14] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @flexiondotorgSee [<-ISSUE->] - Better to chat in [<-LINK->] for desktop stuff instead ofgitterHQ/developerswhich has moved to a general technical chat (not necessarily Gitter related)
[2017-03-24 17:10:32] <oprypin> mydigitalself: still reproduces. testing[1]
[2017-03-24 17:40:14] <mydigitalself> oprypin: that one obviously didn't - do you have an example?
[2017-03-24 20:27:17] <Frodox> Hi all. I'm trying to integrate gitter on our team's workflow. Last thing - are there any way to integrate it with redmine? I can hack redmine to send webhooks, but how can I instruct gitter, that #N - not gitlab's one, but redmine's ..?
[2017-03-24 20:29:45] <MadLittleMods> Frodox: Not possible at the moment. You can track [<-ISSUE->] and [<-ISSUE->] which may mean a more general solution that would support redmine
[2017-03-24 21:03:21] <Frodox> MadLittleMods: looks like the only 'fast' way - send PR with integration ..:)
[2017-03-24 23:10:11] <oprypin> mydigitalself: that's my example. just try it many times. testing [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-24 23:14:15] <MadLittleMods> Thanks@oprypin, I'll look into it more :/
[2017-03-24 23:16:35] <oprypin> i suspect that the problem went away when you restarted your markdown processes because nobody had yet written a reference link
[2017-03-24 23:17:32] <oprypin> but in the issue i also wrote how to produce these reference links,  so you don't need to wait for someone somewhere to do that
[2017-03-24 23:20:55] <MadLittleMods> @oprypin I added tests that failed previously and now pass after the fix I added yesterday https://github.com/gitterHQ/gitter-markdown-processor/pull/7/files#diff-17324b782801ba275d34e9f6c5ebadf7R29But I guess there is still another way to reproduce
[2017-03-24 23:26:16] <oprypin> good work on that test  :)
[2017-03-25 00:28:33] <MadLittleMods> oprypin: I rolled out another fix with the dependency properly updated  Ping me if you can still reproduce
[2017-03-25 08:57:21] <oprypin> looks good
[2017-03-25 13:18:05] <Shamvuchandradas> Hi,

[2017-03-25 16:17:52] <mstellaluna> I have a gitter user that is verbal aggressive via unsolicited IM's .. he's already been banned by moderators of FreeCodeCamp. how do I report him to gitter?
[2017-03-25 16:22:21] <mstellaluna> a screenshot can be provided if need be
[2017-03-25 16:24:28] <lydatech> MadLittleMods: Same issue with that same user neal23mike. could we get a ban please. I have banned him from the FCC chats but hes contacting users via IM
[2017-03-25 16:35:05] <mstellaluna> the user  neal23mike is now up to 16 verbally violent messages

[2017-03-25 18:21:44] <robsd> Not sure if this is the right place to ask this but why is my username on Gitter@robdixn_twitter? Is it because I enabled login with Twitter or is it a glitch? My username everywhere else is just@robdixn, this is driving my OCD crazy
[2017-03-25 18:27:11] <InternetUnexplorer> robdixn: I don't see the problem here.
[2017-03-25 21:40:45] <robsd> InternetUnexplorer: it's fine here but in other gitter chats my username appears as@robdixn_twitter
[2017-03-25 23:49:26] <grahamperrin> robdixn: browse to a room where your posts are affected, sign out, then sign in without using Twitter. That will not change the ID for past posts, but should ensure that future posts are made using the required ID.
[2017-03-26 09:31:16] <andreykurilin> hi folks! Do you have a gitter app for rpm-based linux?
[2017-03-26 10:39:26] <robsd> grahamgilbert: ok thanks, I've done that and I think it's worked because it's working in this chat
[2017-03-26 12:49:32] <grahamperrin> andreykurilin:  [<-LINK->] I don't see any amongst the third party apps.
[2017-03-26 17:40:11] <Lawanu> how to do user input time out in java using scanner class?i got stuck...i have to complete one project by tomorrow.Kindly help me out._
[2017-03-26 22:34:35] <andreykurilin> grahamperrin: page you posted, includes information that gitter supports linux. But actually there is only debian-based application available..
[2017-03-27 14:10:50] <bill-auger> wtf did the chat "send" button go?
[2017-03-27 14:11:37] <bill-auger> or was there not one? - ive been trying to post a message in another channel but the enter key just adds a newline - no way to actually send the messgae
[2017-03-27 14:14:31] <bill-auger> nm i think  figured it out - seems i was somehow stuck in "compose mode" - though i dont think that feature existed last time i used this - i had to exit compose mode so that the enter would send the message
[2017-03-27 14:16:26] <bill-auger> terrible HCI folks - add a "send" button when in compose mode - or just use SHIFT-ENTER to add newline like every other chat program on the planet
[2017-03-27 14:17:16] <bill-auger> oo the dark theme is nice tho - thanks for that
[2017-03-27 14:20:30] <bill-auger> also thanks for the IRC bridge - thats why i dont usually need to know about these new features
[2017-03-27 14:20:43] <InternetUnexplorer> bill-auger: There is SHIFT+ENTER for newline.
[2017-03-27 14:20:53] <InternetUnexplorer> I have no idea why you're criticizing them for not having it when they have it.
[2017-03-27 14:22:01] <bill-auger> because i was stuck in a mode where it was not possible to send a simple message and i had no idea how i got into that mode
[2017-03-27 14:22:47] <bill-auger> and i can not imagine why anyone would ever want to be in a mode where you could not actually send your message - especially if SHIFT-ENTER already work in normal mode
[2017-03-27 14:23:35] <InternetUnexplorer> I use that mode all the time; Don't activate it if you don't want to.
[2017-03-27 14:24:06] <bill-auger> but i did not know that i did activate it
[2017-03-27 14:24:12] <bill-auger> i had no idea such a feature existed
[2017-03-27 14:24:44] <bill-auger> i eventually found the button that control this but it is nearly invisible
[2017-03-27 14:25:32] <InternetUnexplorer> The invisible-ness is meant to make it so you don't click it by accident... Isn't there usually a hint when you activate it, which pops up?
[2017-03-27 14:25:50] <bill-auger> i dont think so
[2017-03-27 14:26:07] <bill-auger> all i did was sign in and type a message - and i could not send it
[2017-03-27 14:27:08] <bill-auger> maybe i hit the shortcut  CTRL-/ accidentally but i saw no indication - nothing on the screen changes when you press that button
[2017-03-27 14:29:16] <InternetUnexplorer> For me, I get a little bubble with the shortcut on it that pops up.
[2017-03-27 14:29:28] <bill-auger> when i hover over the button yes
[2017-03-27 14:30:06] <bill-auger> nothing changes when you press it - there is no indication that you are in a mode that sending chat is not possible
[2017-03-27 14:30:29] <bill-auger> and again i can not imagine how such a mode is in any way useful
[2017-03-27 14:30:53] <InternetUnexplorer> Because sometimes people want to type things with multiple lines...? I find it very useful.
[2017-03-27 14:31:14] <bill-auger> but you said yourself that SHIFT-ENTER accomplishes that
[2017-03-27 14:31:34] <InternetUnexplorer> Yes, but if you're writing a long message it's easier to switch modes.
[2017-03-27 14:31:45] <InternetUnexplorer> To avoid accidentally posting everything.
[2017-03-27 14:31:52] <bill-auger> IF you actually know about these modes
[2017-03-27 14:32:11] <bill-auger> for someone who did not read the entire documentation - this will be confusing
[2017-03-27 14:32:22] <bill-auger> anyway i mean this not to complain as my personal opinion - its clearly  poor design - so to raise the issue so that maybe someone will give it a second look
[2017-03-27 14:33:03] <InternetUnexplorer> Fair enough. Though I would prefer if the feature wasn't removed entirely.
[2017-03-27 14:33:43] <bill-auger> it is very easy for developers being power-users themselves to forget how confusing their program may be to new users
[2017-03-27 14:34:09] <bill-auger> all they need to do is add a "SEND" button - problem solved
[2017-03-27 14:34:18] <bill-auger> a big fat one - not invisible
[2017-03-27 14:34:25] <bill-auger> done
[2017-03-27 15:54:34] <mariamelm2> 
[2017-03-27 18:03:35] <l_zilinski_twitter> can someone help me with my log in?
[2017-03-27 18:03:48] <l_zilinski_twitter> somehow _twitter is added to my log in
[2017-03-27 18:04:42] <l_zilinski_twitter> so my profile is broken
[2017-03-27 18:07:46] <cbj4074> l_zilinski_twitter: Log in with GitHub and not Twitter. Problem solved.
[2017-03-27 18:09:32] <andreykurilin> Hi again! Since there was no the answer to my original question, should repost it again - Is there anywhere linux-version of Gitter app packed in RPM package? I found only DEB-package
[2017-03-27 18:09:52] <l_zilinski_twitter> okay - i’ll try it
[2017-03-27 18:51:04] <mydigitalself> andreykurilin: not at the moment, you can run it yourself from source however: [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-28 02:09:46] <lipeiyan> gitter for windows not good
[2017-03-28 02:22:25] <InternetUnexplorer> lipeiyan: Thank you for yourincredibly detailedfeedback, is there anything in particular you would like to offer in terms of justification for your rating?
[2017-03-28 05:40:27] <grahamperrin> lipeiyan: is there a bug, or would you like to see a feature? Consider [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-28 11:03:54] <thzaw> Yes. I have to code small project
[2017-03-28 12:51:41] <dhcodes> hi all. A little while ago I asked if it was possible to send a private message via API and I now see that it is possible, but I have a question. Does the one-to-one room need to exist in order for this to be possible?I think it does based on this line:Create a Room
This is a private API. You need to use the Gitter ecosystem to create a room.from https://developer.gitter.im/docs/rooms-resource
[2017-03-28 12:52:33] <dhcodes> I don't seem to be able to post a message via a user's url (in place of room uri) if the room doesn't yet exist, or in other words if the one-to-one conversation hasn't already started
[2017-03-28 21:57:11] <sgehrman> Can't find the docs, very confused.  How do I setup a gitter room on a repository?  Why aren't there links to docs and simple instructions?
[2017-03-28 21:59:13] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @dhcodesYou need to create/join the room first and use the room ID in order to send a message. You can join the room via URI, [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-28 22:01:45] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/topics/topic/57f3912564f5e2a706b16605/gitter-communities-and-rooms
[2017-03-28 22:07:58] <sgehrman> ok, thanks.  You really need to make this simpler.  I couldn't find any instructions.
[2017-03-28 22:13:04] <sgehrman> Add people to this room doesn't work
[2017-03-28 22:14:21] <sgehrman> OK, how do I add people from github to a room.  The UI is incredibly confusing and broken
[2017-03-28 22:19:58] <MadLittleMods> sgehrman: There isn't a way to import people. What isn't working about the add people box in the chat area when you initially create the room?
[2017-03-28 22:20:14] <MadLittleMods> You can add people with the "Add" button under the roster in the right toolbar
[2017-03-28 22:21:39] <sgehrman> I think it might have worked when adding a person, but there was no feedback and I don't know what happened
[2017-03-28 22:22:11] <MadLittleMods> sgehrman: After clicking, it will change to "xxx added", see [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-28 22:23:34] <sgehrman> That People/Repo Info minimal 'tab' thing is stupid, make it look like a tab or something.
[2017-03-28 22:24:00] <sgehrman> I was trying to figure out why the Add button disappeared
[2017-03-28 22:25:07] <sgehrman> I didn't see that UI, I saw a list
[2017-03-28 22:26:01] <MadLittleMods> That UI will appear if there isn't anyone else in the room. Otherwise you need to invite people via "Add people to this room" modal which has a typeahead as you search
[2017-03-28 22:26:01] <sgehrman>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-28 22:26:31] <sgehrman> ok, well that's confusing
[2017-03-28 22:30:19] <sgehrman>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-28 22:30:51] <sgehrman> Is that suppose to show everyone added to a room? Or just online users?  I don't see the person I added there, but it seems that he was added to the github repository?
[2017-03-28 22:31:19] <sgehrman> how can I see all users added?
[2017-03-28 22:32:36] <dhcodes> MadLittleMods: Right, but one cannot create a room via the API, therefore I am just confirming that a oneToOne room must exist before you can send a DM via the api.
[2017-03-28 22:33:38] <MadLittleMods>  March 28, 2017 5:31 PM @sgehrman The roster will show everyone you added (up to 30 people, otherwise click the "See all" after that point like in this room). It looks like the user wasn't added.
[2017-03-28 22:34:13] <sgehrman> I don't see that UI, I select a user from the list, then it asks for their email address which I don't know.
[2017-03-28 22:34:42] <sgehrman> and I want to add others that don't show in that list, but I can't see how to do that.
[2017-03-28 22:35:35] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @dhcodesYou can create the room, that private note was a mistake, [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-03-28 22:36:25] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @sgehrmanIf they haven't signed up for Gitter, we have no way to know their email so you need to provide it. See recent related reply [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-28 22:37:22] <sgehrman> ok, well it's confusing that you show the person I want to add, then it doesn't add them and I have to enter an email address.  confusing.
[2017-03-28 22:37:43] <dhcodes> MadLittleMods: I'll send you a PM
[2017-03-28 22:37:59] <MadLittleMods> dhcodes: Please don't, let's move to [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-29 07:02:41] <grahamperrin> Again, a missing scroll bar.  Understatement: intensely annoying.
[2017-03-29 07:04:23] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-29 16:51:31] <MannikJ> Does anybody have issues with linking message timestamps via ALT+CLICK? It seems to be broken in chrome/desktop client. Firefox works fine. I am not the only one with problems. Edit: Firefox worked fine. Now also broken
[2017-03-29 16:56:17] <cbj4074> ^ He doesn't see any JS errors in the console, either. FWIW, it works for me in the Desktop client (Win 7).
[2017-03-29 16:56:42] <cbj4074> Gitter v3.1.0 (not on Next)
[2017-03-29 16:57:03] <cbj4074> What's your Gitter version,@MannikJ? And are you using Gitter Next?
[2017-03-29 16:57:15] <cbj4074> (Gitter Next would be checked in the Gitter application menu if so, and you'd have the greenNEXTbadge at the top of the UI)
[2017-03-29 17:00:07] <MannikJ> It makes no difference at all. Was also using v3.1.0. As I said, Firefox works randomly, but most of the time doesn't. Using Linux Mint 18.1
[2017-03-29 19:56:35] <grahamperrin> The missing scroll bar has reappeared. I wonder what causes it to sometimes not appear … if I can make it reproducible, I'll make an issue in GitHub.
[2017-03-29 19:57:19] <grahamperrin> MannikJ: does the issue affect rooms that you have joined? Or is it limited to rooms that you have not joined?
[2017-03-29 22:53:46] <elia> Is there any trick to scroll code blocks on iOS or is it a known bug ?
[2017-03-29 22:54:44] <InternetUnexplorer> I think it's a bug, scrolling works fine for me on Android.
[2017-03-30 06:16:57] <salfab> Hey guys,I just installed the gitter app for windows, and I think I typed the wrong github credentials password in during the OAuth process. Now, gitter asks for my permission (it does it anyways, despite the fact that my credentials were wrong) and when I click either deny or allow, the gitter window disappears. the process appears to be still running, though.
[2017-03-30 06:17:46] <salfab> is there a way to completely reset the typed-in credentials ? I tried uninstalling and re-installing it again, but the problem persists.
[2017-03-30 07:29:59] <AlexandreBonneau> Hi Gitter, is there any limitation to the chan avatar? I tried uploading a 256x256 png, but it just does not show up even after the small progress bar has completed its tasks
[2017-03-30 08:23:56] <mbrsalman5> Is there any new library for swipe listener animation?
[2017-03-30 11:20:28] <AlexandreBonneau> hello@mbrsalman5
[2017-03-30 11:20:52] <AlexandreBonneau> whoops, wrong chan, sorry
[2017-03-30 16:14:53] <kishorekaranam> Guys for a person with nil programming language... What would you suggest him to begin with and where?

[2017-03-30 18:12:03] <ModernFeelGames> Hi!
[2017-03-30 18:12:04] <hntd187> why does gitter on linux never shut down cleanly...ever?
[2017-03-30 18:12:23] <hntd187> I've used it on 4 different linux machines
[2017-03-30 18:12:34] <ModernFeelGames> Imma be honest, IDK, and its UBER annoying
[2017-03-30 18:12:48] <ModernFeelGames> I going to have to use windows again
[2017-03-30 18:12:55] <hntd187> now now
[2017-03-30 18:12:57] <ModernFeelGames> which isnt bad but...
[2017-03-30 18:12:58] <hntd187> let's not get ahead of ourselves
[2017-03-30 18:13:07] <ModernFeelGames> lol
[2017-03-30 18:13:11] <hntd187> it's annoying but it's not THAT annoying
[2017-03-30 18:14:20] <ModernFeelGames> I would like to at some point use that version of windows 10 home I bought to use, I currently only use it for visual studio.
[2017-03-30 18:17:23] <ModernFeelGames> Back on windows, nice to have it back!
[2017-03-30 18:25:56] <InternetUnexplorer> ModernFeelGames: @hntd187 [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-30 18:26:40] <ModernFeelGames> Who are you to say such a thing?
[2017-03-30 18:26:51] <ModernFeelGames> Admin?

[2017-03-30 18:27:54] <hntd187> he unexplores the internet
[2017-03-30 18:27:55] <hntd187> duh
[2017-03-30 18:28:07] <hntd187> what was explored is now not
[2017-03-30 18:28:35] <InternetUnexplorer> pretty much.
[2017-03-30 18:29:23] <ModernFeelGames> How are you supposed to say Hi, if you dont familiarize yourself, or as familiarizing yourself would mean saying hello, now youre stuck in a while(true) loop.
[2017-03-30 18:30:09] <InternetUnexplorer> Familiarizing yourself != Introducing yourself
[2017-03-30 18:30:17] <hntd187> Well Hi
[2017-03-30 18:30:19] <hntd187> I'm Steve
[2017-03-30 18:30:23] <hntd187> I'm a Scorpio
[2017-03-30 18:30:26] <grahamperrin> hntd187: back to support: the trouble that you have with Gitter on Linux, is the trouble with the official app? [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-30 18:30:39] <ModernFeelGames> But you cant say anything until you familiarize yourself
[2017-03-30 18:30:40] <hntd187> Yes@grahamperrin
[2017-03-30 18:31:05] <ModernFeelGames> I dont say hello, ok?
[2017-03-30 18:31:15] <ModernFeelGames> Im modern.
[2017-03-30 18:31:20] <ModernFeelGames> Thats all you get.
[2017-03-30 18:31:34] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-30 18:31:43] <ModernFeelGames> IK
[2017-03-30 18:31:45] <ModernFeelGames> IDC
[2017-03-30 18:31:59] <InternetUnexplorer> Thatis where your problem lies.
[2017-03-30 18:32:07] <hntd187> I'm confused, I can't tell if I'm breaking rules or not
[2017-03-30 18:32:35] <ModernFeelGames> It doesnt matter
[2017-03-30 18:32:57] <ModernFeelGames> why say hello? Cant you just be present?
[2017-03-30 18:33:03] <grahamperrin> Does anyone know, is the app for Linux Chromium-based?
[2017-03-30 18:33:25] <InternetUnexplorer> IIRC yes
[2017-03-30 18:34:31] <InternetUnexplorer> ModernFeelGames: It does matter when@grahamperrinbans you, head on over to gitterHQ/developers if you want useless chatter.
[2017-03-30 18:35:03] <ModernFeelGames> ok
[2017-03-30 18:35:28] <ModernFeelGames> I left this chatroom, but if someone mentions you it brings it back, thats dumb
[2017-03-30 18:35:31] <grahamperrin> Instead: the rhubarb room is – or should be – the place for chat that relates neither to support, nor software development.
[2017-03-30 18:36:36] <InternetUnexplorer> But developers is already meaningless. So many newbie web developers wandering around dejectedly on an empty plane of hope and despair...
[2017-03-30 18:36:52] <grahamperrin> Back to support, and trouble with the app: the best I can offer is that I have had trouble with Google Chrome and/or Chromium failing to quit on multiple platforms.
[2017-03-30 18:37:12] <hntd187> Chromium seems perfectly fine
[2017-03-30 18:37:21] <hntd187> I've at least had no problems there that I can notice
[2017-03-30 18:38:13] <hntd187> but it happens very consistently on multiple computers
[2017-03-30 18:38:47] <InternetUnexplorer> killall5 -9should stop the process. And some other processes. It'sreallygood at killing processes!
[2017-03-30 18:38:50] <grahamperrin> Clarification: [<-LINK->] and for issues with the app, [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-30 20:53:04] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @MannikJI permalink things a lot and have also seen it not work
[2017-03-30 20:56:49] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @salfabYou can editC:\Users\YOUR_USER\AppData\Local\Gitter/gitter_preferences.json->settings.tokendirectly. Also see [<-CODE->] 
[2017-03-30 20:59:54] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @AlexandreBonneauWhat community are you trying to upload for? I can try to see what failed on that transaction
[2017-03-30 21:00:36] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @grahamperrinYes, NW.js for linux
[2017-03-30 21:15:50] <AlexandreBonneau> MadLittleMods: autoNumeric/lobby
[2017-03-30 21:16:56] <AlexandreBonneau> also, how do you reply with a link to the context like that? :)
[2017-03-30 21:17:27] <MadLittleMods> AlexandreBonneau: Alt + Click the timestamp in the top right of every message
[2017-03-30 21:18:33] <AlexandreBonneau> ah bummer, being on LinuxAlt+clickis always already used by desktop environment to allow moving windows without having to select the title bar
[2017-03-30 21:18:48] <AlexandreBonneau> is there a way to rebind this feature?
[2017-03-30 21:19:32] <AlexandreBonneau> also, why not just quote it when clicking on it (withoutAlt)? :)
[2017-03-30 21:21:20] <MadLittleMods> AlexandreBonneau: No way to customize bindings atm. I'm not sure why Alt + Click was chosen. Clicking the timestamp will still change your address bar so you can grab the permalink URL there but it won't have the nicety markdown around it. One issue what that markdown anyway is the timezone is scoped to you for everyone
[2017-03-30 21:23:07] <AlexandreBonneau> ok, thanks
[2017-03-30 21:25:37] <MadLittleMods> AlexandreBonneau: It looks like we have a max size of 5MB on community avatars
[2017-03-30 21:26:08] <AlexandreBonneau> huh, I did not think to check the size
[2017-03-30 21:26:26] <MadLittleMods> AlexandreBonneau: Try uploading it again and I'll try to spot the request
[2017-03-30 21:26:38] <AlexandreBonneau> well, it's 26.7 Kio only
[2017-03-30 21:26:46] <AlexandreBonneau> ok, doing it now
[2017-03-30 21:27:25] <AlexandreBonneau> ok, it failed again
[2017-03-30 21:27:42] <AlexandreBonneau> I could saw the progress bar, then it reload the whole page
[2017-03-30 21:27:52] <AlexandreBonneau> once the progress bar was complete
[2017-03-30 21:28:55] <MadLittleMods> AlexandreBonneau: hmmm, [<-LINK->] , but I don't see it added to your group in the DB
[2017-03-30 21:29:32] <MadLittleMods> What does the network request say (in dev tools)?
[2017-03-30 21:29:34] <AlexandreBonneau> that link redirect to a login page
[2017-03-30 21:29:45] <MadLittleMods> AlexandreBonneau: (just an internal reference for me)
[2017-03-30 21:31:41] <AlexandreBonneau> I tried uploading it again while checking the network tab, but once it finished, it reloaded the page and hence the network log..
[2017-03-30 21:33:09] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] Your application was not yet notified about the results of this Assembly.
[2017-03-30 21:34:09] <AlexandreBonneau> ok
[2017-03-30 21:34:32] <AlexandreBonneau> am I alone reporting that bug? uploading an avatar seems to be pretty usual
[2017-03-30 21:37:36] <MadLittleMods> AlexandreBonneau: Lately, yes. And I just tested and it worked for me
[2017-03-30 21:38:15] <AlexandreBonneau> I'm using FF 54.0a2 (2017-03-29) (64 bits), could that be related?
[2017-03-30 21:40:14] <MadLittleMods> AlexandreBonneau: I don't think so. Because it is a 403 forbidden. It seems we can't see that you have write access to that community
[2017-03-30 21:41:09] <MadLittleMods> AlexandreBonneau: Looking at that community, onlyrhyekis an admin
[2017-03-30 21:41:28] <AlexandreBonneau> oh, that's wrong
[2017-03-30 21:41:53] <MadLittleMods> AlexandreBonneau: I assume you are an admin of some room but not a community admin
[2017-03-30 21:41:59] <AlexandreBonneau> he's the one who created the chan, I though it gave the admin role to BobKnoth, that gave it to me too. I'll contact him :)
[2017-03-30 21:42:10] <AlexandreBonneau> that's possible
[2017-03-30 21:42:52] <AlexandreBonneau> I did not know there was a difference between admin roles
[2017-03-30 21:43:41] <MadLittleMods> It looks like there is a bug on our end were we look for a room admin to show the avatar upload form. But we only accept the avatar if you are a community admin. Care to create an issue to track it? [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-30 23:04:20] <MadLittleMods> AlexandreBonneau: I've created an issue you can track [<-ISSUE->] and already have a fix pending review. But you will still need to be a community admin in order to upload something.
[2017-03-30 23:06:11] <BetKingIO> Hi. Is it possible to integrate Gitter into an ASP.NET website and use ASP.NET membership to allow login instead of Twitter/GitHub?
[2017-03-30 23:07:26] <MadLittleMods> BetKingIO: No, we only have GitHub/Twitter sign in at the moment. You can use Sidecar to put a Gitter room on your site though [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-30 23:08:28] <BetKingIO> I just looked at SideCar. It's great. The problem is that the majority of my users wouldn't have GitHub or Twitter accounts and I would be looking to allow their existing login details.
[2017-03-30 23:08:31] <BetKingIO> Thanks anyway
[2017-03-30 23:41:01] <AlexandreBonneau> MadLittleMods: thanks with the quick response! I'll see about those admin rights on my end

[2017-03-31 00:22:27] <AlexandreBonneau>  [<-LINK->] Yep,shift + ctrl + left clickworks under Kde
[2017-03-31 00:30:04] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-03-31 00:34:59] <AlexandreBonneau> well, I would not want to disable that very handful behavior, but thanks for the link anyway ;)
[2017-03-31 00:35:24] <grahamperrin> Shift-Control-Left click is not effective for me with Firefox 52.0.1 (64-bit) on KDE Plasma 4 on FreeBSD.The Alt-Control-Left click workaround is good.
[2017-03-31 00:36:13] <AlexandreBonneau> ah yes, I forgot to mention I'm using plasma 5 under Debian testing
[2017-03-31 00:40:38] <grahamperrin> The wordquotecurrently has multiple meanings. I suggest removing the(Alt-click to quote)hint; remove the second line of the popover.
[2017-03-31 00:41:28] <AlexandreBonneau> grahamperrin: I'm not a native english speaker, but I got what that meant. What bothers you in that hint?
[2017-03-31 00:42:42] <grahamperrin> Instead:add the second type of quote to the menu, to the right of the time stamp, that already includes the first type; and 
distinguish between the two.
[2017-03-31 00:47:14] <AlexandreBonneau> ah ok, I just got what you were referring too :)
[2017-03-31 00:47:43] <AlexandreBonneau> and yes indeed, using the same 'quote' name for two different actions is ambiguous
[2017-03-31 00:48:26] <grahamperrin> AlexandreBonneau: for a significant percentage of users it is, essentially, a bad hint. Also we have a bolt-on (Frankenstein) effect; I can't tell which of the two types of quote became a feature first. (I assume that the menu type of quote was the original, and that when the hint type of quote was added, the menu options were not updated.)
[2017-03-31 00:59:06] <grahamperrin> Aiming for thetimestamp reveals adate and timestamp, making the inferior stamp superfluous (no need for concurrent presentation of both stamps) whilst leaving a waste of space to the right of the post.Improvement suggestion [<-CODE->] 
[2017-03-31 01:04:44] <InternetUnexplorer>  March 30, 2017 5:42 PMThe word quote currently has multiple meanings. I suggest removing the (Alt-click to quote) hint; remove the second line of the popover.The differences are quite clear, I see no problem here.
[2017-03-31 01:05:11] <grahamperrin>  March 30, 2017 5:42 PMThe word quote currently has multiple meanings. I suggest removing the (Alt-click to quote) hint; remove the second line of the popover.The differences are quite clear, I see no problem here.

[2017-03-31 01:06:01] <grahamperrin> There: the differences become clear onlyafterexperimentation with quote then experimentation with quote.
[2017-03-31 01:07:04] <InternetUnexplorer> I didn't know about the alt+click for a really long time; it's not very obvious, so I don't think many users are confused about which one to use.And the differences are immediately obvious and clear when using the two, so there isn't much confusion there.
[2017-03-31 01:07:40] <InternetUnexplorer> Perhaps renaming it to "alt+click to point" or something...
[2017-03-31 01:08:03] <grahamperrin> Notimmediate. The differences between quote and quote become clear onlyafterusing both types.
[2017-03-31 01:09:34] <grahamperrin> For a significant percentage of users, Alt-Click… is, essentially, a bad hint.
[2017-03-31 01:10:01] <InternetUnexplorer> Yes immediate. I click the dropdown and I get this:I click the and I get this:
[2017-03-31 01:10:38] <InternetUnexplorer> Also, I doubt this will ever get changed at the rate they are responding to issues [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-03-31 01:11:32] <grahamperrin> Immediate clarity should be within the wording.
[2017-03-31 01:11:41] <InternetUnexplorer> Yes, thereadytag was added nearly 4 months ago.
[2017-03-31 02:40:17] <urbanikon> DOES ANYONE know py???
[2017-03-31 03:46:40] <wslongchen> yeah
[2017-03-31 03:46:58] <wslongchen> any question?
[2017-03-31 03:54:40] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @ben-wingEmails are tied to unreads at the moment and the "Announcement" setting has "Show unread item counts". You can track [<-ISSUE->] - You need to set those rooms to "Mute"
[2017-03-31 04:04:33] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] Here is how I think things could improve in this area:The quote function would quote the message and add the reference link to the bottom of the quote.
Add a reference/reply button that adds a proper reference pointer(similar to SE/SO) and leads to a sorta threaded discussion
[2017-03-31 05:49:08] <grahamperrin>  [<-CODE->] @MadLittleMods that will be a much better arrangement than what I first imagined. Thanks!
[2017-03-31 05:50:26] <GAJERAANIRUDDH_twitter> grahamperrin: sorry
[2017-03-31 05:53:39] <grahamperrin> GAJERAANIRUDDH_twitter: OK! Welcome, and I hope that you find an answer in one of the rooms.Hint: you can use the...menu (to the right of the time stamp) to delete your original post from this room, then I can delete my follow-up.
[2017-03-31 09:51:28] <AlexandreBonneau> quick question ; what can you do when someone created a community named after a Github project, and refuses to give the admin access to it neither to the owner nor the collaborators of said project?
[2017-03-31 09:52:17] <nickmccurdy> If it's not being used you might be able to get help from GitHub support
[2017-03-31 09:52:34] <AlexandreBonneau> github, for a gitter chan?
[2017-03-31 09:53:12] <nickmccurdy> Oh you mean just Gitter channels and not GitHub orgs/repos? My bad
[2017-03-31 09:53:35] <AlexandreBonneau> no problem :)
[2017-03-31 09:54:34] <AlexandreBonneau> I mean, shouldn't admin rights on gitter mirrors the ones on the repositories it's linked to?
[2017-03-31 17:02:25] <MadLittleMods> AlexandreBonneau: What community and what relation does the person who created the Gitter room have to the project?
[2017-03-31 19:20:49] <introwit> Any plans to update the Android app for gitter?
[2017-03-31 19:55:42] <InternetUnexplorer> introwit: yes, bugfixes and stuff, but AFAIK nothing is happening soon.
[2017-04-01 09:15:32] <jajie> no chinese?

[2017-04-01 12:45:02] <DutchOrdinary_twitter> grahamperrin: can you advice me the best room for the question i had im new on gitter
[2017-04-01 12:45:33] <grahamperrin> DutchOrdinary_twitter: have you browsed the list of rooms?
[2017-04-01 12:46:21] <DutchOrdinary_twitter> grahamperrin: yes but a lot rooms has only question but few answers
[2017-04-01 12:48:57] <grahamperrin> DutchOrdinary_twitter: if I recall correctly, your question was not about Gitter. What was the subject?
[2017-04-01 12:50:12] <DutchOrdinary_twitter> grahamperrin: the subject was im looking for nice library's that i can use to make a stencilgenerator in javascript and php.

[2017-04-01 13:10:10] <Frodox> So, there is still no colours in gitter. And [<-LINK->] - 404 :D
[2017-04-01 13:11:32] <grahamperrin> :-)
[2017-04-01 13:16:04] <grahamperrin> It was probably a typo.@Frodoxhave you found the proper link for issues?

[2017-04-01 14:33:11] <grahamperrin> Re: [<-LINK->] @alfredoabambresI guess that the waiting list forGitter Topics– [<-LINK->] – became private as part of the plan to open the source forGitter.
[2017-04-01 14:54:54] <grahamperrin> @suprememoocow at http://blog.gitter.im/2017/03/15/gitter-gitlab-acquisition/ when I clicked GitLab mailing list I expected on-screen information – from GitLab – about its list. Information; nothing more.Instead there's unexpected confirmation – from Gitter – of Signup for the GitLab Mailing List:

[2017-04-01 18:49:20] <alfredoabambres> grahamperrin: thanks for the reply. Any thoughts on the timeline for these (open the source of Gitter) to happen? When can we expect it to be open again (Topics)? Thanks again.

[2017-04-01 18:58:17] <grahamperrin> alfredoabambres: please revisit the post by GitLab, in particular:

[2017-04-01 19:02:22] <alfredoabambres> it will be worth the wait. thank
[2017-04-02 00:46:24] <darsparx> sighthe irc connection is still super unstable...not like I really use it(since I'm not far enough to help with or be involved with programming but still annoying to see it happen XD)
[2017-04-02 00:47:05] <darsparx> and it's definitely just gitter since freenode has no issues except maybe once every two weeks or so >_>
[2017-04-02 08:18:54] <grahamperrin> I do think that the Zendesk-based support area is far from ideal.
[2017-04-02 08:20:13] <grahamperrin> My gut feeling: excessive numbers of categories and sub-categories.
[2017-04-02 08:32:55] <grahamperrin> tahirkhan0332: is your question about GitHub, or Gitter?
[2017-04-02 08:33:12] <tahirkhaan> its about github

[2017-04-02 08:36:00] <tahirkhaan> grahamperrin: its about gitthub

[2017-04-02 08:37:06] <tahirkhaan> ok sir
[2017-04-02 08:37:38] <grahamperrin> The orientation will help you to find the appropriate room.
[2017-04-02 12:27:15] <grahamperrin> ajit101010: do you have a Gitter support-related question?
[2017-04-02 14:35:01] <Brohx> Can I ask what are the mainly difference about discord and gitter?
[2017-04-02 14:40:13] <grahamperrin> Brohx:  [<-LINK->] describes Discord asvoice and text chat for gamers.
[2017-04-02 14:40:26] <Brohx> so, gitter is the same but for programming?
[2017-04-02 14:40:41] <Brohx> because in discord there are server for everything too
[2017-04-02 14:41:08] <grahamperrin> No, quite different. Gitter is not for audible speech.
[2017-04-02 14:41:20] <Brohx> ok
[2017-04-02 14:41:31] <Brohx> what are the better functionality in gitter
[2017-04-02 14:41:49] <grahamperrin> Have you browsed the support site?
[2017-04-02 14:42:13] <Brohx> no
[2017-04-02 14:42:32] <Brohx> grahamperrin: are there bot in gitter?
[2017-04-02 14:44:31] <grahamperrin> Some rooms do appear to have bots.
[2017-04-02 14:44:43] <Brohx> ok
[2017-04-02 14:45:00] <grahamperrin> Have you browsed the rooms?
[2017-04-02 14:45:12] <Brohx> I will.
[2017-04-02 19:52:37] <grahamperrin> darsparx: please, can you describe the instability? Do any of the issues at [<-LINK->] or [<-LINK->] relate to your experience?
[2017-04-03 00:16:38] <fchpr> Hello there, a question here: is it a possible way to restrict comments of a public room only to certain admins? Like a non-chatting News board room... Thanks in advance,
[2017-04-03 00:22:05] <MadLittleMods> sietedosfede: no, you can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-04-03 00:24:01] <fchpr> MadLittleMods: Oh I hope it gets accomplished some day, I find it a utterly necessary feature for organizations. Thanks for the information.
[2017-04-03 00:26:32] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @alfredoabambresTopics has only been rolled out to a select few communities who iniitally signed up and we are still in beta. There isn't a way to sign up now
[2017-04-03 00:33:43] <fchpr> MadLittleMods: Ouch. We at CaFeLUG (Linux User Group from Capital Federal, Argentina) are trying to make sort of CMS which makes use of embebbed Gitter chat at [<-LINK->] If we could register a non-commentable room it would be great. Anyway thanks for the response.
[2017-04-03 02:01:11] <InternetUnexplorer> 
[2017-04-03 02:05:22] <InternetUnexplorer> Gitter really needs a tutorial which points out the basic parts of the interface.
[2017-04-03 02:25:06] <grahamperrin> Meta: it's disorienting when deletion of a post is followed by automated scrolling to far away from the point of deletion. I don't imagine an easy fix.
[2017-04-03 02:26:24] <grahamperrin> Meta: let's hope that across the bridge to IRC, no-one has the nameMeta
[2017-04-03 02:36:02] <InternetUnexplorer> Haha, I'm sure@Metawon't mind.
[2017-04-03 02:36:13] <InternetUnexplorer> Thanks for the tips/links!
[2017-04-03 07:55:15] <anddam> hello, is it possible to search in a channel history?
[2017-04-03 08:27:21] <mydigitalself> anddam: yes, the search icon on the left will show results from the currently open channel. you can also search google for any public conversation
[2017-04-03 08:36:34] <anddam> ah thanks
[2017-04-03 08:50:17] <anddam> mydigitalself: do you happen to know if there's a string search, exactly matching a sentence the way it is, e.g. "foo bar baz"?
[2017-04-03 08:51:26] <mydigitalself> yeah, exactly that, inverted commas for a phrase
[2017-04-03 08:59:49] <anddam> thestraighttype, right?
[2017-04-03 09:00:45] <anddam> btw I'm not an English speaker, this is the first time I met the saying "inverted commas" for quotation marks, in fact I had to search for that
[2017-04-03 09:04:52] <mydigitalself> you learn something new every day ;)
[2017-04-03 09:10:42] <anddam> thanks again
[2017-04-03 09:10:44] <anddam> see yuo
[2017-04-03 09:10:47] <anddam> you*
[2017-04-03 13:24:31] <salfab> MadLittleMods: Awesome ! Thank you very much, you're a real life saver !
[2017-04-03 18:30:56] <PiyaliCc> apologies@grahamperrin..misunderstood with "FreeCodeCamp Gitter hub... thank you anyway.
[2017-04-03 18:58:38] <grahamperrin> OK, I'll clear the questions. If you need it: [<-LINK->] 
[2017-04-03 21:28:52] <AlexandreBonneau>  [<-LINK->] this is for theautoNumeric/Lobbychannel, created by a former contributor to theautoNumeric/autoNumericgithub project for which I'm one of the two maintainer
[2017-04-03 21:29:33] <AlexandreBonneau> I would have liked to be able to manage it (and change it toautoNumeric/autoNumeric), to no avail unfortunately
[2017-04-03 23:56:11] <landoE> Hi, I have a quick question. How do I post a picture in the comments so someone can see what i'm talking about?
[2017-04-03 23:57:29] <InternetUnexplorer> Use ![](url) or drag the file into your browser to upload it.
[2017-04-03 23:57:52] <landoE> InternetUnexplorer: Thank you!
[2017-04-04 02:48:58] <InternetUnexplorer> @243750496 Hello.If you're new, it's always best to introduce yourself and ask your question politely immediately. Don't just say "hello" and expect everyone to take time out of their life to say "hello" back.
[2017-04-04 02:51:17] <InternetUnexplorer> What has changed since you last asked?
[2017-04-04 02:53:31] <InternetUnexplorer> No, it's just that no one has had the time to answer it yet.Please delete your question you just posted, and [<-LINK->] 
[2017-04-04 02:55:53] <InternetUnexplorer> Well, if you've already done that, then wait for them to reply.Gitter is run by a small team, and they have a lot to do. If they haven't responded within two weeks, try contacting them directly here.
[2017-04-04 02:57:34] <InternetUnexplorer> MadLittleMods and mydigitalself are often in this room. If all else fails, you can try contacting them.
[2017-04-04 02:58:30] <243750496> Got it
[2017-04-04 18:02:17] <jhonlml> Hello, can someone please tell me where can I find the Gitter source to install on Manjaro?
[2017-04-04 18:05:44] <jhonlml> Sorry, I just saw the Gitter + GitLab article, thanks
[2017-04-04 18:06:06] <luzfcb> hello, how to force not render a gist link?
[2017-04-04 18:11:28] <mydigitalself> luzfcb: you can't at the moment i'm afraid
[2017-04-04 18:18:48] <luzfcb> if a gist file is "big", the gitter preview can confuse, and people may end up not opening the link to see the complete file.
[2017-04-04 18:22:21] <mydigitalself> yeah, i can understand why, it's something we want to do in the future
[2017-04-04 20:39:59] <AlexandreBonneau> MadLittleMods: moreover, I see on the left hand side pane under 'Your organisations' theautoNumericone, and when I click on it it saysThe room autoNumeric does not yet exist. Do you want to create it?, but clickingcreatedoes not do anything
[2017-04-04 20:40:56] <AlexandreBonneau> (also, while fiddling with theautoNumeric/lobbychannel, I managed to remove myself and Bob from the room admin rights, whoops ;))
[2017-04-04 23:13:51] <lexicalunit> I'm trying to create a gitter for a repository however when I do it keeps saying "Allow Private repo access on the GitHub org..." and won't let me do this. The repo isn't part of a GH org at all so there's no way I can do this. I am a member of some GH orgs but the repo I'm trying to create a gitter for isn't part of those orgs. Currently I've authorized Gitter public repo access with permissions to 1) Read org and team membership and 2) Access user email addresses (read-only). Any ideas what is going on here?
[2017-04-05 08:12:51] <mydigitalself> lexicalunit: what exactly are you trying to do, can you share screenshot perhaps?
[2017-04-05 15:13:12] <foxjazz> I think they should add a feature to gitter that us lines to point to responses
[2017-04-05 15:14:44] <InternetUnexplorer> foxjazz: alt+click the timestamp.
[2017-04-05 15:15:18] <foxjazz>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-04-05 15:16:47] <foxjazz> mydigitalself: testing... see if there was a line between this message and 4 above
[2017-04-05 15:19:12] <InternetUnexplorer> grahamperrin: ban?
[2017-04-05 15:28:13] <kaonashiHF> ?
[2017-04-05 15:28:54] <lexicalunit> mydigitalself: sure:
[2017-04-05 15:29:42] <lexicalunit> Somehow gitter is detecting my public repo as private or as belonging to an org. It's isn't, it's not. Gitter is confused.
[2017-04-05 15:30:56] <lexicalunit> Gitter already has all the permissions it needs to work with the repo.
[2017-04-05 15:34:46] <kaonashiHF> 
[2017-04-05 15:35:17] <lexicalunit> /ban@kaonashiHF
[2017-04-05 15:49:34] <lexicalunit> I have to admit, the fact that we can't ignore/hide/block a user is pretty shitty.
[2017-04-05 15:49:49] <kaonashiHF> dont worry its for the greater good roastie
[2017-04-05 15:50:02] <lexicalunit> lol
[2017-04-05 15:56:14] <mydigitalself> on it
[2017-04-05 16:00:07] <lexicalunit> Much better.
[2017-04-05 16:03:57] <mydigitalself> lexicalunit: i think you are getting an incorrect error message. at the moment, we "share" GitHub's namespace, so you can't havegitter.im/nanodbcas your url as there's already a github account with that name.
[2017-04-05 16:06:25] <lexicalunit> hrm, so I just need to change the name?
[2017-04-05 16:06:59] <mydigitalself> you can keep the name, just change the url
[2017-04-05 16:07:39] <lexicalunit> ah, right
[2017-04-05 16:07:53] <lexicalunit> Yeah that seems to work. Good enough! Thanks :)
[2017-04-05 16:08:58] <mydigitalself> cool :)
[2017-04-05 16:41:20] <cbj4074> Is there any way to determine if a disruptive individual is a bot/using the API to post messages?
[2017-04-05 17:13:03] <mydigitalself> there isn't, no - someone you have in mind?
[2017-04-05 17:27:27] <cbj4074> mydigitalself: Thanks... not just yet. He might be a person.
[2017-04-05 17:28:08] <cbj4074> But he pastes the same large code snippets repeatedly, and has been doing so for a few days now. I questioned him directly and he responded, so, maybe he's a real person.
[2017-04-05 17:28:37] <mydigitalself> cbj4074: you got a link to one his messages?
[2017-04-05 18:55:38] <stevoisiak> Greetings. I wanted to know if the Gitter desktop app for Windows is 32-bit or 64-bit. I'd like to install it toProgram Filesinstead ofAppData
[2017-04-05 18:56:17] <stevoisiak> I'm not sure whether it belongs inProgram FilesorProgram Files (x86)
[2017-04-05 19:23:51] <cbj4074> Stevoisiak: You can tell by examining the process in the Task Manager. There is a*32next to any 32-bit process.
[2017-04-05 19:24:14] <cbj4074> I just looked and it is 32.
[2017-04-05 19:24:34] <stevoisiak> cbj4074: Thanks. Wanted to figure that out before I installed it
[2017-04-05 19:24:49] <cbj4074> Stevoisiak: 
[2017-04-05 19:24:53] <stevoisiak> Why doesn't Gitter install to Program Files by default anyway?
[2017-04-05 19:25:46] <cbj4074> Because it's probably not designed to be installed globally. Not positive, but my guess is that it stores user-specific data (like your authentication token) with the app.
[2017-04-05 19:26:03] <cbj4074> So, if you install it to a location that is accessible to all users on the system, any of them will be able to fire it up and login as you.
[2017-04-05 19:26:26] <cbj4074> If I'm wrong, somebody qualified will probably correct me shortly. :D
[2017-04-05 19:39:03] <ghost~56835aa516b6c7089cc090e9> hello my name is drew lemmy

[2017-04-05 19:39:14] <ghost~56835aa516b6c7089cc090e9> how can i fix this
[2017-04-05 19:39:29] <ghost~56835aa516b6c7089cc090e9>  [<-LINK->] is not stupid
[2017-04-05 19:40:44] <cbj4074> LOL. How'd that happen?
[2017-04-05 19:40:54] <ghost~56835aa516b6c7089cc090e9> i am really not sure

[2017-04-05 20:21:19] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @AlexandreBonneauThe "Your Organisations" section doesn't work anymore, [<-LINK->] - I addedrhyekback as an admin because they were an admin of the group
[2017-04-05 20:22:40] <AlexandreBonneau> MadLittleMods: , well, the point was thatrhyekis not part of the autoNumeric organisation, and created theautoNumeric/lobbywithout giving us the community rights :/
[2017-04-05 20:23:26] <MadLittleMods> AlexandreBonneau: Can you make your org membership public? [<-LINK->] 
[2017-04-05 20:23:52] <AlexandreBonneau> ah, it's not?
[2017-04-05 20:23:56] <AlexandreBonneau> fixing that
[2017-04-05 20:27:02] <AlexandreBonneau> done
[2017-04-05 20:28:33] <AlexandreBonneau> so my question is, is it possible to renameautoNumeric/LobbytoautoNumeric/autoNumeric, get the channel and community rights back to the autoNumeric organisation owners, and do not lose the log history from that chan? :)
[2017-04-05 20:31:46] <MadLittleMods> AlexandreBonneau: You are now an admin of the room and group. [<-LINK->] is ready to go
[2017-04-05 20:32:22] <AlexandreBonneau> MadLittleMods: thanks!
[2017-04-06 10:07:45] <Frodox> Is it possible to cast user though activity..? I want to cast myself via monitoring tool in case of some fatal error

[2017-04-06 10:10:34] <Frodox> ah.. :(
[2017-04-06 10:10:40] <Frodox> any plans?
[2017-04-06 10:10:56] <mydigitalself> not in the short-term, but it's something we'd like to do in the future
[2017-04-07 01:04:13] <good-stuey> hello everyone
[2017-04-07 01:06:11] <LWSS> is gitter even open source? Why hasn't anyone added user-blocking/muting for over 3 years
[2017-04-07 01:06:32] <InternetUnexplorer> LWSS: No, it's not open source. There have been several announcements about this.
[2017-04-07 01:06:49] <InternetUnexplorer> It will be open sourced later this year.
[2017-04-07 01:07:03] <InternetUnexplorer> good-stuey: Hello, what is your Gitter support question?
[2017-04-07 01:09:09] <LWSS> Honestly even if it's a shitty clientside block, it would be like 10 lines of code
[2017-04-07 01:10:00] <InternetUnexplorer> Well then, do it yourself.
[2017-04-07 01:10:27] <InternetUnexplorer> I'm not trying to sound rude, it's just that the Gitter team is very busy nowadays
[2017-04-07 01:11:02] <InternetUnexplorer> There's already an issue on GitHub if you look for it.
[2017-04-07 01:11:27] <LWSS> yeah I know, I commented in it when that dude was shitposting
[2017-04-07 12:36:45] <cbj4074> Yeah, I sympathize. I'm getting tired of it, too.
[2017-04-07 16:48:57] <kapilkd13> Hi all, I have a doubt, If I sent a message to someone and then deleted it before he read it, would it still be delivered. Thanks
[2017-04-07 16:53:23] <InternetUnexplorer> kapilkd13: It is not possible to read a deleted message, no.
[2017-04-07 16:56:06] <kapilkd13> Thanks@InternetUnexplorer
[2017-04-07 17:01:05] <grahamperrin> Consider the possibility that notification of the message was sent, via e-mail, before deletion of the message.
[2017-04-07 17:05:18] <kapilkd13> Is there a fixed time we wait before sendingunread messagemail
[2017-04-07 17:06:12] <MadLittleMods> kapilkd13: Yes, 1 hour
[2017-04-07 17:07:24] <kapilkd13> That's great. i deleted within minutes
[2017-04-07 17:09:55] <MadLittleMods> kapilkd13: There is still a possibility an email was sent because we pull the latest messages but could be triggered by older unread messages in the room. They could of read it in the desktop notification without marking it as read. They could also have the Android, iOS app setup and we sent a push notification that they may see before it gets dismissed.
[2017-04-08 00:43:55] <JohnLuckyBlue> I love the ability to delete an email after I send it... and have it deleted from the receiving account too. That way if I made a mistake, it's fixable.
[2017-04-08 00:45:37] <cbj4074> Who's your email provider? AOL? :P
[2017-04-08 00:45:44] <cbj4074> Those were the good ol' days.
[2017-04-08 00:46:17] <cbj4074> You could see when it was read, too!
[2017-04-08 00:47:41] <JohnLuckyBlue> cbj4074: Ha!It's awesome.You can do it on Skype & some other platforms, too, but I'm hoping for it to appear on things like Gmail. I make lots of mistakes!;p
[2017-04-08 00:48:28] <cbj4074> 
[2017-04-08 00:48:49] <cbj4074> It's like setting a 5-second delay on your text messages.
[2017-04-08 00:48:58] <cbj4074> Cancel-cancel-cancel!!!
[2017-04-08 00:56:20] <LWSS> You can delete emails after they're sent?Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
[2017-04-08 01:15:03] <grahamperrin> Folks, please consider shifting to [<-LINK->] for chat that does not relate directly to support. Thanks.
[2017-04-08 01:18:11] <JohnLuckyBlue> grahamperrin: Thanks Graham!
[2017-04-08 01:34:58] <cbj4074> Yep, good call! Sorry!
[2017-04-08 05:09:39] <nagasrinu565> hi..
[2017-04-08 05:45:52] <grahamperrin> nagasrinu565: please let us have your Gitter support question.
[2017-04-08 09:15:26] <NiclasOlofsson> Are there any plans of adding moderating features beyond /ban to gitter?
[2017-04-08 09:15:37] <NiclasOlofsson> (like mute)
[2017-04-08 10:26:05] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->]  Issues with Gitter  you'll find a few matches formute…
[2017-04-08 10:31:40] <NiclasOlofsson> yeah, i know what you mean@grahamperrin, but since it is ignored since 2014 i thought I'd just ask. Running gitter in a community full of 11-14 year Minecraft wannabe developers is pretty difficult/rough when the only tool you have is /ban.
[2017-04-08 10:40:34] <grahamperrin> I don't imagine that it's ignored.
[2017-04-08 10:43:28] <NiclasOlofsson> Well, it's not like we paying for the services of gitter so I guess we can't really complain much about it.
[2017-04-08 13:05:16] <LWSS> Yeah honestly, it's just too hard of a feature to add.The gitter team just can't seem to wrap their head around it.Real stumped on this one.
[2017-04-08 13:28:20] <grahamperrin> LWSS: there's the predefined set of things to be prioritised after the transition of Gitter to open source.Parallel to the countdown to open source: there's an initiative that may present an opportunity for concerned users to be more proactive; for the Gitter developers to be less burdened. If this opportunity does arise – maybe within the next few days – I'll post something to this room.
[2017-04-08 13:54:18] <LWSS> So you're saying that the users should take a crack at it? I'm not sure they're up for that, if the experts can't figure it out, we're screwed.
[2017-04-08 22:29:56] <TitouanT> hello, there is an issue with the code dislaying: the font is not a fixed width one (I want to share some ascci art with my friends on gitter :D)
[2017-04-08 23:07:06] <InternetUnexplorer> TitouanT: the font is fixed width.Are you sure you are properly formatting it?
[2017-04-08 23:32:44] <TitouanT> InternetUnexplorer: here is an example:
[2017-04-08 23:32:59] <TitouanT>  [<-CODE->] 
[2017-04-08 23:33:29] <TitouanT> this is a representation of a binary tree
[2017-04-08 23:34:44] <TitouanT> maybe this is from my browser because as I see it, the characters are not correctly alined
[2017-04-08 23:35:01] <InternetUnexplorer> TitouanT: looks misaligned on my side as well.
[2017-04-08 23:35:39] <InternetUnexplorer> Specifically, it seems the┬character is out of line.
[2017-04-08 23:39:29] <TitouanT> I found a clearer example because it's true the box charachter are a bit special, and this time no space so we can see all the charachter:
[2017-04-08 23:39:36] <TitouanT>  [<-CODE->] 
[2017-04-09 00:00:25] <DavidDudson> It's perfect on the Gitter iOS app if that's any help

[2017-04-09 14:35:45] <BartBucknill> grahamperrin: I found [<-ISSUE->] which was a request to rename community. Is opening an issue the right thing to do as far as you know? I have searched the topics, faqs and documentation earlier but didn’t find anything.
[2017-04-09 14:48:26] <grahamperrin> I guess so. If you raise it as an issue it will appear as an activity in the sidebar here.
[2017-04-09 14:48:55] <BartBucknill> Thanks 
[2017-04-09 23:58:21] <rbuckland> Does anyone have a solution or suggestion toHi peoples .. sometimes (once every few weeks), some of our private channels go "blank" for me on the iPhone. I thought it might be an iOS 8 thing. So I upgraded to iPhone 7 iOS 10. However I am experiencing the same issue. Not all channels - some still work. Only way I i have found to fix it is to delete the app and reinstall.
[2017-04-10 01:03:41] <grahamperrin> rbuckland: please refrain from repetition/bumping. I'll delete your earlier post.
[2017-04-10 09:37:03] <keradus> Hi all.I know that topics are in beta state and ETA is not yet released.I would like to ask is the concept not dropped, and if not, is there a way to use that beta-feature in private channels ?
[2017-04-10 09:53:06] <mydigitalself> keradus: we can enable it for you if you give us the url of the community
[2017-04-10 10:08:35] <keradus> great to hear@mydigitalself, organisation is [<-LINK->] , would it work for all conversations under that organisations ?
[2017-04-10 10:13:45] <mydigitalself> it sits at the community level - e.g. if you visit [<-LINK->] you can see them
[2017-04-10 10:15:05] <keradus> is it possible to make it also for given room, eg forgitterHQ/gitter?
[2017-04-10 10:22:19] <mydigitalself> it's not, no
[2017-04-10 10:22:39] <keradus> ok, thanks ;)
[2017-04-10 10:23:42] <mydigitalself> i'll get it activated for you tomorrow
[2017-04-10 10:34:32] <keradus> cool

[2017-04-10 17:47:47] <jash101> arch-master: link to gitter's repo
[2017-04-10 17:49:19] <arch-master> jash101: Hmmm... I just looked around some more. It seems that Gitter isn't open-source.

[2017-04-11 05:29:46] <grahamperrin> Dthoughts09_twitter: were you a Twitter user when you attempted to join the Gitter room for Free Code Camp?
[2017-04-11 05:43:32] <MadLittleMods> @Dthoughts09_twitter Per the message at the bottom when you view that room, "Only GitHub users can join this room." [<-CODE->] 
[2017-04-11 07:43:50] <Dthoughts09_twitter> Ohhhh okay I see thanks guys@MadLittleMods@grahamperrin
[2017-04-11 08:54:35] <grahamperrin> Yeah … here's [<-LINK->] from [<-LINK->] .That particular expedition was slightly exaggerated :-) but still, it may go towards a shared understanding of some of the reasons for disoriented newcomers posting to the wrong room.
[2017-04-11 08:56:35] <LWSS> ur window manager sux
[2017-04-11 08:57:07] <grahamperrin> LWSS: please describe the problem.
[2017-04-11 09:00:56] <LWSS> It looks bad, it's yellow, and the font is horrible
[2017-04-11 09:08:29] <grahamperrin> Please be more descriptive. What's yellow? Which Gitter room? A link will help.

[2017-04-11 09:12:07] <grahamperrin> LWSS: from the post before yours: "… posting to the wrong room. …"
[2017-04-11 09:12:33] <grahamperrin> Gitter does not develop that window manager.
[2017-04-11 09:15:42] <grahamperrin> One thing yellow, a smiley:

[2017-04-11 14:13:37] <vdeturckheim> is there any moderator I can talk to ? :)
[2017-04-12 09:09:42] <grahamperrin> vdeturckheim: if your Gitter support issue is not confidential, please address it question to the room.
[2017-04-12 09:11:09] <vdeturckheim> grahamperrin: Thanks, I'd rather not do it publicly :/
[2017-04-12 09:23:17] <grahamperrin> Thanks for clarifying. I imagine that a person with suitably elevated privileges (that's not me) will read your lines and send you a private message. Such people are present in this room but I don't know their 'times of day'.
[2017-04-12 09:25:07] <grahamperrin> Side note: if the green circle is to indicate that someone is online, I'm surprised to find myself the one and only person online at 10:24 (UK time) on a Wednesday morning.
[2017-04-12 09:25:13] <vdeturckheim> thanks :) it is weird that there is no quick solutions to get a mod in some rooms. I've been insulted in another gitterHQ room yesterday and still nothing has been done :(
[2017-04-12 09:26:26] <keradus> if it's one timer be above it and don't waste your time ;)
[2017-04-12 09:27:41] <vdeturckheim> keradus: it is more to have this person prevented from doing it again to someone else. The guy went far. He even created a fake github account to make PR talking about gross stuff in my repos.
[2017-04-12 09:27:53] <grahamperrin> Hmm, there's an old bug (an issue in GitHub) that causes the list of people tonotlist all people.@keradusand/or@vdeturckheimdo you know what's meant by the amber badges on your avatars?
[2017-04-12 09:28:12] <vdeturckheim> no :(
[2017-04-12 09:28:37] <keradus> then you could report gh user to gh as well ;Pnope
[2017-04-12 09:28:46] <grahamperrin> vdeturckheim: there was recent abuse in this room from someone who apparently created a GitHub account for the sole purpose of abusing this room. It was discussed with a moderator.
[2017-04-12 09:29:20] <vdeturckheim> keradus: i had the fake account deleted, but his original account has not been ^^
[2017-04-12 09:31:04] <vdeturckheim> grahamperrin: I see. anyway, I still would like to see if it is possible to remove the consideration this person made about my sexual orientation or his intercourses with my mother from that other room.
[2017-04-12 12:44:35] <cbj4074> Those amber/green statuses don't work (and never have).
[2017-04-12 12:48:46] <LWSS> Yeah dude that definitely was me
[2017-04-12 12:49:49] <LWSS> "I was confronted with a different opinion in my safe-space" Mods!
[2017-04-12 15:23:13] <vdeturckheim> is it possible to have some kind of moderation on gitterHQ/nodejs for the life of me? someone just posted gross pictures
[2017-04-12 15:24:48] <cbj4074> That is really obnoxious... this trolling is out-of-hand, Gitter staff.
[2017-04-12 15:25:05] <cbj4074> Many of us are working professionals here. It's unacceptable that there is no ability to moderate that kind of filth.
[2017-04-12 15:25:05] <LWSS> block feature is just too hard for them
[2017-04-12 15:25:16] <LWSS> display: none;
[2017-04-12 15:25:42] <vdeturckheim> also,@LWSS's case should be discussed
[2017-04-12 15:26:25] <LWSS>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-04-12 15:26:34] <LWSS> you mean this case?
[2017-04-12 15:32:55] <vdeturckheim> thanks for helping me making a point
[2017-04-12 15:37:18] <cbj4074> Anybody know where that GitHub ticket is, regarding the lack of appropriate moderation tools?
[2017-04-12 15:37:45] <LWSS>  [<-ISSUE->] bookmarked :^)
[2017-04-12 15:51:29] <mydigitalself> we added other moderation tools a while ago, including the ability for admins to delete messages and to set other admins, even if they aren't part of the GitHub org
[2017-04-12 15:51:53] <mydigitalself> but the problem has certainly been growing and we'll look to do some self-moderation soon
[2017-04-12 15:53:49] <mydigitalself> personal moderation is a bit more tricksy, it's not just a case of display:none, there are a few other considerations
[2017-04-12 15:54:32] <LWSS> i'm saying a block feature would be nice
[2017-04-12 15:54:43] <mydigitalself> yeah, that's what i mean by personal moderation
[2017-04-12 15:54:48] <LWSS> I should be able to click the three dots next to your name and block
[2017-04-12 15:54:49] <mydigitalself> i.e. it's not global, it's just for you
[2017-04-12 15:55:03] <mydigitalself> with room-wide moderation it's easy, we just ban the user and don't let them in
[2017-04-12 15:57:00] <mydigitalself> per user moderation you can't justif user is blocked then display:nonethe messages, you need to maintain a per user blocked collection, make sure that new messages from that user doesn't create events (e.g. push notifications, aren't marked as unread - that's the tricksier bit) and then when you retrieve a list of messages from the API, not return those messages at all to that specific user.
[2017-04-12 15:58:17] <mydigitalself> i.e. you want to do it at the cloud level, not on the client level
[2017-04-12 15:59:23] <mydigitalself> that means every message that gets sent in a room, you need to process the entire room membership collection and traverse that for blocked users then perform user-specific logic
[2017-04-12 16:06:55] <cbj4074> There's no question that it's a complicated problem. As I suggested in the aforementioned thread, why not just let client disable automatic image/video previews? That would solve a large part of the problem.
[2017-04-12 16:07:25] <cbj4074> And then you can work on the more complex aspects... but something needs to be done, like, now.
[2017-04-12 16:10:16] <LWSS>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-04-12 16:10:57] <InternetUnexplorer> but something needs to be done, like, now.Agreed. I understand that Gitter is run by a very small team, and that they have a lot of work to do right now (going open source), but the lack of any sort of noticeable progress on this issue is increasingly worrying.
[2017-04-12 16:12:53] <InternetUnexplorer> An example of work on resolving issues slowing to a halt (although not spam related) is [<-ISSUE->] . It's less than a one line CSS fix, which was marked asreadyoverfour monthsago.
[2017-04-12 16:25:14] <Kunepro> Hi, I was trying to create a room for the "Angular" community, but I press the button and nothing happens, I check the console and: [<-CODE->] I'm not a member of the "Angular" team. I need to be a member of "Angular" to create separate room for that community? There's a lack of UX possibly due to that error. Yes, I tried to refresh the page.
[2017-04-12 16:25:37] <Kunepro> that error trigger every time I type on the name input form or click "create"
[2017-04-12 16:29:17] <mydigitalself> seems to be a bug, normally you should get a UI error
[2017-04-12 16:30:16] <Kunepro> I'm using Chrome, and it's updated, so weird. Also I'm working from home, so there are no wierd corporate proxy/ firewall
[2017-04-12 16:30:18] <mydigitalself> InternetUnexplorer: our priorities changed considerably with the GitLab acquisition, so a lot has been put on hold whilst we're trying to integrate into the company
[2017-04-12 16:31:19] <cbj4074> Peoples' wallets' priorities are going to change very soon if this isn't addressed...
[2017-04-12 16:31:29] <InternetUnexplorer> cbj4074: It's free.
[2017-04-12 16:31:46] <InternetUnexplorer> Don't try to pull the "I paid good money for this" card when you didn't.
[2017-04-12 16:31:48] <cbj4074> Not in every instance; there are people who pay for private channels.
[2017-04-12 16:32:04] <InternetUnexplorer> They haven't for the past few months.
[2017-04-12 16:32:20] <InternetUnexplorer> They got refunded IIRC.
[2017-04-12 16:32:42] <cbj4074> So what's the business model?
[2017-04-12 16:32:49] <cbj4074> How does anybody make money?
[2017-04-12 16:33:02] <mydigitalself> nobody pays for private channels, they are all free now
[2017-04-12 16:33:27] <cbj4074> Good to know... look, I'm a Gitter advocate and champion the service and cause. This ain't haters hatin'.
[2017-04-12 16:33:33] <LWSS> So is the Gitter server going to be open source too?
[2017-04-12 16:33:40] <mydigitalself> yes exactly@LWSS
[2017-04-12 16:33:54] <mydigitalself> everything will be OSS
[2017-04-12 20:05:29] <grahamperrin> InternetUnexplorer: @schas002FYI [<-ISSUE->] my recollection of the keywordmobilearises from theAndroid-related issue that is cross-referenced near the foot of issue 1004.
[2017-04-13 04:47:04] <LWSS> how do you search gitter
[2017-04-13 04:47:15] <LWSS> I come back on and there's like thousands of messages
[2017-04-13 04:47:20] <LWSS> and I cant look at my mentions
[2017-04-13 04:48:24] <LWSS> ah the archive works alright
[2017-04-13 05:44:09] <revisualize> I have issues. I am getting PM insults and belittling comments by an individual via this medium. Who do I report these issues to?

[2017-04-13 06:52:46] <LWSS> I dont get how that harms your screen recording@revisualize
[2017-04-13 06:53:10] <revisualize> LWSS: It doesn't. Just a heads up.
[2017-04-13 06:54:45] <LWSS> ok
[2017-04-13 14:13:43] <uiharu-s> Hello :D Apologies if this isn't the place for feedback or feature requests: it's a little inconvenient to mention people in the iOS app, because people's handles don't show next to their messages (only their names), and @ doesn't filter people by names (only their handles). Thanks
[2017-04-13 16:33:23] <mhham> Hi there is there a way to edit a message on gitter android client ?
[2017-04-13 16:34:47] <mhham> Found the anwer : double tap !
[2017-04-13 18:58:13] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @revisualizeSend me a one to one orsupport@gitter.imwith more details. I can handle it
[2017-04-13 19:27:01] <Zoey76> Hello everyone, I have a GitHub organization and I had 2 chats, one for each repository of the project
[2017-04-13 19:27:46] <Zoey76> those repositories have been moved to BitBucket and I'm unable to configure it to work with the repositories (the feeds)
[2017-04-13 19:27:53] <mydigitalself> MadLittleMods: i already had a chat with@revisualize
[2017-04-13 19:28:05] <mydigitalself> Zoey76: do they still exist on GitHub?
[2017-04-13 19:28:07] <Zoey76> Also I'd like to know if it's possible to remove a chat remove
[2017-04-13 19:28:27] <Zoey76> mydigitalself: No, I have them removed, only organization exists
[2017-04-13 19:28:55] <mydigitalself> right... that's going to be a problem then. if the room was created from a GitHub repo, and the repo no longer exists, the room is not going to work any more
[2017-04-13 19:29:19] <Zoey76> it works, just some features are no longer useful
[2017-04-13 19:29:36] <mydigitalself> yeah, it's not really designed to work without the repo behind it
[2017-04-13 19:29:47] <mydigitalself> that it works is probably somewhat accidental
[2017-04-13 19:30:13] <Zoey76> I didn't mean to cause any issue
[2017-04-13 19:30:22] <Zoey76> we had to move our project there
[2017-04-13 19:30:27] <mydigitalself> the only thing we support with BitBucket is adding a feed of activity to the right panel - and you probably can't add one to a room that's sort of broken by not having the github repo
[2017-04-13 19:30:34] <mydigitalself> so what i'd do is create a completely new room
[2017-04-13 19:30:39] <mydigitalself> with the add a room button
[2017-04-13 19:30:45] <Zoey76> Okay
[2017-04-13 19:30:55] <mydigitalself> and then you can probably add the bitbucket integration to the new room
[2017-04-13 19:33:02] <Zoey76> Created new room
[2017-04-13 19:33:18] <Zoey76> I'll try to add bitbucket's feed
[2017-04-13 19:34:08] <revisualize> mydigitalself: Thanks again. I know that this may not be in your wheelhouse. I hope the issue doesn't escalate. But, after almost 2 years engaging with communities via Gitter, I get 1 "issue". I'd say, I'm doing okay. cc:@MadLittleMods... Thanks for everything you guys do.
[2017-04-13 20:04:37] <MadLittleMods> revisualize: 
[2017-04-13 20:05:30] <poppabear8883> here is my suggestion for the day
[2017-04-13 20:05:50] <poppabear8883> Gitter should have video's and images collapsed by default with a button under the link to expand
[2017-04-13 20:06:22] <revisualize> I second this suggestion.
[2017-04-13 20:06:40] <revisualize> I'm tired of being rick rolled
[2017-04-13 20:07:08] <poppabear8883> or a boss finding something inappropriate on your screen!
[2017-04-13 20:07:46] <revisualize> poppabear8883: Quit looking at inappropriate stuff and inappropriate stuff won't be on your screen! ... (Doesn't solve the problem but, it sure is funny to say.)

[2017-04-14 07:26:04] <grahamperrin> esciencera_twitter: what is yourGitter supportquestion? WhatsApp ≠ Gitter.
[2017-04-14 07:28:22] <esciencera_twitter> Whatsapp discuss for code is better than gitter
[2017-04-14 07:28:39] <esciencera_twitter> Its directly solve problm
[2017-04-14 07:28:43] <grahamperrin> What is your question about Gitter?
[2017-04-14 07:29:28] <esciencera_twitter> Gitter is good but its not perfact reply all dough
[2017-04-14 07:29:55] <grahamperrin> Understood. I have commented and voted in a number of reported issues. Are you here to discuss WhatsApp?
[2017-04-14 07:30:27] <esciencera_twitter> I mean i want where people directly solve his problem like stack overflow
[2017-04-14 07:31:14] <esciencera_twitter> No i am discuss about whatsapp i want a platform where peolpe simple discuss his problm
[2017-04-14 07:32:32] <grahamperrin> esciencera_twitter: you seem relatively new to Gitter. Do you have a problem with Gitter? Being specific will help us to offer directions.

[2017-04-14 18:57:11] <phades69> Don't rely on just 1 virus scanner...
[2017-04-14 18:59:27] <phades69> who are the admins in here anyway?
[2017-04-14 18:59:31] <cbj4074> I don't... Symantec hasn't either
[2017-04-14 18:59:46] <phades69> check the first link i put up
[2017-04-14 19:00:02] <phades69> virus total scans with all of them
[2017-04-14 19:00:02] <cbj4074> I did
[2017-04-14 19:00:26] <phades69> defender and symantec scans were performed and didn't catch it
[2017-04-14 19:00:38] <phades69> actually, they hardly catch any thing... lol
[2017-04-14 19:01:14] <cbj4074> I hear you, I'm just wondering whether it's more likely that 61 miss it and 2 catch it, or the 2 are false-positives.
[2017-04-14 19:02:43] <phades69> I agree completely
[2017-04-14 19:03:03] <phades69> but, if it's a false positive, should be easy to fix so it doesn't come up on scan
[2017-04-14 19:03:13] <cbj4074> The most effective thing to do would probably be to open an issue on GitHub
[2017-04-14 19:03:25] <phades69> I wouldnt use unless I reviewed the code and compiled it myself
[2017-04-14 19:03:53] <phades69> where's the github repo for the official windows app?
[2017-04-14 19:03:56] <phades69> didn't see it
[2017-04-14 19:04:06] <cbj4074> Do you apply that discipline to every piece of code that executes on your machine?
[2017-04-14 19:04:16] <cbj4074> Not saying one shouldn't, of course.
[2017-04-14 19:04:21] <cbj4074> Just seems like a lot of work!

[2017-04-14 19:04:37] <phades69> For everything that comes up in any scan, yes
[2017-04-14 19:04:54] <phades69> I won't use unless I review and compile myself, or it's corrected and comes up full negative

[2017-04-14 19:05:27] <phades69> otherwise, it goes up on a fresh sandbox'd virtual instance and gets monitored for a period of time before I trust it
[2017-04-14 19:05:50] <cbj4074> That seems reasonably measured
[2017-04-14 19:07:42] <phades69> thx for the link

[2017-04-14 21:59:17] <Zoey76> How can I remove a community?
[2017-04-15 00:39:01] <dluc> where can I find “Gitter Private Repo Access”?
[2017-04-15 00:46:29] <MadLittleMods> dluc: You can add private repo access using the "Allow Private Repo Access" action under the user dropdown in the top-right [<-LINK->] 
[2017-04-15 00:49:01] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @Zoey76Please refrain from pinging directly. If you have deleted the GitHub repo that backs a room, you probably won't be able to delete the room.

[2017-04-15 20:37:55] <Zoey76> Hello, is there a support email or ticket system so I can keep track of the issue I have experienced'
[2017-04-15 22:54:41] <MadLittleMods> @Zoey76 support@gitter.im or if you are fine with the issue being public, https://github.com/gitterHQ/gitter/issuesI can take care of it but I need to know:Which room? And where is your new room/community?https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter?at=58f16dfde3700b1461c94065
[2017-04-15 22:57:06] <Zoey76> The community is L2J which is based on L2J organisation on GitHub, but since we moved to BitBucket we would like to keep the community name but unbind it from GitHub as it shows some restrictions, after that I'd create L2J/Community room which it does not exist at the moment

[2017-04-15 23:09:18] <nofilenamed> Is it possible to add into the information popup, how time it is in their timezone?
[2017-04-15 23:10:09] <nofilenamed> If the location is provided?
[2017-04-16 00:56:22] <gustavlrsn> How many rooms is it possible to create in your Gitter community?
[2017-04-16 00:56:39] <InternetUnexplorer> I would assume unlimited, why do you ask?
[2017-04-16 00:57:03] <gustavlrsn> Thinking if it'd be possible to integrate with an idea I have for a project I'm building
[2017-04-16 00:57:25] <gustavlrsn> basically creating one room for each group in my project
[2017-04-16 00:57:36] <gustavlrsn> But probably not very feasible UI wise if it's too many
[2017-04-16 07:26:33] <showpaul> 1
[2017-04-17 06:11:39] <metalbass> hi everyone
[2017-04-17 06:12:39] <metalbass> I had just received an email from gitter about setting up a welcome message. From the email I understood that i'd see it by entering this chat room.
[2017-04-17 06:13:34] <metalbass> where is the welcome message?
[2017-04-17 07:18:54] <grahamperrin> metalbass: can you recall the name of the room, or organisation?
[2017-04-17 07:19:08] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-04-17 10:02:31] <metalbass> grahamperrin: on the email it only says: "Check out the example Welcome Message from our gitterHQ/gitter room.". BTW, I'm looking at this on the phone.
[2017-04-17 10:47:55] <grahamperrin> metalbass: thanks, it does help to know that you're limited to a phone. On a more traditional browser, the welcome message for this room appears as shown in the first screenshot at [<-LINK->] above.
[2017-04-17 14:21:24] <InternetUnexplorer> grahamperrin: most of the people who post here in error don't delete their messages, and while I know you don't want to delete them silently, deleting their message and then posting a warning about where it went would make sense.
[2017-04-17 14:21:57] <InternetUnexplorer> As in, redirect them and then delete their message if they haven't done so themselves.
[2017-04-17 17:15:40] <grahamperrin> InternetUnexplorer: I understand, and sometimes empathise with, the frustration that can be felt when we find posts that do not relate to Gitter support.
[2017-04-17 17:25:04] <grahamperrin> For simple directions/orientation, I prefer to not take a 'warning' tone because there is, if I recall correctly, at least one page that gives the impression that this room will be informal, welcoming and friendly. (When I next see the page, I'll take a screenshot.)
[2017-04-17 19:15:15] <oddRaven> I am trying to download Gitter client for Windows, but the download keeps getting stuck on both Firefox and Chrome
[2017-04-17 19:19:22] <LWSS> ahh Timo thanks for bumping, I realized I posted in the wrong room.
[2017-04-17 19:19:44] <LWSS> gitterteam: Guys, stop autoloading pictures and shit pleasepeople send IP grabbers with picture linksalso the youtube previews are still too BIG
[2017-04-17 19:30:21] <grahamperrin> LWSS: I think there's an issue in GitHub for one of those.
[2017-04-17 19:44:28] <LWSS> some of them don't work, but some guy put one in our gitter and got like 57 hits instantly
[2017-04-17 19:44:42] <LWSS> if you do it right, it autoloads
[2017-04-17 19:52:56] <grahamperrin> Some of what?
[2017-04-17 22:17:46] <j127> How do I uninstall Gitter on Windows 8? I uninstalled it through the control panel, but it failed with an error message that not everything could be removed. Now it's gone from the control panel, but it still auto-launches when I boot the computer. What files and registry items do I need to delete to uninstall it manually?
[2017-04-17 23:58:25] <magaronov> Hi everyone! Question: is there an easy approach for adding bots to a git chatroom? Or do you always have to set up a standalone bot app? I'm looking to set up some simple recurring reminders at this moment.
[2017-04-18 12:46:16] <cbj4074> j127: Haven't had that happen, personally, but I'm pretty sure that Gitter is self-contained with the exception of the start-on-login feature. Just remove it from the Startup items in Windows 8, and then trash the Gitter app itself atC:\Users\you\AppData\Local\Gitter.
[2017-04-18 12:47:36] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @j127See [<-LINK->] 
[2017-04-18 12:48:56] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @magaronovYou need to setup a standalone bot app that uses the [<-LINK->] through the bot user (just like any other user)
[2017-04-18 13:51:59] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @Zoey76I have removed the GitHub association from the community and added you as an admin
[2017-04-18 13:53:31] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @nofilenamedYou can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-04-18 13:54:30] <nofilenamed> MadLittleMods: thank you
[2017-04-18 15:07:41] <benomatis> I have 2 issues with the Gitter app for mac: 1. whenever I open it, it loads, like if it would open the first time, there seems to be nothing static in it, stuff that would be there always, it looks like it needs constant connection and reloads every time. 2. when I close the System Preferences app, it makes the Gitter app to pop-up (and load, as stated above).
[2017-04-18 15:08:24] <benomatis> Now I can imagine point 1 to be normal, point 2 seems to be strange though.
[2017-04-18 15:35:08] <Cyric263> say someone is on my privaete conversation... how do i get rid of them LOL
[2017-04-18 15:35:29] <Cyric263> it just says hide
[2017-04-18 15:35:39] <Cyric263> so there always going to be there?
[2017-04-18 15:54:07] <cbj4074> That's been my experience, yes.
[2017-04-18 15:56:46] <cbj4074> But if you think about it, there really is no difference between "remove" and "hide".
[2017-04-18 15:56:57] <cbj4074> (given that the conversation between you two is never deleted)
[2017-04-18 15:57:32] <cbj4074> Well, I'm not sure about "never", but you can't initiate any such deletion yourself (to my knowledge)
[2017-04-18 16:50:06] <magaronov> MadLittleMods: -- thanks for the note on the bot. I figured as much after I read up a bit. I actually did manage to get the simple reminder system running using regular old HTTP posts via Azure Logic Apps. Was fun! Kinda want to do a blog post on it, hah.
[2017-04-18 16:53:56] <MadLittleMods>  April 18, 2017 10:07 AM @benomatis What version of the desktop app do you have (I assume 1.x which is Safari-based)? Create an issue so we can track this https://github.com/gitterHQ/desktop. Perhaps gitterHQ/gitter#640You can try the 3.x version of the app which is NW.js based, https://update.gitter.im/osx/Gitter-3.1.0.dmg
[2017-04-18 16:54:05] <Techievena> Hello guys does gitter integration supports customized github integration based on labels?
[2017-04-18 16:55:00] <MadLittleMods> Techievena: Not sure exactly what you mean. There isn't a way to make only certain labeled issues/PRs appear in the activity feed
[2017-04-18 16:55:50] <grahamperrin> … app for mac: 1. whenever I open it, it loads, like if it would open the first time, …@MadLittleMods for what it's worth, I was glancing at the keychain aspect of https://github.com/gitterHQ/desktop/issues/183#issuecomment-284573322
[2017-04-18 16:56:29] <grahamperrin> benomatis: does the application not, or no longer, work with keychains?
[2017-04-18 16:58:17] <Techievena> I meant I just wanted see the activities of a subgroup of an organization and we have only one repository. So to differentiate the subgroups from each other we always mention labels in PR/issues. So is it possible to have that kind of customized integration for github in gitter chat room
[2017-04-18 16:58:27] <Techievena> MadLittleMods: 
[2017-04-18 16:59:26] <Techievena> I just wish to see the activity feed for the subgroup in the chatroom
[2017-04-18 17:00:22] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @grahamperrinProbably not. I think we store stuff in the data path now, [<-LINK->] 
[2017-04-18 17:02:22] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @TechievenaThere isn't a way with the GitHub integration. You could make some middleware application that takes in the GitHub feed and setup your own custom webhook feed
[2017-04-18 17:02:53] <grahamperrin> OK. (I should not expect anywhere under~/Library/Application Support/to be used for storage of credentials.)
[2017-04-18 17:03:57] <MadLittleMods> grahamperrin: It stores a token, not user/pass
[2017-04-18 17:04:07] <grahamperrin> ah OK
[2017-04-18 17:04:27] <Techievena> Thanks for the suggestion and info@MadLittleMods
[2017-04-18 17:08:10] <grahamperrin> If in a terminal window:~/Library/Application\ Support/…
[2017-04-18 17:08:39] <MadLittleMods> grahamperrin: ye, my bad, I was looking at/Library/...(also a thing) instead of~/Library/...
[2017-04-18 17:09:35] <grahamperrin> You'llprobablyalso find/Library/Application Support/in Finder. If not, I'm surprised.
[2017-04-18 17:11:06] <Techievena> MadLittleMods: I wanted to contribute can you please guide me?
[2017-04-18 17:11:57] <MadLittleMods> Techievena: There is [<-LINK->] but the GitHub integration is internal
[2017-04-18 17:13:09] <Techievena> Nope I wanted to  contribute in general.
[2017-04-18 17:13:33] <Techievena> in gitter repositories
[2017-04-18 19:10:01] <benomatis> MadLittleMods: Thanks, I gave 3.1.0 a try, and point 2 has gone, however it still refreshes every time I open it; so are you saying it is not normal that it reloads every time I activate the window? By the way, why is the 1.x version the default one, and no mention of a version 3.x ( [<-LINK->] 
[2017-04-18 19:12:09] <MadLittleMods> benomatis: We still distribute 1.x for macOS because we want to improve the auto-update process there before rolling it out. Whenever opening the app, loading is normal. The desktop app is the web app inside a desktop container
[2017-04-18 19:12:37] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @TechievenaThe main Gitter app isn't open source yet
[2017-04-18 19:13:12] <Techievena> Oops Sorry didn't know that.
[2017-04-18 19:15:51] <benomatis> MadLittleMods: will this ever change, ie. that the app will be a native ("real") app? In the meantime, one more thing came up: desktop notification won't bring the app to front, won't highlight the chat message for which the notification is being shown - is this expected?
[2017-04-18 19:21:12] <MadLittleMods> @benomatis It's unlikely to change from a hybrid app.It looks like it only jumps to the room properly if the app is already up. Create an issue so we can track it, https://github.com/gitterHQ/desktop/issues
[2017-04-18 19:21:40] <MadLittleMods> benomatis: You can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-04-18 20:15:34] <benomatis> @benomatis It's unlikely to change from a hybrid app.@MadLittleMods why is that so?
[2017-04-18 20:17:22] <Zoey76> benomatis: I guess that it's because the same code base for the WebApp can be used for the hybrid app
[2017-04-18 20:17:34] <Zoey76> either Angular or something else
[2017-04-18 20:18:02] <Zoey76> and if you want native app you need to learn several programming languages
[2017-04-18 20:19:03] <benomatis> Zoey76: well, I guess one would need to make a survey and see how much a native app would be wanted among the userbase... probably a topic for further out in the future
[2017-04-18 20:20:00] <Zoey76> what would be the difference for the end user? better performance?
[2017-04-18 20:24:39] <benomatis> Zoey76: yep, pretty much
[2017-04-18 21:44:34] <ShawnTalbert> I don't buy the assumption that a native app is automatically faster.
[2017-04-18 23:09:20] <franpola> Hi
[2017-04-18 23:10:08] <InternetUnexplorer> franpola: Hi, what's your Gitter support question?
[2017-04-18 23:12:03] <franpola> nothing, im just new here, and i dont think i know what i am doing
[2017-04-18 23:12:32] <bashfulrobot> Hi there - I am trying to add a bot to a private room. I was recently added as an admin. But any member I try adding is "forbidden".
[2017-04-18 23:12:51] <InternetUnexplorer> franpola: Are you on mobile?
[2017-04-18 23:13:22] <franpola> yes, it doesnt work very well
[2017-04-18 23:14:22] <InternetUnexplorer> :) There's a message about what this room is about, but it doesn't show up on mobile.
[2017-04-18 23:15:22] <InternetUnexplorer> Anyways, if you're confused, this is a support room.
[2017-04-18 23:19:53] <franpola> allright thank you
[2017-04-19 00:59:05] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-04-19 01:03:00] <grahamperrin> – I wonder whether use of that emblem is widespread, and whether its generic nature ever causes people to chat on Gitter/GITTER/gittergenerally(without special attention to what room they're in).
[2017-04-19 01:05:23] <grahamperrin> Toying with the wordspecial… the headquarters of any organisation is a special place.
[2017-04-19 01:09:42] <grahamperrin> suprememoocow: or@mydigitalselfplease, has the tagline for Gitter changed:from Where developers come to talk (seen … I can't recall where) 
to Where communities thrive (seen by some clients before sign in)?
[2017-04-19 03:11:46] <MadLittleMods> @grahamperrin Both changed in July 2016Home:"The home of communities" -> "Where communities thrive"NLI chat:"Where developers come to talk" -> "Where communities thrive"

[2017-04-19 08:27:28] <osirisseye> hello awesome people
[2017-04-19 08:28:38] <osirisseye> i have an issue with gitter - went on a spree yesterday and done a lot of challenges (now ~100 under my belt) but I can't receive any brownie points because gitter doesn't seem to see my account - signed in again and my account is empty.
[2017-04-19 08:28:57] <osirisseye>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-04-19 08:29:15] <osirisseye>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-04-19 08:29:35] <osirisseye> what should I do not to lose my profile?
[2017-04-19 09:51:56] <grahamperrin> osirisseye: have you sought advice from Free Code Camp?
[2017-04-19 09:52:23] <osirisseye> no, not yet (this can take some time I guess so my frist steps were here)
[2017-04-19 09:52:50] <osirisseye> the only thing I can think of is that I an see 'beta' before the adress on the dark themed version (the one I was using)
[2017-04-19 09:53:05] <osirisseye> standard version (the one I was switched to) is not beta
[2017-04-19 10:08:35] <grahamperrin> Whilst Free Code Camp does use the Gitter service for some things, I doubt thatGitter supportcan help with your Free Code Camp beta issue. You are – now – using Gitter apparently without difficulty. Please approach Free Code Camp for support. Thanks.
[2017-04-19 10:08:57] <osirisseye> oh god
[2017-04-19 10:08:59] <osirisseye> of course
[2017-04-19 10:09:10] <osirisseye> I'm sorry mistakenly I confused both things
[2017-04-19 10:09:17] <osirisseye> obviously this is ot for you guys
[2017-04-19 10:09:21] <osirisseye> btw great product :)
[2017-04-19 12:02:12] <ashansupant> Hi All, I'm new to Gitter. May I know how do I report a particular user on Gitter?
[2017-04-19 13:21:39] <douglascorrea> Hi guys, is there a way to install gitter desktop on Fedora?
[2017-04-19 13:21:50] <douglascorrea> I tried allien on deb package but it not worked
[2017-04-19 14:01:10] <InternetUnexplorer> ashansupant: There's no automated way to report users currently, but you can contact the Gitter admins and they will take care of it.
[2017-04-19 14:04:55] <cbj4074> douglascorrea: My understanding is that the Desktop app is available only on Debian and its derivatives at the moment. :/
[2017-04-19 14:04:59] <DominiqueMakowski> Hi, I created a [<-LINK->] for my package. It says that It is webhooked to it on Gitter, but the activity does not appear. Moreover, on the github page, the webhook does not appear... how can I reconnect the room with the package?
[2017-04-19 14:20:27] <douglascorrea> cbj4074: thanks ;(
[2017-04-19 14:23:42] <cbj4074> douglascorrea: No problem. I suspect that will change once the software is open-sourced under the GitLab acquisition and end-users are able to create their own packages.
[2017-04-19 14:31:00] <Zoey76> did GitLab acquried Gitter? I though it was some other company
[2017-04-19 14:39:39] <InternetUnexplorer> It was GitLab, yes.
[2017-04-19 14:40:10] <InternetUnexplorer> You can get more info here: [<-LINK->] 
[2017-04-19 14:40:16] <InternetUnexplorer> Zoey76: 
[2017-04-19 15:02:49] <Zoey76> I think BitBucket login would be great
[2017-04-19 15:06:55] <grahamperrin> Zoey76: you can make an issue of the feature request, if it's not already an issue.
[2017-04-19 15:08:30] <Zoey76> I was just typing outloud ^__^
[2017-04-20 08:12:23] <oxitech239> Gitter is great, i don't get why some move to Slack instead
[2017-04-20 12:20:18] <grahamperrin> I'm not familiar with Slack, I had only one opportunity to use it, a few months ago, and that was less than a week. Iimaginethat Slack is in some ways more mature than Gitter.
[2017-04-20 13:23:23] <dumconstantin> Heya, I guess this was asked a thousand times (and mentioned here also [<-LINK->] ) but I still don't get it. How do I link a room to a repo so that " [<-ISSUE->] " will correspond to the issues of that repo?
[2017-04-20 13:28:19] <dumconstantin> nvm, so I just need to follow the org/repo url when creating the community and room.
[2017-04-20 14:19:17] <calmeida-fuze> I'm trying to use the OpenWindow API, I found following bullhorn documentation: [<-LINK->] This seems great, but I'm not able to get it working, for example to view a candidate data
[2017-04-20 14:19:39] <calmeida-fuze> I'm trying following URL: [<-LINK->] , but it asks me to login but the nothing opens related to Add a candidate
[2017-04-20 15:12:17] <grahamperrin> calmeida-fuze: are you with Free Code Camp?
[2017-04-20 15:48:43] <grahamperrin> Please see [<-LINK->] 
[2017-04-20 18:11:24] <Oldes> Hello... is there something I could do to get Gitter use code colorize for specific language which is not supported now? I know that the automatic detection is consuming resources, but at least it could use the correct language if specified manually.
[2017-04-20 18:26:12] <Oldes> What syntax highlighter is Gitter using now? Linquist, Pygments or something else?
[2017-04-20 18:30:05] <Oldes> I'm interested in [<-LINK->] . Github supports [<-LINK->] and [<-LINK->] 
[2017-04-20 18:42:28] <InternetUnexplorer> Oldes: see [<-LINK->] 
[2017-04-20 18:42:44] <InternetUnexplorer> (I may have misunderstood your question)
[2017-04-20 18:46:59] <Oldes> I'm interested in the code syntax highlighting... Red community is quite active here on Gitter and any time someone post some code, the colors are not good as the detection does not recognize Red language... even when specified directly.
[2017-04-20 18:50:14] <Oldes> From your link.. I can see, that one of necessary steps is addRedinto [<-LINK->] 
[2017-04-20 18:56:13] <Oldes> And [<-LINK->] seems to be used now. Which does not knowRedyet.
[2017-04-20 19:11:24] <Oldes> Problem is, that I'm trying to getRed languageinto this framework since 2015:/ [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-04-20 21:41:35] <Zoey76> is there anything like redirects for rooms?
[2017-04-21 14:09:50] <arch-master> Zoey76: You could write a bot that posts a link...
[2017-04-21 18:09:40] <benknoble> Hello. I’m pretty new to using Gitter, but I’ve noticed that with the dark theme in the Desktop version, theRepo Infosection has text so dark it’s unreadable. [<-CODE->] 
[2017-04-21 18:13:40] <MadLittleMods> benknoble: You can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-04-21 18:14:19] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @Zoey76There is but they have to be manually setup by us. We do this for GitHub renames/transfers for example
[2017-04-21 18:15:22] <benknoble> MadLittleMods: thanks
[2017-04-22 17:20:50] <Reeson55> yo, gitter for me start to run very slow after it been opened for a while because of the chat history and i have to manual reset it. it would be nice if there was an option to limit chat history for it to run smoother.
[2017-04-22 18:46:55] <grahamperrin> Reeson55: in a web browser?
[2017-04-23 14:05:29] <ktpx> Dark theme in the Android app would be nice.
[2017-04-23 15:17:58] <grahamperrin> ktpx: please subscribe to [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-04-23 15:20:27] <mukhlismdt> grahamperrin: hi could you please help me to restore my lost comunity? [<-LINK->] 
[2017-04-23 15:23:53] <mukhlismdt> *Community
[2017-04-23 15:24:06] <grahamperrin> I can not help with that, sorry.I imagine that more information will be required, so I suggest [<-LINK->] where information can be gathered in one place.
[2017-04-23 15:24:46] <grahamperrin> (Any issue that is added there will appear in the sidebar here.)
[2017-04-25 08:31:47] <listochkin> Is there a way to lock the room and only allow specific people to post?
[2017-04-25 08:32:10] <listochkin> If not is there a way to lock the room completely?
[2017-04-25 08:43:11] <mydigitalself> there isn't, no. only you can set permission on who can join@listochkin
[2017-04-25 08:45:38] <listochkin> ok, thanks!
[2017-04-25 18:51:29] <mukhlismdt> grahamperrin: thankyou.
[2017-04-26 09:32:52] <gozonjoedaimar> good day guys. I just want to ask where to find recent mentions or is it available on this chat service? thanks. just mention me
[2017-04-26 14:45:00] <DanielGGordon> Feature Request:I'm not particular on the implementation, but I would like to see the ability to see/mark the beginning of conversations, and possibly entire conversations.For example, there could be 2-3x conversations going on at once in a Gitter chat. I am interested in one of them - but I don't even know where the conversation started.So I have to manually scroll up, reading every comment, until I think I've determined where the discussion began.
[2017-04-26 17:33:24] <rahmanoh> Hello All, Im Rahul  from India, new to coding . so im just following the steps provided by FreeCodeCamp.
[2017-04-26 17:34:54] <MadLittleMods> rahmanoh: This room is for Gitter support. You probably want to be here [<-LINK->] 
[2017-04-26 17:38:15] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @DanielGGordonThreaded conversations. You can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-04-26 17:41:40] <rahmanoh> MadLittleMods: Thank you Eric.
[2017-04-27 02:11:52] <joewelds> can anyone tell me how to get out of a never ending loop with windows Gitter?
[2017-04-27 02:12:39] <joewelds> i click "Allow" and the integration is enabled in Gitter on the config page of the site, but it just minimizes the Gitter app when I click Allow
[2017-04-27 09:14:50] <zrbecker> How do I change the default notification settings for rooms? Right now any time I join a room I have to remember to switch it.
[2017-04-27 09:16:50] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @joeweldsAre you behind a proxy/vpn? [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-04-27 09:17:19] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @zrbeckerPress the "Configured Defaults" button in the bottom-right of the notification modal
[2017-04-27 09:18:02] <zrbecker> MadLittleMods: Thanks! I can't believe I missed that.
[2017-04-27 16:13:29] <joewelds> MadLittleMods: nope. not behind a firewall or on a vpn.
[2017-04-27 19:52:51] <einar-io> When I paste a screenshot from my clipboard I always get this notification: "Error Uploading File. Could not find a bored instance. No responsive uploaders". It used to work fine until maybe a month ago. Any ideas?
[2017-04-28 04:25:07] <cute-angelia> hello
[2017-04-28 05:15:02] <InternetUnexplorer> cute-angelia: Hello, what is your Gitter support question?
[2017-04-28 07:08:18] <iancrowther> hey folks, whats the best way to run gitter on centos? is it in the browser or is there a fairly straight forward port?
[2017-04-28 07:09:26] <iancrowther> ooo just found gitter-cli..
[2017-04-28 08:40:09] <lars20070> We would like to create a chat roomhttp://gitter.im/xyz/xyzfor our private organisation/repositoryhttp://github.com/xyz/xyzbut get the error messageThis address is not available.I am owner of the organisation and repository. Any advice?
[2017-04-28 08:51:44] <mydigitalself> lars20070: have you added private repo access? [<-LINK->] 
[2017-04-28 09:01:19] <lars20070>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-04-28 09:02:29] <lars20070> Yes. Both Public and Private Repo Access.
[2017-04-28 16:06:59] <lars20070> Resolved. - I am in multiple orginisations and access was granted only for some of them. Not that clear from the user interface, see above. Thanks for the support.
[2017-04-28 21:35:24] <diomed> did gitter ever become open source?
[2017-04-28 21:35:37] <diomed> like, can one contribute, or report smth
[2017-04-28 21:42:41] <InternetUnexplorer> diomed: Issue tracker is public, Gitter  be open sourced this summer.
[2017-04-28 21:43:05] <diomed> oh, I see . thanks for letting me know
[2017-04-28 21:43:25] <diomed> InternetUnexplorer: pls give me link to it
[2017-04-28 21:44:08] <InternetUnexplorer>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-04-28 21:45:06] <diomed> thank you
[2017-04-28 21:45:16] <diomed> so it will be on github
[2017-04-28 21:46:21] <InternetUnexplorer> Not sure, since Gitter was acquired by GitLab the source might be hosted there and mirrored on GitHub.
[2017-04-29 13:49:17] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-04-29 14:32:28] <gdmec07140602> 我想问下，登录Gitter，弹出Gitter APPs界面，是空白的，这是什么原因呢？
[2017-04-29 14:38:24] <gdmec07140602> I would like to ask, log Gitter, pop-up Gitter APPs interface, is blank, what is the reason?
[2017-04-29 14:54:02] <gdmec07140602> Jyothsnasrinivas: Know what is the reason
[2017-04-29 16:59:40] <SellersC> Hey folks is there a DB SQL type channel here?
[2017-04-29 18:10:12] <awb715> Are there any plans to do facebook or email signup integrations? Right now there is only github and twitter
[2017-04-29 19:19:52] <grahamperrin> SellersC: hey, scroll up a handful of messages, please follow the link toOrientation for newcomers.
[2017-04-29 19:20:28] <grahamperrin> awb715: no such plan, as far as I'm aware. Orientation for newcomers includes a link to a blog post about GitLab.
[2017-04-30 06:31:42] <MarcWeber> Is it possible to search messages written by me? This question is not in the topic list.
[2017-04-30 07:28:05] <grahamperrin> MarcWeber: from:MarcWeber
[2017-04-30 07:30:42] <grahamperrin>  [<-ISSUE->]  [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-04-30 10:30:35] <evol8hektve_twitter> how do I set up irc.gitter.im is there a specific process
[2017-04-30 10:57:58] <grahamperrin> evol8hektve_twitter: I guess, [<-LINK->] 
[2017-04-30 18:54:13] <awb715> grahamperrin: how do you know?
[2017-04-30 18:54:45] <awb715> I wanna make a community but the users most likely wouldn't have github accounts
[2017-04-30 18:54:59] <InternetUnexplorer> @grahamperrin how do you know?@awb715 He follows updates and issues.
[2017-04-30 18:55:23] <awb715> okay
[2017-04-30 18:55:48] <awb715> hmm, I wanna make a online commuity like this [<-LINK->] but I dont want to use slack
[2017-04-30 18:56:39] <InternetUnexplorer> If not Github, then Twitter?
[2017-04-30 18:57:22] <awb715> well gitter has twitter authentication but its just not as commonly used as email or facebook, so acquiring members wouldnt be as efficient
[2017-04-30 18:59:47] <InternetUnexplorer> I'm not sure what to tell you, perhaps when Gitter goes open source later this year you can fork it and change how users authenticate.
[2017-04-30 18:59:57] <awb715> hmm yeah
[2017-04-30 19:00:01] <awb715> I'm considering hipchat too
[2017-04-30 19:00:06] <awb715> Slackisnt good for free online communities
[2017-05-01 03:41:05] <awb715> if anyone has any info on this that would be so helpful!
[2017-05-02 19:21:31] <btcmacroecon> aloha anybody from SF HQ?
[2017-05-02 19:26:37] <btcmacroecon> anybody from Github?
[2017-05-02 19:42:55] <mydigitalself> btcmacroecon: Gitter just integrates with GH, we're not part of GH
[2017-05-02 19:44:26] <viluon> 
[2017-05-02 19:49:10] <viluon> Just Gitter mixing messages from multiple channels again
[2017-05-02 19:51:42] <btcmacroecon> does Gitter have a channel where it would be possible to establish contact with them?
[2017-05-02 19:52:33] <cbj4074> viluon: Oh, gotcha... couldn't really determine anything from the screenshot alone (it's very small on this display) :D Thanks!
[2017-05-02 19:53:28] <cbj4074> And yeah, that is an odd behavior. I've seen the UI display the wrong channel, but I can't say I've seen it mix messages from two or more channels 
[2017-05-02 19:53:45] <cbj4074> btcmacroecon: You're in the right place. What's your question?
[2017-05-02 19:56:51] <btcmacroecon> old fashioned networking, new business development, applying myself and providing cutting edge solutions. Can you get me in touch with your leader?@cbj4074perhaps that's you!?
[2017-05-02 19:58:09] <cbj4074> I'm just a regular Joe-user, no authority here. :D
[2017-05-02 19:58:21] <btcmacroecon> we can take down the bull
[2017-05-02 19:58:41] <btcmacroecon> ill pull it's tale
[2017-05-02 19:59:53] <cbj4074> No bull. As I said, you're in the right place. This is the official support channel. But the admins come and go. Mike is core Gitter, maybe he'll see it fit to reach-out.
[2017-05-02 20:00:06] <cbj4074> (the gentleman who responded to you, above)
[2017-05-02 20:14:14] <btcmacroecon> Hi Mike! Thanks Ben
[2017-05-02 20:19:38] <cbj4074>  Any time
[2017-05-02 21:15:00] <JasonMFry> Is there a way to turn off the badge icon unless I'm at-mentioned?
[2017-05-02 21:15:19] <JasonMFry> I'd like the Gitter app icon to behave like Slack
[2017-05-02 22:18:45] <edmundnoble> I keep encountering issues with users who drown out every conversation that anyone else is trying to have, and the channels become a single person talking to themselves continuously. Is there a fix in the works?
[2017-05-02 23:05:06] <cbj4074> edmundnoble: Supposedly.
[2017-05-02 23:10:12] <cbj4074> It's called "the most basic ignore capability possible", and it's under consideration.
[2017-05-02 23:18:16] <edmundnoble> I don't know if that will be helpful.
[2017-05-02 23:18:31] <edmundnoble> It's not that I personally am annoyed. It's that only one conversation can take place at a time.
[2017-05-02 23:18:43] <edmundnoble> I don't want to silence these users, I just don't want it to drown out everyone else.
[2017-05-02 23:19:12] <InternetUnexplorer> Ask them to take it to a DM?
[2017-05-02 23:20:05] <InternetUnexplorer> It's not great, but I can't think of another way to isolate a specific conversation between 2 people.
[2017-05-02 23:20:16] <InternetUnexplorer> Perhaps a slack-style thread feature?
[2017-05-02 23:20:18] <edmundnoble> It's not between two people, unfortunately. And it's often relevant to the room.
[2017-05-02 23:20:35] <edmundnoble> Slack has threads? What?
[2017-05-02 23:20:42] <edmundnoble> Is that a recent thing?
[2017-05-02 23:20:49] <InternetUnexplorer> Not really.
[2017-05-02 23:20:59] <InternetUnexplorer> You can start a thread from a message in slack by clicking on it.
[2017-05-02 23:21:27] <cbj4074> Ah, yes, "threads". I see what you're saying, now.
[2017-05-02 23:21:38] <cbj4074> Agreed. It would be a nice addition.
[2017-05-02 23:22:19] <edmundnoble> That sounds potentially very useful. I suppose any threading has to be at least somewhat after-the-fact, just to avoid interrupting the flow of a conversation.
[2017-05-02 23:24:00] <InternetUnexplorer> Unfortunately, the Gitter team seems to have abandoned making even the simplest changes (see [<-ISSUE->] ) while they prepare to open source the project. If they can't fix a 3 line css bug, I doubt they can add major new features...
[2017-05-02 23:24:46] <InternetUnexplorer> Sorry, I mean [<-ISSUE->] . My bad.
[2017-05-02 23:27:09] <cbj4074> Have there been any commits to anything? Just curious whether we're at a complete standstill here until the transition happens, or what...
[2017-05-02 23:27:21] <cbj4074> (too lazy to check myself...)
[2017-05-02 23:27:27] <InternetUnexplorer> Basically, Gitter's run by a small team and they seem to have their hands full at the moment, so while it's a very good idea it may be a while until it's implemented.
[2017-05-02 23:27:36] <cbj4074> Everybody gets a big check and the boots go up on the desk? :P
[2017-05-02 23:28:00] <cbj4074> (that's a joke, and I'm sure it's not nearly as glamorous as it all seems)
[2017-05-02 23:28:32] <InternetUnexplorer> cbj4074: :P
[2017-05-02 23:29:07] <InternetUnexplorer> While I understand that they have a lot of work to do, some attention to the little details would be appreciated.
[2017-05-02 23:30:39] <InternetUnexplorer> I've been using [<-ISSUE->] as my example; this hasn't been fixed in close to half a year, and it was marked "ready" 5 months ago.
[2017-05-02 23:32:51] <edmundnoble> Well yeah, though even currently-maintained projects can have some incredible bugfix times.
[2017-05-02 23:33:17] <edmundnoble> Most of IntelliJ's bugs in the Scala plugin's typechecker have existed for around five years.
[2017-05-02 23:33:32] <InternetUnexplorer> While I understand it's not a critical security bug, it worries me.
[2017-05-02 23:33:53] <cbj4074> Yeah, and to be fair, it's likely that GitLab made development-heavy demands that must be satisfied in order to complete the acquisition.
[2017-05-02 23:34:15] <cbj4074> It's probably all-hands-on-deck at Gitter HQ.
[2017-05-02 23:34:32] <cbj4074> (the checks probably won't get cut until all of that happens, lol)
[2017-05-02 23:34:38] <edmundnoble> Hopefully those demands align at least somewhat with what the users have been asking for.
[2017-05-02 23:34:38] <InternetUnexplorer> Most likely. I wish them luck as they move forwards.
[2017-05-02 23:35:34] <cbj4074> Agreed, on both counts!
[2017-05-03 01:32:35] <nikitavoloboev> hey
[2017-05-03 01:32:44] <nikitavoloboev> what does this mean
[2017-05-03 01:32:47] <nikitavoloboev>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-05-03 01:32:52] <nikitavoloboev> and how can I give permission for that
[2017-05-03 01:32:59] <nikitavoloboev> I can't find anything about it anywhere
[2017-05-03 01:33:20] <nikitavoloboev> my repo is not tied to any organisation
[2017-05-03 01:33:27] <nikitavoloboev> it's just tied to my name or is that wrong?
[2017-05-03 05:40:11] <matrixbot> aaron.bellaaron.bell: hi
[2017-05-03 05:40:16] <awb715> matrixbot: hi
[2017-05-03 07:14:40] <grahamperrin> Please: not the Gitter support room for tests of Matrix./sandboxor/rhubarbmight be better. Thanks 
[2017-05-03 09:36:24] <falconxunit> 
[2017-05-03 14:18:49] <nikitavoloboev> so can someone help me
[2017-05-03 14:18:52] <nikitavoloboev> set up a gitter channel
[2017-05-03 14:18:55] <nikitavoloboev> I can’t seem to do it :)
[2017-05-03 14:18:58] <nikitavoloboev> :(*
[2017-05-03 14:52:53] <bryevdv> Is it possible to show users' username and display name in the app? Unless they happen to be similar so auto complete suggestions are relevant, it's basically impossible to @ mention someone in the app
[2017-05-03 14:54:12] <bryevdv> Or at least be able to click on their avatar to find out the right username to @ mention?
[2017-05-03 15:12:37] <andrewpthorp_twitter> How do I set my username?
[2017-05-03 15:12:46] <andrewpthorp_twitter> The@andrewpthorp_twitteris offputting :D
[2017-05-03 15:41:10] <cbj4074> andrewpthorp_twitter: Log in with GitHub instead.
[2017-05-03 15:56:01] <bfritchie_twitter> Is it not possible to edit account settings, like username and the pic?
[2017-05-03 16:17:16] <cbj4074> bfritchie_twitter: Username and avatar are based upon which method you use to login.
[2017-05-03 16:17:29] <cbj4074> Your avatar may be cached.
[2017-05-03 16:17:50] <cbj4074> If it's the_twitteryou don't like, scroll up about two lines for the solution.
[2017-05-03 16:18:09] <bfritchie_twitter> Yeah, I knew how they were created. Just asking if I am missing how to edit them, or if it is not even possible.
[2017-05-03 16:18:30] <cbj4074> Just change it at the source (Twitter, or whatever). The cache will cycle eventually.
[2017-05-03 16:30:28] <mydigitalself> bfritchie_twitter: it's not currently possible, it will be in the future
[2017-05-03 16:40:53] <mydigitalself> @cbj4074 we're busy trying to finish up the merge request to report content & block users+delete messages based on abuse reports. in parallel, we're mostly trying to get everything done for open sourcing, which means removing all configuration secret parameters, moving out all of our private NPM modules and making sure they are all open sourceable, reconfiguring how we build and deploy Gitter as part of all of these changes. this is taking up most of our resource at the moment, but are making good progress.after the above two, will work on the block functionality and will also start accepting community contributions for new features.
[2017-05-03 16:41:26] <mydigitalself> oh, and GitLab integration
[2017-05-03 16:42:27] <mydigitalself> and train up some GitLab folks so we have more than 2 developers (the 4 of us are design/product+2 developers+1 devops/sysadmin). so not a huge amount of resource yet.
[2017-05-03 16:52:51] <cbj4074> mydigitalself: Awesome, thanks so much for the extremely helpful update! 
[2017-05-03 16:52:58] <cbj4074> (I'm sure many others will appreciate it, too)
[2017-05-03 17:08:52] <bfritchie_twitter> mydigitalself: Ok, thanks
[2017-05-03 18:52:37] <grahamperrin> mydigitalself: huge respect for the work that's done by the handful of people.
[2017-05-03 20:16:37] <jarrod817> New gutter user here, while using the android app I was trying to follow some projects but inadvertently click on some "people" accounts instead.
[2017-05-03 20:19:57] <jarrod817> .....sorry, how do I remove them from my "all conversations" window?
[2017-05-03 20:24:30] <dragon788> jarrod817: you may be able to long press and then "hide"
[2017-05-03 20:27:09] <jarrod817> Unfortunately, nothing happens after long pressing.
[2017-05-03 20:32:42] <jarrod817> dragon788: Thanks for the suggestion
[2017-05-03 20:33:12] <dragon788> np, I know on the desktop/browser client there is a 3 dot menu to the right of the user/room name you can click
[2017-05-03 20:33:31] <dragon788> on Android sometimes you have to hit the menu button but not all Android devices support that or have one
[2017-05-03 20:52:26] <jarrod817> dragon788: I was able to do it from my desktop! Thanks  you!

[2017-05-04 02:06:01] <jarrod817> InternetUnexplorer: where is the orientation at?
[2017-05-04 02:07:25] <jarrod817> Obviously I'm also a newbie.
[2017-05-04 02:10:33] <InternetUnexplorer> jarrod817: The orientation is [<-LINK->] .
[2017-05-04 02:18:07] <cbj4074> Can that not be made "more official"?
[2017-05-04 02:18:35] <InternetUnexplorer> ...yeah, it's not great. Props to@grahamperrinfor doingsomething, though.
[2017-05-04 02:18:38] <cbj4074> Somebody get the guy agitterHQ/*repo! A Gist, at least!
[2017-05-04 02:18:58] <cbj4074> Certainly no fault of his own, somebody really ought to give the gentleman the appropriate resources
[2017-05-04 02:21:08] <cbj4074> I paid good money for this! 
[2017-05-04 02:21:44] <InternetUnexplorer> InternetUnexplorer: just wants [<-ISSUE->] to be fixed, is that too much to ask?
[2017-05-04 02:22:27] <cbj4074> The first person to refuse a PR after the "transition" will be shamed publicly
[2017-05-04 02:23:00] <InternetUnexplorer> Mark my words, the first PR is gonna be mine and it's gonna fix [<-ISSUE->] .
[2017-05-04 02:23:15] <InternetUnexplorer> I'll make it right now.
[2017-05-04 02:33:31] <cbj4074> 
[2017-05-04 02:59:44] <grahamperrin> Qui, moi? Un Gitter repo pour moi? I hope not … don't like working with GitHub:-)
[2017-05-04 07:37:44] <pawankumar2901_twitter> Hello peeps !
[2017-05-04 08:26:58] <mydigitalself> grahamperrin: you should have permission to change the welcome message

[2017-05-04 14:05:20] <Zoey76> from now removed*
[2017-05-04 14:06:03] <Zoey76> manselis: I do not understand what you mean.
[2017-05-04 15:12:08] <gburgett> Hey yall, I want to add a hubot to my room but I can't register an application.  On this page]( [<-LINK->] 
[2017-05-04 15:12:23] <gburgett> I click the
[2017-05-04 15:12:55] <gburgett> Register the application link and it does a redirect to the homepage
[2017-05-04 15:13:37] <gburgett> (Sorry for the broken messages, seems like it automatically sends on mobile firefox if I navigate away)
[2017-05-04 16:24:59] <mydigitalself> gburgett: you need to sign to developer.gitter.im - top right corner
[2017-05-04 16:28:18] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] thanks@mydigitalselfI could – if you (and others) like – make an extreme edition: a single sentence, plain English, with a link to [<-LINK->] 
[2017-05-04 16:30:02] <mydigitalself> if it's got a link, probably less chance of people reading it
[2017-05-04 16:30:06] <mydigitalself> well, clicking on it
[2017-05-04 16:30:35] <grahamperrin> (Whilst drafting the whole 'Orientation for newcomers' Iknewthat the written language is stilted, much more formal than I am as a person, but it sort of serves a purpose. I struggled with how to get a condensed views of the various things thatmightbe read.)
[2017-05-04 16:30:56] <grahamperrin> And by "might be read" I mean "ignored" :-)
[2017-05-04 16:32:01] <grahamperrin> Let's kick the ball around with wording. Here, or the rhubarb room, or the sandbox?
[2017-05-04 16:35:17] <grahamperrin> Or an etherpad-a-majig somewhere? Google Docs collaborative edition? No rush.
[2017-05-04 18:11:20] <schas002> Uh, for@grahamperrinuser popup still shows old image.
[2017-05-04 18:11:41] <schas002> A freehand red circle image is worth ten thousand words:

[2017-05-04 18:21:28] <cbj4074> schas002: Yeah, there's some caching at play there. I've seen it happen in other instances. It will eventually correct itself.
[2017-05-04 20:25:24] <grahamperrin> suprememoocow: or@mydigitalselfplease: of the90K+ Communities, approximately what percentage is GitHub-based?
[2017-05-04 21:17:28] <suprememoocow> grahamperrin: right now, it's about 87% of communities, so fairly high
[2017-05-06 07:38:47] <iancrowther> Wow@mydigitalself, just caught the acquisition article.. huge congratulations to you and the team.. big things
[2017-05-06 23:40:20] <MarcWeber> Hey boys and girls - Why don't you add a feature "List my question during the last 48 hours in a short overview so that I can jump back fast and check for replies?". Not having a well working search is bad. Or can I log to a file and search within that?
[2017-05-07 02:40:58] <grahamperrin> MarcWeber: seekingfrom:MarcWebershould work. Unfortunately GitHub can not tell me whether you are subscribed to [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-05-07 02:42:50] <grahamperrin> … can I log to a file and search within that?
[2017-05-07 02:43:45] <grahamperrin> I'm not aware of an export (to file) feature.
[2017-05-07 02:44:48] <grahamperrin> There's a shared wish for search engines such as Google to find content. I doubt that indexing will be as required until after [<-ISSUE->] is implemented.
[2017-05-07 08:47:45] <grahamperrin> grahamperrin: uses Mozilla Archive Format [<-LINK->] to save a.maffof a 598-item day, [<-LINK->] 
[2017-05-07 08:48:33] <grahamperrin> MarcWeber: please, do you use Firefox?
[2017-05-07 20:35:58] <TitouanT> My issue isn't critical but I change my profile picture and I hover my name in gitter it show's the old one, thought that it might be a question of time but I change it 4 days ago
[2017-05-07 20:39:07] <InternetUnexplorer> TitouanT: Try clearing your cache?
[2017-05-07 20:40:01] <TitouanT> oh ok thanks I didn't think about that :)
[2017-05-08 02:44:46] <grahamperrin> TitouanT: similarly, I changed mine (to the cat) in GitHub on or before Thursday 2017-05-04 and it has not yet appeared in my profile card at Gitter.@InternetUnexplorercache-free reloading is not a workaround. [<-ISSUE->] requires asign out…

[2017-05-08 04:02:50] <sgon00> hi, I am using gitter client in linux. I saw each my post had three dots menu button. Once I double click on it, it shows "delete" button. If I click on "delete", the post is gone in my client. I am just wondering what it really means and happens. Is that gone only in my client? or is that gone in the gitter server too? so people will never  see the deleted posts? thanks.
[2017-05-08 04:08:46] <bigalnz> This might sound like a dumb question
[2017-05-08 04:08:51] <bigalnz> how do I change my emoticon in gitter
[2017-05-08 04:10:27] <InternetUnexplorer> or is that gone in the gitter server too? so people will never see the deleted posts? thanks.@sgon00 It deletes it for everyone.
[2017-05-08 04:11:14] <InternetUnexplorer> bigalnz: If you're talking about your profile picture, it reflects the one you have set in GitHub.If you're not talking about your profile picture, then I am not sure what you are asking.
[2017-05-08 04:12:28] <sgon00> InternetUnexplorer: thank you very much for your reply. I googled this question. Some posts talk about the delete will only work within 5 minutes after sending the message. but in my case, I can delete messages regardless the time taken. Is that expected behavior? thanks.
[2017-05-08 04:15:01] <sgon00> I can not edit a post more than 5 minutes. but I can delete a message more than 5 minutes. is this expected?
[2017-05-08 04:19:52] <InternetUnexplorer> sgon00: I believe it was changed somewhat recently; it used to be you could not delete it. As for editing, I believe the time limit is 10 minutes, but that is only a rough estimate based on what I've seen.
[2017-05-08 04:22:11] <sgon00> InternetUnexplorer: thanks a lot for your answer and reply. I made some dumb question. Just deleted them. it's nice to hear I can delete messages regardless the time taken. :)
[2017-05-08 04:45:35] <grahamperrin> …  I made some dumb question. …
[2017-05-08 04:46:08] <grahamperrin> I saw nothing "dumb". Maybe because you deleted that thing beore I saw it,@sgon00:-)
[2017-05-08 04:47:53] <grahamperrin> In any case, I feel that this room should not require cleverness before asking a question. Much of the admin support that I provide here is simply drawing awareness to features of Gitter, through which a person can find his or her way to a friendly room.
[2017-05-08 04:48:51] <sgon00> grahamperrin: not in this room. I posted the dumb question in another room. I didn't delete all. just delete some msgs which I sent when I lost my mind.
[2017-05-08 04:49:42] <grahamperrin> Ah :-)
[2017-05-08 04:55:59] <sgon00> 
[2017-05-08 05:09:25] <grahamperrin> Away from Gitter: yesterday, I made a huge blooper. Away from the area where I blooped: I [<-LINK->] . (Not as amusing as it might appear, on the surface … off-topic from Gitter support so join me in [<-LINK->] if you like …)
[2017-05-08 05:17:24] <dangetii> 咦？
[2017-05-08 22:22:46] <timsneath> Hello Gitter heroes. A question: is there any way to get some historical stats on activity for a Gitter room? I see that I can go to the archives page and see a heatmap-like view - but I'd really like to be able to show the growth of our Gitter community over time
[2017-05-08 22:23:08] <timsneath> Any easy way to see growth in users, growth in posts to our Gitter room?
[2017-05-08 22:24:12] <timsneath> (We're getting tons of value from Gitter, by the way - our team uses it for the [<-LINK->] and I don't know what we'd do without it...)
[2017-05-08 22:27:43] <InternetUnexplorer> timsneath: I don't know of any built in or 3rd party solution for that at the moment, however the [<-LINK->] if you would like to generate statistics based on that.
[2017-05-08 22:55:31] <timsneath> Thanks,@InternetUnexplorer. Although I don't think I see the APIs I'm looking for. The Room resource doesn't offer historical data on users. The closest I can get to any historical data at all from the API is to download every message from the room (but I can only request 100 messages at a time), and then tabulate posts by time.
[2017-05-08 22:55:46] <timsneath> Let me know if there's something you're seeing that I missed...
[2017-05-09 00:52:36] <artingharibi> Hello-world
[2017-05-09 01:04:06] <grahamperrin> artingharibi: please refrain from testing in the support chat room. If you are a newcomer, please be aware of the sandbox (sandpit) and other rooms. [<-LINK->] should help you to find your way.
[2017-05-09 02:50:55] <InternetUnexplorer> Thanks, @InternetUnexplorer. Although I don't think I see the APIs I'm looking for. The Room resource doesn't offer historical data on users. The closest I can get to any historical data at all from the API is to download every message from the room (but I can only request 100 messages at a time), and then tabulate posts by time.@timsneath I remember someone doing a thing awhile ago, where they essentially grabbed all of the messages and then measured various things such as # of messages per person, etc.However, you're right; it's far from a perfect solution :(
[2017-05-09 02:51:59] <InternetUnexplorer> Gitter is going completely open source this summer, perhaps it can be implemented then...
[2017-05-09 04:28:26] <VishwasShashidhar> are there any rooms for facebook-android-sdk?
[2017-05-09 07:09:01] <grahamperrin> VishwasShashidhar: no such room in search results.
[2017-05-09 07:10:20] <VishwasShashidhar> grahamperrin: Figured so, thanks anyway!
[2017-05-09 09:01:35] <novisecoder> Hey there. I have a very quick question. Im looking for a chat room that talks about c++ android app development with gradle. I havent been able to find one when searching through google and i thought maybe you could help
[2017-05-09 09:08:21] <VishwasShashidhar> novisecoder: Not sure if there’s a dedicated room for that. You could try posting your queries in rus-speaking/android room.
[2017-05-09 09:23:32] <novisecoder> thanks ill try that
[2017-05-09 09:25:33] <novisecoder> its in russian...
[2017-05-09 09:28:16] <aretecode>  [<-CODE->] 
[2017-05-09 09:28:41] <VishwasShashidhar> novisecoder: shit. sorry, my bad! should have seen that. I can’t find any other rooms unfortunately.
[2017-05-09 09:39:30] <grahamperrin> aretecode:  [<-LINK->] for thesearch-labelmilestone, but not all search-related issues are labelled in that way. Other search-related issues include [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-05-09 09:48:57] <aretecode> grahamperrin: cool thanks 
[2017-05-09 14:06:11] <ImaginaryDevelopment> Hi, I had a mention in a gitter chat room, and clicked the little green icon in-browser to jump to it. When I arrived, I didn't see anything there, and now, I have no idea how to find it. Is there a mention history for a room or for me across all rooms somewhere or can I search somehow?
[2017-05-09 14:11:50] <cbj4074> ImaginaryDevelopment: I've seen that happen. Not sure if it's because you've already read it on another device, or just a bug. But you can search for@yournameand mentions should be returned.
[2017-05-09 14:12:12] <ImaginaryDevelopment> in that channel, or here in the ui anywhere across channels?
[2017-05-09 14:13:38] <cbj4074> I believe searching in that manner will show your mentions across all channels. It's a fairly worthless implementation.
[2017-05-09 14:13:46] <cbj4074> (especially given how the results are displayed)
[2017-05-09 14:14:31] <ImaginaryDevelopment> ok, thanks, I found the search box and it did find a mention in that channel that I thought I already read. but I bet that was it.
[2017-05-09 14:15:27] <ImaginaryDevelopment> oh boy, it looks as though it only finds your most recent mention, now that you've mentioned me the search only returns that
[2017-05-09 14:16:12] <ImaginaryDevelopment> oh, no it's per channel, not across channels
[2017-05-09 14:20:49] <cbj4074> Oh, is it? Okay, good to know... the Search needs some work.
[2017-05-09 14:22:20] <InternetUnexplorer> Friendly reminder that when you search "FreeCodeCamp", the first result is gitterHQ/gitter :)
[2017-05-09 14:22:48] <InternetUnexplorer> So, agreed, it does need some work.
[2017-05-09 14:27:12] <cbj4074> Oh, my... seems like exact matches for rooms should take precedence.
[2017-05-10 08:21:18] <RuchaPardhi> HeyIs their any room for android app development?
[2017-05-10 08:24:37] <RuchaPardhi> I found one but dont know in which language they were talking
[2017-05-10 08:28:38] <iamchetanp_twitter> Hi
[2017-05-10 08:28:54] <iamchetanp_twitter> Why my Image is not showing? How can I edit my profile?
[2017-05-10 09:43:16] <lukeab> hey guys, i just installed the linux desktop app (arch AUR version) and there's no hidpi or zoom/scaling options.
[2017-05-10 09:44:14] <lukeab> i've tried the normal ctr+  or scroll whell type
[2017-05-10 12:07:03] <grahamperrin> RuchaPardhi: I see [<-LINK->] – but I should not treat what's tagged as comprehensive (I have no idea who performs the curation, or when things were last curated). Maybe ask in one of those Android rooms whether the people, there, know of a better room for you. Sorry I can't be of more help.
[2017-05-10 12:10:28] <grahamperrin> iamchetanp_twitter: if you point at (hover over) your avatar, then does the card show what's required? Or do you see the generic Gitter avatar in your card?
[2017-05-10 12:10:48] <grahamperrin> (Sometimes, one user's view of things is different from another's view).
[2017-05-10 12:13:55] <grahamperrin> lukeab:  [<-LINK->] – I have not sought what you describe but I have a hunch that it _is the type of issue that you'll find already reported.
[2017-05-10 13:15:25] <lukeab> grahamperrin: yeh found it [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-05-10 16:33:51] <RuchaPardhi> Thanks@grahamperrin
[2017-05-10 18:38:06] <iamchetanp_twitter> grahamperrin: Now I am seeing generic Gitter Avatar
[2017-05-10 21:29:50] <grimwarden> Just wanted to say Thanks so much for the dark theme on the app!!
[2017-05-11 13:00:22] <mydigitalself> @InternetUnexplorerFriendly reminder that when you search "FreeCodeCamp", the first result is gitterHQ/gitteri don't see that - where are you getting that?
[2017-05-11 13:02:55] <cbj4074> I just tried it, too, and I don't see that, either. The official freecodecamp room is indeed first.
[2017-05-11 13:06:35] <mydigitalself> iamchetanp_twitter: twitter was returning a really odd response for your avatar, i've updated manually so should work now
[2017-05-11 13:14:55] <grahamperrin> mydigitalself: I see the updated avater for Chetan on his card but not yet against his messages. Do you see the same?
[2017-05-11 13:15:14] <mydigitalself> did you refresh?
[2017-05-11 13:15:49] <grahamperrin> Yes, skipping cache. [<-ISSUE->] comes to mind, but there's not (yet) any Twitter case in that issue.
[2017-05-11 13:16:23] <mydigitalself> what image url do you see for his chat avatar if you inspect?
[2017-05-11 13:16:55] <mydigitalself> the twitter and the github ones work quite differently
[2017-05-11 13:18:17] <grahamperrin>  [<-CODE->] 
[2017-05-11 13:52:03] <mydigitalself> grahamperrin: it's outputting that, not a URL?
[2017-05-11 13:52:31] <mydigitalself> i get: [<-CODE->] 
[2017-05-11 13:54:34] <grahamperrin>  [<-CODE->] 
[2017-05-11 13:55:30] <mydigitalself> i'm not even sure how that's possible - is your browser doing something funky?
[2017-05-11 13:55:47] <mydigitalself> i.e. embedding image source data into the DOM somehow
[2017-05-11 13:55:48] <grahamperrin> A few extensions, maybe that's the issue.
[2017-05-11 13:56:49] <grahamperrin> Yeah, that's probably it. When I view this room with a less extended Firefox profile, the avatar is OK.
[2017-05-11 14:21:59] <InternetUnexplorer> i don't see that - where are you getting that?@mydigitalself Huh, I remember that from a few months ago when @grahamperrin and I were discussing the huge amount of people coming here from FCC. Perhaps I remembered wrong, or perhaps it's been  fixed...
[2017-05-11 14:26:47] <grahamperrin>  [<-ISSUE->] was Twitter-oriented
[2017-05-11 15:11:10] <akroll222> despite saying I only want emails related to threads I'm following (which should not be the only available option) and not actually following any threads I'm receiving almost 100 emails daily. I left the chat room and changed my settings again and still nothing. This is insanely annoying and there are literally NO options for just not receiving emails at all and the filters you do have don't work.  I don't even see a settings option for just leaving Gitter, this is ridiculous.
[2017-05-11 15:13:57] <cbj4074> akroll222: It's widely understood that the notification system needs a lot of refinement, but I don't get any emails at all, so it's not some universal behavior that can't be stopped.
[2017-05-11 15:14:57] <cbj4074> In other words, I'm confused as to why you can't click the Settings icon (the little slide-toggle thingy at top-right), click Notifications, click Configure Defaults (link at bottom of modal dialog), and uncheck the "Send me email notifications" box.
[2017-05-11 15:15:36] <cbj4074> Almost seems like you have an out-of-date client or something...
[2017-05-11 15:17:20] <mydigitalself> akroll222: change your default setting toMute
[2017-05-11 15:25:52] <mydigitalself> and for the rooms you want email notifications, change that toAllorAnnoucements
[2017-05-11 15:26:32] <akroll222> mydigitalself: i already did both of those
[2017-05-11 15:28:28] <akroll222> cbj4074: i already did that too, that box is unchecked
[2017-05-11 15:29:00] <akroll222> seriously tried all these things and the emails are coming in at an alarming rate.  not only am i not in any of these groups, i removed all of my groups so i shouldn't be getting any thread notifications
[2017-05-11 15:29:35] <cbj4074> Hmm... sounds like a staff-member may need to investigate your specific case, then. :/
[2017-05-11 15:30:21] <akroll222> so far i haven't found a way to contact anyone?
[2017-05-11 15:31:15] <akroll222> why is there no option for just simply not getting any emails at all?  is there a way to just delete my gitter account completely?
[2017-05-11 15:35:32] <cbj4074> There is such an option, but it sounds like you've already unchecked it. Something seems disconnected. Mike Bartlett is a staff-member, so you've already reached one.
[2017-05-11 15:36:18] <akroll222> i just sent an email about closing my account
[2017-05-11 15:37:05] <akroll222> thanks
[2017-05-11 15:38:06] <cbj4074>  Sorry to see you go, though.
[2017-05-11 15:54:34] <mydigitalself> @akroll222 are you sure you don't have a second account with a different username perhaps? feel free to chat with me directly and i can get some details from you to investigate.if you sent a support ticket to close your account, that'll get done, but i'd rather also figure out why you're getting emails when you've changed your settings.
[2017-05-11 15:55:34] <akroll222> i don't know what other account id have.  i set one up 4 or 5 years ago but never received a single email until i started the new one
[2017-05-11 15:55:57] <mydigitalself> DM me the email address that the notifications are being sent to and i can look it up
[2017-05-11 15:57:04] <akroll222> how do i dm?
[2017-05-11 15:57:27] <cbj4074> Hover-over the person's avatar and click Chat Privately.
[2017-05-11 17:29:30] <j113203> hi , i found some issues.if gitter client run some infinity loop script from codepen…..the application or even the whole operating system will stop response..
[2017-05-11 17:30:47] <j113203> ** danager example **http://codepen.io/j113203/pen/eWMVbrthe above example may crash the whole system, RUN PEN carefully
[2017-05-11 17:34:58] <TechPandaa> Tested, gitter instantly crashed for me
[2017-05-11 17:36:08] <j113203> my mac book stop response (eat up all the 16gb ram )
[2017-05-11 17:48:30] <cbj4074> LOL. Good find. I don't dare click on it.
[2017-05-11 18:10:13] <schas002> Okay, so I have conducted some testing with private rooms, with Graham Perrin being the tester.
[2017-05-11 18:10:29] <schas002> Now, talking from his name:
[2017-05-11 18:10:32] <schas002> Given a private room you're a member of, after you leave it, it's found neither in the list of all conversations, nor in search, which is normal. But a 404 appears after you successfully leave (This isn't the chat you're looking for, sorry!) and each time you try to enter the private room.
[2017-05-11 18:10:35] <schas002> It should be better to observe a plain English acknowledgement of departure. Moreover, I would prefer a forewarning that after departure from a private room I can't join it again.
[2017-05-11 18:14:01] <cbj4074> One wonders, then, if the private room implementation relies upon GitHub's API, because what you describe sounds exactly like how private repository access is implemented on GitHub.
[2017-05-11 18:14:33] <cbj4074> For example, if you browse to a repository page to which you lack access, you receive a 404 (not a more "friendly" message, and there are good reasons for this).
[2017-05-11 18:15:07] <cbj4074> Or, if you leave an organization that grants you access to a private repository, you cannot simply re-join the organization at your whim.
[2017-05-12 02:08:55] <wrathagom> Hey all, just installed gitter on my linux machine and I'm not finding a way to hide the menubar. Anyway to do this? Most apps allow it to be hidden and usealtto show it. Purely cosmetic question.
[2017-05-12 08:06:29] <peppesapienza> Hi guys, there is in plane the capability for guest to write some message?
[2017-05-12 09:04:34] <mydigitalself> wrathagom: i don't believe we have that capability. the desktop app is built on nw.js and is available as open source at [<-LINK->] 
[2017-05-12 09:05:46] <mydigitalself> peppesapienza: i don't understand your question. any member of the room using GitHub or Twitter logins can participate.
[2017-05-12 09:55:33] <schas002> mydigitalself: What if you can't/don't want to log in using GitHub or Twitter but still want to chat on Gitter?
[2017-05-12 09:55:57] <schas002> That's how I understood it.
[2017-05-12 09:56:02] <mydigitalself> there's no option for that
[2017-05-12 10:19:02] <jdmcwhinnie> Create community in app is not working
[2017-05-12 10:19:18] <jdmcwhinnie> iPhone
[2017-05-12 10:19:52] <schas002> jdmcwhinnie: What's it say?
[2017-05-12 10:20:14] <jdmcwhinnie> It just doesn't do anything
[2017-05-12 10:20:36] <jdmcwhinnie> You push and push but nothing
[2017-05-12 10:22:14] <jdmcwhinnie> It's the create and finish button
[2017-05-14 17:14:35] <eckes_twitter> Hello, is there some iPad/Safari support for shift+enter/ctrl+enter for inserting lines in chatmode and sending the message in compose mode?
[2017-05-14 21:52:28] <eckes_twitter> Hello, is there some iPad/Safari support for shift+enter/ctrl+enter for inserting lines in chatmode and sending the message in compose mode?I submited this as a support question now. Thanks
[2017-05-15 18:26:41] <akroll222> how can i  delete my account?
[2017-05-15 20:00:42] <MadLittleMods> akroll222:  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-05-16 12:18:50] <akroll222> hello.  ive sent a few messages on here and 2 emails to support and im getting no replies.  im getting hundreds of emails from freecodecamp yet im not actually in any of the groups.  im getting very annoyed and would like to delete my account.  Someone please help!  Thank you.
[2017-05-16 12:25:20] <Reinoud-Zuyderhoff> akroll222: i know how you feel, i've been getting a lot of e-mails as well. yet i didn't want tot delete my account entirely. so i set my preferences to not wanting to receive anything, and now i don't actually receive anything.
[2017-05-16 12:56:56] <cbj4074> Reinoud-Zuyderhoff: He tried that but disabling does not seem to work.@mydigitalselfwas supposed to look into it... like a week ago.
[2017-05-16 12:57:12] <cbj4074> (sorry to name names, but I'd be pretty frustrated, too!)
[2017-05-16 13:01:30] <Reinoud-Zuyderhoff> cbj4074: i can imagine, i thought it be fun to part of such a community but the constant stream of e-mail drove me crazy to. really sucks if you can't turn it off.
[2017-05-16 13:06:07] <cbj4074> I think his case is a true anomaly. I turned it off and I don't receive any.
[2017-05-16 13:06:14] <cbj4074> And I've never heard anyone else say they can't turn it off.
[2017-05-16 13:06:45] <cbj4074> I suspect that he has two accounts or there is some weirdness behind the scenes.
[2017-05-16 13:08:14] <Reinoud-Zuyderhoff> cbj4074: i wanted to ask that, if there were several e-mail adresses in one account or something. but i figured he's probably passed that
[2017-05-16 13:10:02] <cbj4074> I think it's the other way round, that he has two different usernames that share the same email address
[2017-05-16 13:10:22] <cbj4074> And he doesn't know what the first username is, so he can't reset the password, log in with that account, and disable the notifications.
[2017-05-16 13:10:42] <cbj4074> akroll222: Per ^, what happens if you try to reset your password?
[2017-05-16 13:10:46] <cbj4074> Do you get two different emails?
[2017-05-16 13:30:38] <mydigitalself> akroll222: we established via our email conversation that those notifications where in factGitHubnotifications, not from Gitter. Remember Gitter is not GitHub is not FreeCodeCamp...
[2017-05-16 13:31:19] <cbj4074>  Well, that paints it all in a very different light.
[2017-05-16 13:31:26] <akroll222> yes i remember i sent this before that conversation was read and responded to.  all set, thank you for the help
[2017-05-16 15:30:00] <sgon00> Hi, I have set the Notifications to "Notify me for mentions and announcement" in gitter client. why do gitter keep sending me Notification emails for all unread messages? I just want to receive email notification when my name is @ (mentioned) or any announcements and I don't want to receive emails for all unread msgs. thanks.
[2017-05-16 16:06:39] <mydigitalself> sgon00: email notifications work a bit different to desktop notifications (long story) - if you set your notification settings toMuteyou will only receive email notifications for @ mentions .
[2017-05-16 16:07:48] <sgon00> mydigitalself: thanks a lot for this tip. I will set all rooms to mute then. I am getting headache to receive many notification emails everyday.
[2017-05-17 06:31:01] <thebombzen> Is there any way to disable the s/a/b/ behavior
[2017-05-17 06:31:10] <thebombzen> it exists on discordapp and it's very annoying
[2017-05-17 06:31:21] <thebombzen> if we want to fix typos we already could hit the up arrow
[2017-05-17 06:32:01] <thebombzen> when I saw that this anti-feature was added to gitter I was very disappointed
[2017-05-17 08:58:18] <mydigitalself> thebombzen: it was in gitter since the very beginning (4+ years) and has been one of our most loved and popular features. there isn't a way to disable it. i have to be honest, you are the very first person to express this opinion.
[2017-05-17 10:01:39] <thebombzen> mydigitalself: huh. because everyone I talk toohatesthe feature on Discord. I haven't used gitter until recently
[2017-05-17 10:08:04] <thebombzen> Another question: sometimes the icon will disappear upon responding
[2017-05-17 10:08:13] <thebombzen> is this a known bug? It appears for a second and then disappears
[2017-05-17 10:08:21] <thebombzen> putting in a second or third message will cause it to reappear again
[2017-05-17 10:09:03] <thebombzen> This is what it looks like sometimes: [<-LINK->] 
[2017-05-17 10:09:42] <thebombzen> Whereas this is what it should look like: [<-LINK->] 
[2017-05-17 21:51:04] <kentonraiford> Hey, I'm not sure if this is the right chat for this but I haven't received my email with confirmation instructions and I keep retrying. It's been months.
[2017-05-17 22:07:52] <thebombzen> stupid question - checked spam?
[2017-05-17 22:37:44] <kentonraiford> Lol yes
[2017-05-18 03:55:34] <thebombzen> Wow, they really ought to make the MOTD more clear
[2017-05-18 04:43:49] <InternetUnexplorer> ...more clear than a giant bold message which appears when you join the room,@thebombzen?
[2017-05-18 04:44:10] <thebombzen> idk, I was just commenting on the number of people who come in here and ignore it.
[2017-05-18 04:44:15] <InternetUnexplorer> Ertonts: Please move your message to gitterHQ/developers.
[2017-05-18 04:44:42] <thebombzen> Either way, is the disappearing avatar bug a known bug
[2017-05-18 04:44:50] <thebombzen> or should I file a report on it
[2017-05-18 04:45:26] <InternetUnexplorer> thebombzen: I would check the GitHub and open an issue if you can't find one for it.
[2017-05-18 04:46:12] <InternetUnexplorer> Also, if you have suggestions on improving the welcome message, you're welcome to post them here.
[2017-05-18 04:49:22] <thebombzen> Found it. It's known and recent
[2017-05-18 09:21:32] <mkborregaard> Hi, I've just opened a chatroom for a GitHub organisation and added all the members of the organisation. Except one - one of the owners of the organisation did not appear when I opened the room. I've tried searching and adding him manually, but Gitter responds with "forbidden". He has no idea why that is. He cannot find the organisation chatroom while searching, nor access it by going to the chatroom URL. When I go to "people" under the organisation on GitHub he appears there completely normally. He uses Gitter regularly in all kinds of other chatrooms. Is this a bug, or a missing setting / permission somewhere? Thanks!
[2017-05-18 10:49:23] <mkborregaard> Please let me know if there's a more appropriate place to go for support on this. Thank you!
[2017-05-18 15:17:23] <thebombzen> This is a test of the disappearing avatar bug
[2017-05-18 15:17:41] <thebombzen> Nope, doesn't occur in browser.
[2017-05-18 15:18:32] <MadLittleMods> @thebombzen Better to use https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/sandbox or your own private room^ ref for that issue, gitterHQ/gitter#1700
[2017-05-18 15:18:47] <thebombzen> Didn't know about that. Thx
[2017-05-18 15:19:22] <thebombzen> And yes, I'm aware of that issue. ^_^
[2017-05-18 15:25:19] <mkborregaard> Hi friends, any of you have any clue about the inability to add the organization owner to the organization chat room?
[2017-05-18 15:27:31] <mkborregaard> AFAICS I did read all of the relevant gitter support articles before posting
[2017-05-18 15:29:56] <MadLittleMods> mkborregaard: When you invite someone to a room, we check from their perspective whether they can join. Make sure their org membership is public or they have allowed private repo access ( [<-CODE->] )
[2017-05-18 15:31:12] <mkborregaard> It is indeed a private member, but there are two other private owners so I didn't think that was the thing - I'll try it! :-)
[2017-05-18 15:34:27] <mkborregaard> I've upgraded the access and pinged him - fingers crossed!
[2017-05-18 16:38:33] <TitouanT> hello ! a /slap command could be fun ! bye !
[2017-05-18 16:46:33] <mkborregaard> Thanks@MadLittleMods, we're in!
[2017-05-18 23:17:48] <InternetUnexplorer> john_mcnam_twitter: Wrong room. Read the message you get before joining next time.
[2017-05-19 10:05:02] <VUross> Hello World... gitter is better for real... C U all after finishing some chapters... trying to do all by the book and my exp is helping to understan.

[2017-05-19 10:15:21] <grahamperrin> VUross: hi, did you join this room with a mobile client? Or with a desktop web browser?
[2017-05-19 10:25:18] <grahamperrin> eckes_twitter: please, where did you post your question?
[2017-05-19 10:26:03] <grahamperrin> eckes_twitter: also please see thismobileissue: [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-05-19 10:30:50] <grahamperrin> thebombzen: I see your [<-LINK->] – thanks. OK to delete [<-LINK->] and the related messages that were made before the issue was found?
[2017-05-19 10:34:59] <grahamperrin> thebombzen: also you might like to subscribe to [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-05-19 14:50:42] <GerbenW_twitter> Hi when signing in with Twitter en trying to create a room i keep getting a 500
[2017-05-19 14:59:05] <GerbenW_twitter> App seems to work ok.
[2017-05-19 16:17:41] <nicolelaine> Hello, is this gitter support?
[2017-05-19 16:22:47] <InternetUnexplorer> nicolelaine: yes, details were in the message you saw when you joined the room, as well as at the top of your window.
[2017-05-19 16:25:48] <nicolelaine> Great, I’m having trouble changing my Gitter notifications. I’m in the app for OS X, not the browser, there is no apply button, I have tried a full restart, as well as trashing and redownloading and installing the app - do you know what could be going wrong?
[2017-05-19 22:18:49] <InternetUnexplorer> Hello ..I have problem with soar coin transaction ..can anybody help me?@halim506 Your message was deleted because you posted it in the wrong room. Please pay attention to the messages you get when joining a room in the future.
[2017-05-19 22:21:31] <InternetUnexplorer> The appropriate room for your question is most likely gitterHQ/developers.
[2017-05-20 07:16:41] <lestat1234_twitter> hello, is it possible to change background colors and fonts/sizes?
[2017-05-20 12:19:15] <grahamperrin> lestat1234_twitter: there's a dark theme, have you tried that?
[2017-05-20 12:36:38] <anees_khanzada_twitter> grahamperrin: can i download gitter
[2017-05-20 12:36:55] <anees_khanzada_twitter> please suggest me a link to download giiter repo
[2017-05-20 15:09:08] <InternetUnexplorer> anees_khanzada_twitter: That is not currently possible, as Gitter is closed source.
[2017-05-20 15:10:12] <InternetUnexplorer> However, the source will be made available later this year. More info is available on the Gitter blog about this.
[2017-05-20 16:22:26] <InternetUnexplorer> amarg26: I've deleted your messages, as I see you've already posted your question in gitterHQ/developers. Please make sure you are in the right room before posting next time.
[2017-05-20 17:30:35] <lestat1234_twitter> grahamperrin: thank you found it
[2017-05-20 23:06:16] <eckes_twitter> grahamperrin: thanks for the link to the issue, seems very much related. (I sent support request via the FAQ thing, but it's ok if no response)
[2017-05-21 12:29:12] <jdmcwhinnie> Community add fixed on iPhone.  Thank you
[2017-05-21 12:30:12] <jdmcwhinnie> Next problem though!  The community I added on iPhone is not on the website when I access it on Linux
[2017-05-21 13:13:28] <eckes_twitter> nicolelaine: when I use the dot menu on the upper right and change the notifications it does remember the setting without apply button. That's normal for iOS apps. Just push the left arrow in the heading to leave the menu and it will remember the setting (at least in my case I changed from All to Anouncements)
[2017-05-21 13:14:24] <eckes_twitter> (Can't post images here :-/)
[2017-05-21 19:14:07] <akroll222> i uninstal;ed gitter from my computer but this pop up wont stop appearing.  does anyone have any idea how to get rid of it?
[2017-05-21 20:06:55] <grahamperrin> akroll222: which operating system?
[2017-05-21 20:18:10] <InternetUnexplorer> akroll222: If you're on Windows, try opening Task Manager, click on the "Startup" tab, and disable the Gitter app there.
[2017-05-22 05:56:21] <jagui113> I am using Gitter's sidecar chat room tab on a website. the flyout window opens to a 404 error page and not my community chat room. (1) is this how it works ? (2) on the chat room tab, it reads "Chat Room" - can this be changed to state something else? (3) the 404 error flyout page - instead of the "404 error" text, can the text be changed to something else, like "to use this chat room a gitter account is required" ?
[2017-05-22 12:08:00] <ImTheDeveloper_twitter> Hi, I changed my username on GitHub, signed out of gitter and now I cant sign in with it unless I use twitter:
[2017-05-22 12:08:07] <ImTheDeveloper_twitter> We're very sorry, but we're unable to log you in right now. 
(E11000 duplicate key error collection: gitter.users index: githubId_1 dup key: { : 1431348 })
[2017-05-22 13:03:12] <mydigitalself> jagui113: is the room a private room? sidecar only works on public rooms - what room did you specify in the javasdcript?
[2017-05-22 13:03:51] <mydigitalself> kentonraiford: what confirmation instructions?
[2017-05-22 13:05:45] <mydigitalself> ImTheDeveloper_twitter: whats your old and new GitHub username?
[2017-05-22 13:07:42] <ImTheDeveloper_twitter> Old one was@hardware_hacksnew one is@imthedeveloper
[2017-05-22 13:16:35] <mydigitalself> ImTheDeveloper_twitter: ok, fixed. changing your github username is the enemy of their API. especially if someone else had previously used the same name and signed up to gitter.
[2017-05-22 13:17:03] <grahamperrin> Is there, currently, any difference between Current and Next?
[2017-05-22 13:17:28] <grahamperrin> (Last I heard,chat-cachewas not recommended. That aside, I never noticed any difference.)
[2017-05-22 13:20:42] <mydigitalself> grahamperrin: yes and no - nothing noticeable, but next is currently running the pre-release open sourced "version" of Gitter
[2017-05-22 13:21:34] <ImTheDeveloper_twitter> mydigitalself: Thanks. Just a sign out and back in for me now?
[2017-05-22 13:21:45] <mydigitalself> yip
[2017-05-22 13:21:55] <mydigitalself> giant in theory in air quotes
[2017-05-22 13:22:06] <ImTheDeveloper_twitter> 
[2017-05-22 13:23:02] <ImTheDeveloper> Worked thank you
[2017-05-22 13:24:36] <mydigitalself> cool
[2017-05-22 13:40:56] <grahamperrin> grahamperrin: thanks@mydigitalself
[2017-05-22 22:44:17] <blackbox0416> 。。。
[2017-05-22 23:14:55] <InternetUnexplorer> Do you have a Gitter support question?
[2017-05-23 04:14:09] <dotuan9x> hello
[2017-05-23 04:15:30] <InternetUnexplorer> dotuan9x: Hello, what is your Gitter support question?
[2017-05-23 06:55:52] <ghost~54d9064815522ed4b3dbce41> why can I not add members of my organization to my room?

[2017-05-23 07:04:37] <Dcoke1> Hey Guys, I got a question....Whenever I upload my Repo to github, the html  doesn't load up it only types the name of my repo on the heading on the page...Any  suggestions ?
[2017-05-23 07:43:56] <jagui113> mydigitalself: , hi,no my sidecar room is not private - im pretty sure. when you ask "did you specify in the javascript" are you saying i am able to specify in the script?.. i'll check it out. I basiclly just copied pasted the script from the sidecar gitter page. . . .
[2017-05-23 07:45:25] <jagui113> once in the room, i entered the 'settings' and kept the "only github users" checkbox, unchecked.i thinking thats what open/not private means
[2017-05-23 08:32:24] <thebombzen> grahamperrin: it's okay to delete it, but I don't see why it's necessary
[2017-05-23 08:32:54] <thebombzen> it sounds like a bad idea to delete old text messages just because they reference a bug that has been officially tracked elsewhere
[2017-05-23 08:33:14] <thebombzen> Keeping text logs sounds like a much better idea than deleting them once they stop being immediately relevant
[2017-05-23 09:18:17] <izuzak> @MadLittleModsI'm Ivan from GitHub. We're doing a workshop (building a chatbot) and wethinkour user got blocked: billyyumyum2x2
[2017-05-23 11:36:46] <lydatech> MadLittleMods: are you about?
[2017-05-23 11:42:03] <bhaugen> This morning, we had a rude shock. This gitter room was gone: [<-LINK->] 
[2017-05-23 11:42:37] <bhaugen> It now appears as a community, with several rooms within it, but the main room, with that URL, is no longer a chat room.
[2017-05-23 11:43:38] <bhaugen> Did we do something stupid? Did somebody hack us on purpose? Is this a gitter change in some way? Can we get it back with the contents it had yesterday?
[2017-05-23 11:44:04] <bhaugen> (That URL above was from a notification email.)
[2017-05-23 12:24:07] <grahamperrin> I get a 404 response for [<-LINK->] 
[2017-05-23 12:25:00] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] also 404
[2017-05-23 12:55:46] <TheJaredWilcurt> MadLittleMods: this person is posting spam in lots of rooms:
[2017-05-23 12:55:49] <TheJaredWilcurt>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-05-23 12:56:29] <bhaugen> I get a 404 response for https://gitter.im/valueflows/valueflowsMe too, now. Earlier this morning I got a community, but not a chat room.
[2017-05-23 13:02:26] <bhaugen> Sorry, I probably made this confusing. [<-LINK->] is a community with several chat rooms.One of the chat rooms was also called valueflows, [<-LINK->] that's the one that is now missing.
[2017-05-23 13:02:35] <bhaugen> It had been a very active chat room.
[2017-05-23 13:38:27] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-05-23 14:32:02] <InternetUnexplorer> bhaugen: I would directly contact Gitter staff immediately.
[2017-05-23 14:33:06] <bhaugen> InternetUnexplorer: (love your handle) I thought I was doing that here. I'll do it more directly.
[2017-05-23 14:34:11] <InternetUnexplorer> You can PM mydigitalself or madlittlemods, they are Gitter staff.
[2017-05-23 14:35:05] <InternetUnexplorer> That is probably the most direct way (also, thanks :)).
[2017-05-23 15:53:32] <mydigitalself> izuzak: i've unblocked that account,  it probably got picked up my spam detection algo's
[2017-05-23 15:53:41] <mydigitalself> ping me if you want any more details
[2017-05-23 15:57:54] <mydigitalself> bhaugen: someone may have deleted the room, we certainly have no record of it. are you sure that's the right URL, your README points to [<-LINK->] 
[2017-05-23 16:20:22] <bhaugen>  [<-LINK->] is our newbie-friendlier welcome room. [<-LINK->] was the hard core detailed discussion.
[2017-05-23 16:22:54] <bhaugen> We're asking if anybody in the group deleted it. Worst case, we'll set up another unfriendier room, but it would be good to know what happened, if possible. Maybe not possible...
[2017-05-23 16:23:19] <bhaugen> But we harvest anything we want to keep out of the chat, so no big loss of work.
[2017-05-23 16:46:37] <mydigitalself> will try dig into a bit deeper, i just look at the db and it wasn't there. when deleting room we ask for explicit confirmation and then permanently delete. will try see if there's a recent log activity around it
[2017-05-23 17:11:09] <bhaugen> I also just tried to create a new room in the valueflows community [<-LINK->] using the ADD A ROOM button. When I click the CREATE button, it does nothing.
[2017-05-23 17:12:52] <bhaugen> I'm wondering if somebody changed our previous valueflows room into a community, and that's why the chat went away. Do you think that is possible? (Especially given your comments about delete confirmation, somebody would need to have done it on purpose.)
[2017-05-23 18:40:23] <TheGhostHuCodes> Hi there, I'm a new gitter user that signed up through github. I kind of expected my name to be displayedYung-Jin (Joey) Hu #TheGhostHuCodes
[2017-05-23 18:41:40] <TheGhostHuCodes> but as you can see above, it's displayed asThe Ghost Hu Codes @TheGhostHuCodes, does gitter cache the name somewhere and it's not getting refreshed?
[2017-05-23 19:00:45] <bhaugen> will try dig into a bit deeper, i just look at the db and it wasn't there. when deleting room we ask for explicit confirmation and then permanently delete. will try see if there's a recent log activity around it@mydigitalself We did an experiment: creating a room in a different community. Worked fine. But we can't create new rooms in the valueflows community. So we wonder again if what happened is that somebody changed the valueflows chat room into a community, and now that community no longer works to create new rooms. Is that possible?If not, why can't we create a new chat room in the valueflows community?
[2017-05-23 19:22:35] <Redem40> Done
[2017-05-23 22:31:47] <InternetUnexplorer> vlada140: I have deleted your messages, as this room is for Gitter support only. Please make sure you are in the right room before posting next time.
[2017-05-24 04:14:37] <grahamperrin> thebombzen:  [<-LINK->] noted with thanks, I'll happily leave the messages.
[2017-05-24 04:15:55] <thebombzen> I shouldn't have to tell the mods to leave textlogs
[2017-05-24 04:16:05] <thebombzen> Seems like it should be pretty clear
[2017-05-24 04:19:13] <grahamperrin> Apologies, Leo. It's sometimes a grey area.
[2017-05-24 04:19:26] <thebombzen> No, not really.
[2017-05-24 04:20:32] <thebombzen> It's only gray if there's actually a reason to delete them. Say, if they contain sensitive information. In this case it's pretty clear that history should not be erased.
[2017-05-24 05:33:42] <dogancelik> Hey
[2017-05-24 05:33:46] <dogancelik> Gitter should stop automatically submitting the image I'm uploading without my confirmation to the chat
[2017-05-24 05:34:45] <thebombzen> You mean how if you paste an image from the clipboard into gitter chat, it automatically uploads it without asking you?
[2017-05-24 05:34:57] <thebombzen> It shouldn't do that, yes. It might be intended but it is annoying.
[2017-05-24 05:36:04] <dogancelik> Drag / drop file and it posts to channel without me editing it first
[2017-05-24 05:37:33] <dogancelik> When I want to post an image, I want to get image markup first then edit and add it in my previous message
[2017-05-24 05:37:56] <thebombzen> Well Gitter is not an image editor. Use GIMP or something.
[2017-05-24 05:38:02] <dogancelik> You don't understand
[2017-05-24 05:38:06] <dogancelik> I'm just saying it shouldn't post without my confirmation
[2017-05-24 05:38:22] <dogancelik> "Edit" as in editing markdown, not editing image
[2017-05-24 05:39:10] <thebombzen> Oh okay yea. It should ask before uploading. Even if you select an image in the file dialog it should ask. It's very useful if you accidentally misclick, mispaste, etc. to have a preview of the image before
[2017-05-24 05:39:14] <dogancelik> I repeat what you said in your first message, it shouldn't post image without my confirmation.It should do as in Github, paste image code, don't click "Comment / Post" button for me
[2017-05-24 06:27:31] <lars20070> A collaborator of mine wants to join a private chat room of a private repository. He has unlimited free private repositories in GitHub, is member of the private organization and allowed Gitter access to GitHub. Yet he cannot seeGitter Private Repo Accessin his GitHub settings and therefore cannot enable the private chat room. What next? Any advice?
[2017-05-24 08:55:23] <mydigitalself> lars20070: it's not a GitHub setting, googling "Gitter Private Repo Access" gives the instructions here: [<-LINK->] 
[2017-05-24 09:00:08] <mydigitalself> bhaugen: you can't convert a room into a community, any room effectively has a parent community. is whoever is trying to create the community a member of thevalueflowsGitHub org and what is the output of: [<-LINK->] 
[2017-05-24 11:46:20] <bhaugen>  [<-CODE->] "No Organization Owned Applications"
[2017-05-24 11:47:14] <bhaugen> We have a github organization, do we need to register it there? (But I wonder how we created those other rooms within the valueflows community...?)
[2017-05-24 12:34:16] <mydigitalself> bhaugen: what about [<-LINK->] 
[2017-05-24 12:35:22] <mydigitalself> ah, github have moved the org's oauth apps around since the app store launch a couple of days ago
[2017-05-24 12:35:50] <mydigitalself> https://github.com/settings/applicationsif you go there, then find any Gitter apps, click on them to see if they've been granted access to your org
[2017-05-24 12:49:37] <bhaugen> I see Gitter Public Repo AccessLast used within the last day · Owned by gitterHQ
[2017-05-24 12:50:17] <bhaugen> @bhaugen what about https://github.com/organizations/valueflows/settings/oauth_application_policyThat says "Policy: Access restricted "
[2017-05-24 12:50:51] <mydigitalself> and when you go back to your own application settings where you see Gitter Public Repo Access and click on it, you should see a list or orgs that's authorised for
[2017-05-24 14:53:24] <bhaugen> Ok, wasn't granted for valueflows. Done now. Let's see if I can create a new room now...
[2017-05-24 14:56:21] <bhaugen> Yes!   Thank you very much!
[2017-05-24 14:56:46] <mydigitalself> somebody must have removed that, otherwise you wouldn't have been able to have created rooms in the first place
[2017-05-24 15:03:29] <grahamperrin> Does the disappearance of the original [<-LINK->] remain a mystery?
[2017-05-24 15:15:50] <mydigitalself> pretty much, but it looks like someone must have revoked some permissions, so perhaps someone also deleted the room intentionally?
[2017-05-24 16:06:53] <bhaugen> I'll check into the permissions situation when I get time, probably tomorrow. Looks like something was changed, either in github permissions setup, or gitter, or in our github org permissions.
[2017-05-24 16:11:07] <mydigitalself> we can't change the setting in GitHub, we don't have access to those settings through the API
[2017-05-24 16:35:42] <ashlandsimpson> hi
[2017-05-24 20:00:53] <bhaugen> we can't change the setting in GitHub, we don't have access to those settings through the APII wouldn't expect or even want you to do that. Your explaining how was good enuf.
[2017-05-24 20:02:06] <bhaugen> I think something was changed in the permissions flow, though - maybe github made some changes - because we could and did add new rooms before, and then we couldn't until I changed the permissions following your advice.
[2017-05-24 20:36:38] <maks167> hi
[2017-05-24 20:45:46] <InternetUnexplorer> maks167: Hi, welcome to the Gitter support room. Do you have a question?
[2017-05-24 20:46:02] <maks167> no
[2017-05-24 20:46:18] <maks167> just wanted to say hi because i have no life and no friends
[2017-05-24 20:47:40] <InternetUnexplorer> Ok, please do that elsewhere. This room is for Gitter support only.
[2017-05-24 23:30:18] <atanasoaeiflorin> Hello!
[2017-05-24 23:31:13] <InternetUnexplorer> atanasoaeiflorin: Hi, welcome to the Gitter support room. Do you have a question?
[2017-05-24 23:33:34] <atanasoaeiflorin> Who are you?
[2017-05-25 01:06:23] <demhydraz> Automated bot.
[2017-05-25 01:14:25] <InternetUnexplorer> I post the same greeting twice, and now I'm a bot. Neat.
[2017-05-25 01:45:06] <hengyuanma> Captain please? How can I exit a chat and delete it from my chatroom list?
[2017-05-25 02:07:35] <grahamperrin> hengyuanma: three dots alongside the name of the room, click to reveal the option toLeave. Does leaving de-list the room?
[2017-05-25 05:38:59] <jagui113> @InternetUnexplorerGitter is to be supportive - but not socially supportive?
[2017-05-25 05:41:30] <jagui113> @hengyuanmai think to exit a chatroom and delete it from your left hand panel, you first need to enter the chatroom you wish to exit. seek out the settings icon (top right corner) and check the  "i never want to leave or delete this chatroom again" checkbox.
[2017-05-25 06:22:08] <grahamperrin> maks167: @jagui113on one hand, there's this, whichshouldbe seen and read at the time of joining this room:
[2017-05-25 06:22:16] <grahamperrin> Don't just say "hello" and expect everyone to take time out of their life to say "hello" back.
[2017-05-25 06:23:20] <grahamperrin> On the other hand, that guidance mightnotbe seen by some newcomers.
[2017-05-25 06:28:25] <grahamperrin> InternetUnexplorer: if you have not already done so, please subscribe to [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-05-25 06:41:13] <grahamperrin> Under [<-LINK->] , the third screenshot shows that with some desktop browser window sizes, it's possible to join the room without observing the relevant part of the guidance.
[2017-05-25 10:34:59] <jagui113> grahamperrin: that sentence is hard to interpret - even for a LVL 180 Grand Master Hunter /Warlock like myself.
[2017-05-25 10:40:14] <grahamperrin> :-)
[2017-05-25 10:43:02] <grahamperrin> jagui113: I like the "Fancy chatting with us?" sentence at [<-LINK->] 
[2017-05-25 10:45:31] <grahamperrin> I'm not a huge fan of Zendesk, but that phrase "Fancy chatting with us?" – for this room – is short, sweet, welcoming.
[2017-05-25 13:26:47] <salvocostahack> hi
[2017-05-25 13:27:13] <grahamperrin> salvocostahack: hi, do you have a Gitter support question?
[2017-05-26 07:30:10] <jsartisan> i don't know how i got here. i think i got abducted.
[2017-05-26 15:28:20] <InternetUnexplorer> ninjakittyx23: This room is for Gitter support only. Please check you are in the right room before posting next time.
[2017-05-26 22:22:40] <MadLittleMods> GnstheGrain: You can't. You can use [<-LINK->] or create your own private room

[2017-05-26 22:25:07] <MadLittleMods> GnstheGrain: You can create a community for yourself namedGnstheGrain. Then create a private room under that,sandbox. This will get youGnstheGrain/sandbox

[2017-05-27 18:57:32] <Ellyria> Hey there. I've been using Gitter for a while now and have a wish for a small change to the interface. I'd love it if there was a setting I could turn on that makes it so that, when I click on someone's name in the chat and the name gets inserted into my text box, that it not have any white space after it. I realize some people like the white space being added, but since I often insert names in-line with punctuation after them, I'd prefer to have full control over what comes immediately after the name without having to backspace or arrow over and delete the unwanted space first. Is there any chance such a thing could happen? Or is there a keyboard combination that would do it?
[2017-05-27 19:00:18] <MadLittleMods> Ellyria: Unlikely to happen in the near-term. I could see it being a little auto-magical where mentions in the beginning of a message have a space while the rest don't.
[2017-05-27 19:02:43] <Ellyria> Yes, that would be nice,@MadLittleMods. At least now I've voiced it, though, and perhaps the Powers That Be will see it and decide it's a good idea.
[2017-05-28 05:52:32] <grahamperrin> Ellyria:  [<-LINK->] if you'd like to make the enhancement request. Keyword:mention
[2017-05-28 10:31:18] <thenanobel> Is Gitter for Android an open source software?
[2017-05-28 10:46:19] <grahamperrin> thenanobel:  [<-LINK->] no repository forAndroidormobile, so I guess not.
[2017-05-28 10:46:42] <grahamperrin> More generally, there is a transition to open source.

[2017-05-28 18:46:30] <InternetUnexplorer> IIRC it's a pun. Twitter for git/github.
[2017-05-28 19:09:40] <clmay> Hey folks, I tried to search support.gitter.im and the topics section (actually, I couldn't find a search feature that was local to topics). When I click my profile in the upper-right and then "Allow private repo access", nothing happens, and there's no indication whatwouldhappen. This happens on both Chrome and the Mac desktop app. Where should I report this?

[2017-05-31 01:28:41] <grahamperrin> Rupples64: try  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-05-31 01:33:25] <grahamperrin> and for support with [<-LINK->] , please contact Roxio; not Gitter support. Thanks.
[2017-05-31 01:34:49] <InternetUnexplorer> grahamperrin: IIRCtoast.exeis the name of the executable that handles notifications for Gitter for Windows. I remember having to remove it separately when I uninstalled, as it kept sending me notifications.
[2017-05-31 01:36:09] <grahamperrin> grahamperrin: thanks@InternetUnexplorer
[2017-05-31 01:40:36] <grahamperrin> I don't have Windows 10, re: [<-LINK->] if it's a feature of Windows I should hesitate before removal.
[2017-05-31 01:42:33] <grahamperrin>  [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-05-31 01:50:12] <InternetUnexplorer> @Rupples64First, make sure Gitter is closed.Next, uninstall Gitter:Find Gitter in the "Startup" tab of Task Manager:...go up a directory......and delete the directory. [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] This should remove all traces of Gitter from your computer.
[2017-05-31 01:53:05] <grahamperrin> That's great, want to raise an issue?
[2017-05-31 02:07:25] <InternetUnexplorer> Perhaps, though I'm quite busy at the moment. I'll try later when I have more time.
[2017-05-31 05:15:45] <nalamelumangai> While we are busy; history is made somewhere.
[2017-05-31 06:35:39] <aolko> hey there
[2017-05-31 06:35:56] <aolko> where's  "mark all as read"?
[2017-05-31 08:45:55] <RajaputraJeethu_twitter> RajaputraJeethu_twitter: HI ALLI am new to Materialize......:-)After Selecting date in date control the date popup is not disabling untill unless when clicking outside of the popup....can any one give me a better solution
[2017-05-31 09:03:25] <grahamperrin> Hi@RajaputraJeethu_twitterthis room is to support Gitter, not to support Materialize.
[2017-05-31 09:03:50] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] – may help you to find an appropriate room.

[2017-05-31 09:33:38] <mydigitalself> aolko: the (x) button on the unread counter in the top right of the room will mark all as read
[2017-05-31 12:40:24] <bhaugen> pretty much, but it looks like someone must have revoked some permissions, so perhaps someone also deleted the room intentionally?@mydigitalself - new news on our missing chat room. It's not missing. It's just that some of us had our memberships deleted, so we got 404's. And I also misremembered the exact URL. We got invited back by people who were still members of the room, and all seems to be well for the moment. We
[2017-05-31 12:41:04] <bhaugen> We don't know how the memberships got deleted, though.
[2017-05-31 14:27:05] <InternetUnexplorer> ssujit2006: You are in the wrong room, this room is for Gitter support only. Please check that you are in the right room before posting next time.
[2017-05-31 16:19:05] <lifyd> Anyone know how I can enable dark mode (like on desktop) in the iOS version of Gitter?
[2017-05-31 16:50:41] <InternetUnexplorer> lifyd: AFAIK there isn't a dark theme for the app at the moment.

[2017-05-31 18:28:03] <ajuhos> hi, what does "Members of ... can join this room" mean? I have attached a Github Org to the community, but my org members cannot see rooms with this option enabled and I don't see a way to add members to the community...
[2017-05-31 19:41:08] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @grahamperrinSame applies for iOS but should probably have its own issue as it would be separate pieces of work
[2017-05-31 19:42:54] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @ajuhosYou can only add people to a room, not a community. You can invite people with the "Add" button underneath the roster in the right sidebar

[2017-05-31 20:03:55] <ajuhos> MadLittleMods: thanks, but I know I can add users to a room, but still don't know what the "Members of ... can join this room" checkbox is for... how can these members join then? do i have to add every single member of the org to every single room manually?
[2017-05-31 21:12:02] <MadLittleMods> ajuhos: If you give them a link, they should be able to join. You could give them the community home, i.e. [<-LINK->]

[2017-06-01 06:39:48] <meetmangukiya> been trying for almost 10-15 days now
[2017-06-01 11:57:46] <hntd187> On the mobile app how can I remove 1:1 conversations? I also have 1:1 conversations pop up and stay on my home in which neither person has said anything. How can I remove these?
[2017-06-01 11:58:25] <hntd187> It's very annoying to have to sift through all these user conversations and not just close them
[2017-06-01 12:09:32] <laurin1> I just opened this issue, [<-ISSUE->] , and the realized maybe I should have come asked here first. Are push notifications on iOS supposed to be working? They have never worked for me, not even intermittently.
[2017-06-01 13:16:27] <msavichtweet_twitter> Hey guys the Gitter mac app is forcing my Mac to use the discrete graphics card, cutting my battery in half.
[2017-06-01 14:10:46] <michaelsavich> Alright, I figured it out. The issue has been fixed, but isn't in the currently shipping build.
[2017-06-01 14:12:01] <michaelsavich> Still, is there no way to put this change in a 1.178 release?  This is a pretty major issue, especially on the new MacBook Pros
[2017-06-01 14:50:43] <mydigitalself> bhaugen: was it a private room or only for org members? in which case i think removing gitter from your authorised apps would have resulted in a 404 from GitHub and hence kicked you out of the room because you're effectively denied access by github
[2017-06-01 15:35:17] <bhaugen> mydigitalself: it was not public. I just looked for the room settings and am not sure how to answer your other questions. As far as I know, we did not remove gitter from authorizations. Here's what I see now:Approved —Gitter Private Repo Access …Approved —Gitter Public Repo Access …
[2017-06-01 15:35:51] <bhaugen> And only some people lost their memberships, not everybody.
[2017-06-01 15:50:25] <bhaugen> However, room permissions say anybody in the group can do pretty much anything:valueflows Room PermissionsAdminsAdmins can delete the room, edit permissions, ban people, and edit room info like the welcome message and topic.
[2017-06-01 15:51:43] <bhaugen> That's any member of the group in github.
[2017-06-01 15:54:01] <bhaugen> And any member of the group could also have changed the authorized apps in github. I changed them after I thought the room had disappeared, following your instructions, so maybe they had been changed and I changed them back.
[2017-06-01 15:54:25] <bhaugen> But I don't know how that would account for only some people losing their memberships in the gitter room...
[2017-06-01 18:24:28] <christoph2806> Where's the right place to ask questions on the iOS app?
[2017-06-01 18:42:34] <InternetUnexplorer> Here is fine,@christoph2806.
[2017-06-01 18:44:02] <christoph2806> How can I change the sequence of channels in the home view? I'd like to have my beloved channels at the top of the list
[2017-06-01 18:45:49] <InternetUnexplorer> If it works anything like the Android app (most recent first), I don't think you can :(.
[2017-06-01 18:46:51] <christoph2806> Donald trump would say "sad!"
[2017-06-01 23:27:09] <christoph2806> I found it. You can drag and drop the channels in the web application, and this is reflected in the app
[2017-06-01 23:27:16] <christoph2806> 
[2017-06-02 04:35:32] <meetmangukiya> I am not able to create rooms for coala organization
[2017-06-02 04:35:34] <meetmangukiya> Please help
[2017-06-02 04:35:52] <meetmangukiya> I've been trying for more than a week now
[2017-06-02 12:59:52] <davidmogar> Hi there. I'm trying to create a community for my project (cucco) but it says the url (gitter.im/cucco) is taken. The thing is that when I try to access that url, doesn't exists. Search for it here doesn't help either
[2017-06-02 13:39:18] <tooomm> just got this "read this before joining" popup while joining the room - can you configure this for any room? :)
[2017-06-02 14:00:08] <InternetUnexplorer> tooomm: Yep!
[2017-06-02 14:31:32] <tooomm> InternetUnexplorer: pretty sweet, thanks! :)
[2017-06-02 14:38:15] <tooomm> another thing... i created a community on error. how can i delete it? i can just leave or hide it from my list
[2017-06-02 14:47:54] <InternetUnexplorer> You can delete a room from the same menu. At the moment, it isn't possible to delete a community yourself, you need to contact Gitter staff.
[2017-06-02 14:48:34] <InternetUnexplorer> You can do that here, just say which community you would like deleted and they will see your request.
[2017-06-02 15:45:03] <tooomm> do i have to poke somebody? or private chat somebody? i don't know who is from the team...
[2017-06-02 15:46:22] <InternetUnexplorer> Posting here should be enough; they will see it and respond as soon as they can.
[2017-06-02 15:52:09] <tooomm> ok, so there we go: [<-CODE->] 
[2017-06-03 20:20:07] <InternetUnexplorer> thansen97: This room is for Gitter support only. Please check that you are in the correct room before posting next time.
[2017-06-04 04:17:57] <FeliciousX_twitter> unsure if it's asked before, but is it possible to unify my gitter account here?
[2017-06-04 04:18:08] <FeliciousX_twitter> i signed in with twitter and github.. little did i know it would be separate
[2017-06-04 04:18:31] <FeliciousX_twitter> i thought the email would be the unique identifier
[2017-06-04 09:23:30] <Lawanu> Lawanu: Help Please!! i created two rectangle in a CANVAS.Suppose rectangle1 and rectangle2.Now rectangle 1 is below the rectangle 2.What shall i do so,that rectangle 1 comes above rectangle 2 when i click one rectangle 1.I am using JavaScript. [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-04 11:49:11] <grahamperrin> Lawanu: this room is for help with Gitter, not JavaScript.

[2017-06-04 16:49:34] <FeliciousX_twitter> nobody answered my question about gitter :/
[2017-06-05 03:56:59] <awb715> what are some of the coolest things built on top of gitters api?
[2017-06-05 09:59:18] <lyddream> can I use   this library to create ETH Raw Transaction and broadcast it using rpc sendRawTransaction<dependency><groupId>org.ethereum</groupId><artifactId>ethereumj-core</artifactId><version>1.5.0-RELEASE</version></dependency>
[2017-06-05 10:23:31] <grahamperrin> lyddream: wrong room. Please see above, orientation for newcomers.
[2017-06-05 11:37:19] <tooomm> is it possiblr to transfer/change a community? let's say somebody changed his personal repo into an organisational one because it grow by a lot. but the channel here still has his old community name (with his personal user name) which is confusing. just creating a new one would get rid of all history and users in the channel
[2017-06-05 15:15:52] <mydigitalself> tooomm: you can just delete all of the rooms in the community, so it's effectively blank
[2017-06-05 15:16:36] <mydigitalself> meetmangukiya: what issues are you having? that community already exists [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-05 15:17:00] <meetmangukiya> mydigitalself: am not able to create any new rooms
[2017-06-05 15:17:21] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @FeliciousX_twitterIt isn't possibly to merge your accounts. But you can delete the other one, [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-05 15:17:35] <meetmangukiya> After clicking the create button, nothing happens
[2017-06-05 15:18:45] <mydigitalself> meetmangukiya: do you see any javascript errors in your console, could you perhaps send a screenshot of what you are doing with the js console open after clicking create
[2017-06-05 15:19:07] <mydigitalself> i assume you are a member of thecoalaorg?
[2017-06-05 15:19:41] <meetmangukiya> yes
[2017-06-05 15:21:01] <mydigitalself> would also be curious to see what Gitter apps you have here: https://github.com/settings/applications [<-CODE->] 
[2017-06-05 15:22:11] <meetmangukiya>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-05 15:22:18] <meetmangukiya> yes, it shows the org has granted the access
[2017-06-05 15:23:24] <mydigitalself> do you just have one gitter app there (Gitter PUBLIC repo) ?
[2017-06-05 15:23:51] <meetmangukiya> also, gitter webhooks
[2017-06-05 15:24:21] <mydigitalself> can you show me a screenshot of the create room flow you are going through?
[2017-06-05 15:25:02] <mydigitalself> and you don't have Gitter PRIVATE repo ?
[2017-06-05 15:25:07] <meetmangukiya> no
[2017-06-05 15:25:18] <meetmangukiya> I don't have gitter private repo
[2017-06-05 15:25:20] <mydigitalself> ok that's all fine then, so that's not the issue
[2017-06-05 15:25:37] <meetmangukiya> I am clicking add a room button on the left sidebar
[2017-06-05 15:25:39] <MadLittleMods> meetmangukiya: The admins of thecoalacommunity are manual and you are not one of them
[2017-06-05 15:25:57] <mydigitalself> oh, someone changed the permission to not be linked to GitHub org?@MadLittleMods
[2017-06-05 15:26:02] <meetmangukiya> I've created rooms of coala earlier
[2017-06-05 15:26:08] <MadLittleMods> mydigitalself: Yes
[2017-06-05 15:26:12] <meetmangukiya> it worked then :/
[2017-06-05 15:26:27] <meetmangukiya> I've created coala/errbot room fwiw
[2017-06-05 15:26:53] <mydigitalself> sounds like someone has since changed the permissions on the gitter community to have a manual list of people rather than inheriting them from GitHub
[2017-06-05 15:27:04] <mydigitalself> so you will need someone to add you to that list
[2017-06-05 15:27:26] <mydigitalself> i'm surprisedCoalais even showing as an option in theCommunitydropdown on the create room screen then
[2017-06-05 15:27:26] <meetmangukiya> it doesn't have to do with github owners ?
[2017-06-05 15:27:35] <meetmangukiya> yes, it does
[2017-06-05 15:27:58] <mydigitalself> it's possible to change permissions for a community and basically break the link with GitHub's permissions, and someone must have done that
[2017-06-05 15:28:59] <meetmangukiya> so who might have the permissions?
[2017-06-05 15:29:12] <meetmangukiya> even the org owner@jayvdbisn't able to create a room
[2017-06-05 15:29:59] <meetmangukiya> and I am one of the admins at one of the rooms as well..
[2017-06-05 15:30:06] <meetmangukiya> I even have write access to coala repos
[2017-06-05 15:30:13] <MadLittleMods> meetmangukiya: SanketDG,NiklasMM
[2017-06-05 15:30:15] <meetmangukiya> though am not the owner
[2017-06-05 15:30:24] <meetmangukiya> just the two of them?
[2017-06-05 15:30:27] <meetmangukiya> that's strange
[2017-06-05 15:30:38] <meetmangukiya> can we set this back to normal?
[2017-06-05 15:31:09] <MadLittleMods> Might be best to figure out why one of them changed it to manual
[2017-06-05 15:31:11] <mydigitalself> probably best to ask one of them why they did that first
[2017-06-05 15:31:13] <meetmangukiya> where everyone with write access to coala can create rooms and manage integrations and stuff for all rooms of coala community?
[2017-06-05 15:31:56] <meetmangukiya> I am pretty sure it was a mistake, though I'll ask 
[2017-06-05 15:32:16] <MadLittleMods> Everyone with org access will be a community admin
[2017-06-05 15:32:18] <meetmangukiya> butwherewaswhatchanged to manually?
[2017-06-05 15:32:55] <mydigitalself> meetmangukiya: under the options icon, you can click onPermissions
[2017-06-05 15:32:58] <mydigitalself> and get to something like this
[2017-06-05 15:33:09] <meetmangukiya> so we might know how to revert it.. isn't that just for one room?
[2017-06-05 15:33:09] <mydigitalself>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-05 15:33:28] <meetmangukiya> because I do see permissions in one of the rooms
[2017-06-05 15:33:29] <mydigitalself> the Permissions is for the room, at the bottom of the permissions modal there's a link to go to the whole community permission
[2017-06-05 15:33:32] <meetmangukiya> and not in the other
[2017-06-05 15:33:42] <mydigitalself> yeah, you must have been manually added as an admin of that particular room
[2017-06-05 15:34:06] <mydigitalself> this is the one for a room
[2017-06-05 15:34:15] <mydigitalself>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-05 15:34:27] <mydigitalself> and then for those who are admins of the whole community, you have that link at the bottom left
[2017-06-05 15:35:36] <meetmangukiya>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-05 15:35:43] <meetmangukiya> I see both of them :/
[2017-06-05 15:35:44] <meetmangukiya>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-05 15:36:00] <meetmangukiya> then I am the admin and Ishouldbe able to create rooms
[2017-06-05 15:36:00] <meetmangukiya> ?
[2017-06-05 15:36:21] <meetmangukiya>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-05 15:36:27] <meetmangukiya> sorry, one was sent twice 
[2017-06-05 15:36:46] <meetmangukiya> however, there is nothing in that drop down
[2017-06-05 15:37:37] <meetmangukiya> and I am not sure why am getting that exclamation
[2017-06-05 15:37:54] <mydigitalself> yeah it looks like a bug that you are seeing both thecoalaroom in the list and you have the ability to view that second modal, which is why you are seeing some weird stuff on it.
[2017-06-05 15:38:10] <mydigitalself> because it can't read the settings as you aren't an admin
[2017-06-05 15:38:43] <mydigitalself> best to ping the SanketDG & NiklasMM and ask them if they intentionally did this
[2017-06-05 15:39:49] <MadLittleMods> You won't be able to switch back to GitHub permissions by yourself (see warning in the last screenshot you sent). When you have figured things out, send a message tosupport@gitter.imwith a link to this conversation  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-05 15:40:13] <meetmangukiya> I am even able to add people by username..
[2017-06-05 15:40:46] <meetmangukiya> btw did the console log help?
[2017-06-05 15:41:25] <MadLittleMods> It's a bug in the UI that you are able to see the community in create room dropdown and in the permissions modal. Somehow you have the group listed but don't have permissions
[2017-06-05 15:45:31] <meetmangukiya> alright 
[2017-06-05 15:45:51] <meetmangukiya> from whom would you want an email for that?
[2017-06-05 15:46:13] <meetmangukiya> would me emailing that work@MadLittleMods?
[2017-06-05 15:47:13] <MadLittleMods> From @meetmangukiya would work ;) https://github.com/orgs/coala/people?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=meetmangukiyaInclude a permalink to this conversation that I mentioned earlier. Would be nice to hear why it was changed in case I can better setup the community permissions
[2017-06-05 15:47:58] <meetmangukiya> I think it is better to see at the team I am part of
[2017-06-05 15:48:09] <meetmangukiya> since we invite everyone to our org
[2017-06-05 15:48:13] <meetmangukiya> just not the right team
[2017-06-05 15:48:23] <meetmangukiya> so, we can assign issues to them
[2017-06-05 15:48:37] <meetmangukiya> however, I guess teams might not be public :P
[2017-06-05 15:48:38] <MadLittleMods> hmmm, using a GitHub based community is probably not best then which is probably why it was changed
[2017-06-05 15:49:19] <meetmangukiya> but it was with write access, so it should've worked
[2017-06-05 15:49:30] <meetmangukiya> since the default team doesn't have write access
[2017-06-05 15:49:53] <meetmangukiya> yeah, it seems that teams are internal, not public 
[2017-06-05 15:51:01] <MadLittleMods> We don't consider teams or write access on the org level.Your community is currently set to manual and not connected to the GitHub org.It should probably stay on manual and just add the other members that should be admin to the community admins (by the 2 existing community admins)
[2017-06-05 16:44:32] <tooomm> @mydigitalself@tooomm you can just delete all of the rooms in the community, so it's effectively blankthat sounds like a bad workaround... and will NOT remove the community from the create a room window
[2017-06-05 22:48:20] <jimtryon> We are having a big problem with Gitter and was looking for some advice… in the FreeCodeCamp chat room, a lot of us are having to refresh every 1-2 hours because the app will just crash or hang and it doesn’t seem to be able to support the load (100 new people every day) it seems
[2017-06-06 05:42:36] <narutopden> How to link out out of python to my terminal and im using atom ?
[2017-06-06 06:01:41] <grahamperrin> narutopden: wrong room
[2017-06-06 07:06:52] <narutopden> grahamperrin: can u please tell me where should i have to go ???
[2017-06-06 13:59:34] <InternetUnexplorer> narutopden: The correct room is gitterHQ/developers.
[2017-06-06 14:41:42] <davidmogar> Hi. Maybe you can help. I have a gitter room with url [<-LINK->] . That community that I don't remember creating it has two rooms and no I want to add a new one for another project. The thing is that when I click in Add a new room it ask me to create a community and when I put davidmogar it says that already exists. What can I do?
[2017-06-06 15:42:26] <rbrlortie> Hi! We are looking for a chat for our community. Does Gitter allow embed? Is there a way to embed the chat right into a website?
[2017-06-06 16:46:48] <MadLittleMods>  June 5, 2017 5:48 PM @jimtryon Is this the desktop or mobile app? (which OS)I use the browser version all the time
[2017-06-06 16:49:19] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @davidmogarSee [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-06 16:49:51] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @rbrlortieSee [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-06 16:50:22] <rbrlortie> Now that's awesome!
[2017-06-06 16:50:46] <rbrlortie> And it's possible to have a channel without having a git to link it to, right?
[2017-06-06 16:51:06] <MadLittleMods> rbrlortie: Correct, you can have room associated with nothing
[2017-06-06 16:51:37] <rbrlortie> Is it possible to have sidecar embedded directly in a page and not in a tab?
[2017-06-06 16:51:51] <MadLittleMods> rbrlortie: Yes, see the options given on that page
[2017-06-06 16:52:53] <rbrlortie> I'm looking at Gitter's pricing and "LIMITED TO 25 USERS PER PRIVATE ROOM", what defines a private room? Is the room we are in right now considered private?
[2017-06-06 16:53:11] <MadLittleMods> rbrlortie: Everything is free nowadays with no limits. Where are you seeing that?
[2017-06-06 16:53:19] <rbrlortie>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-06 16:53:39] <MadLittleMods> How did you get there? (wondering about the user flow)
[2017-06-06 16:55:11] <rbrlortie>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-06 16:55:58] <MadLittleMods>  Thanks @rbrlortieIf you have some further questions about Sidecar, we have a specific room for it, https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/sidecar
[2017-06-06 16:56:34] <rbrlortie> Once I create a community, users can create as many rooms as they want in it, right?
[2017-06-06 16:57:07] <MadLittleMods> rbrlortie: If they are admins of the community, yes
[2017-06-06 16:58:01] <rbrlortie> Is it possible to allows regular users to create them? We have a community where users can create robotics projects and we would love if the users were able to create their own chatrooms for their projects
[2017-06-06 16:58:31] <MadLittleMods> rbrlortie: no. You could setup the community based on a GitHub org and anyone in the org could be an admin
[2017-06-06 16:58:58] <rbrlortie> Alright, thanks!
[2017-06-06 17:05:56] <rbrlortie> Is it possible to change the chat's URL? Could I have [<-LINK->] or char.mysite.com and have the chat right there? Or can I only do redirects?
[2017-06-06 18:57:06] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @rbrlortieWe don't setup sub-domains on thegitter.imdomain for rooms but you can do whatever you want on your own site
[2017-06-06 18:58:12] <rbrlortie> MadLittleMods: Can I host gitter? Or do people simply embed gitter.im chat rooms into their sites?
[2017-06-06 18:58:52] <MadLittleMods> rbrlortie: We don't provide a self hosted solution, [<-ISSUE->] - just embed
[2017-06-06 19:00:27] <rbrlortie> Alright! Do you guys provide an easy way to embed like sidecar but fullscreen? Or should I use sidecar and and tweaks the options to make it fullscreen?
[2017-06-06 19:00:52] <MadLittleMods> rbrlortie: Tweak Sidecar. Embed in your own container and add some CSS
[2017-06-06 19:01:14] <rbrlortie> Alright! Thanks!
[2017-06-06 19:01:54] <rbrlortie> I think I have enough information to stop this Slack implementation from happening 
[2017-06-06 19:21:40] <SDRausty> 
[2017-06-06 21:15:02] <ElenaSalaks> Are there any examples of past live virtual events that have used Gitter Sidecar for a live Q&A session with the audience? How was the moderator identified?
[2017-06-06 22:04:43] <grahamperrin> sdrausty: this room is for Gitter support.
[2017-06-06 22:07:22] <SDRausty> grahamperrin: gotcha thanks
[2017-06-07 02:25:42] <johnaddme> What happened! Surprise!
[2017-06-07 02:26:17] <InternetUnexplorer> johnaddme: ?
[2017-06-07 02:33:44] <SDRausty> grahamperrin: yep found this out quickly. Thanks.
[2017-06-07 03:34:51] <jimtryon> MadLittleMods: It’s the desktop version. I switched from using the browser version so I didn’t have too many tabs open in Chrome.
[2017-06-07 03:37:09] <jimtryon> There also doesn’t seem to be too much of a difference in browser and desktop versions when it comes to having to refresh the app because it freezes or it can’t handle the load of users in a group.
[2017-06-07 03:59:03] <N0LIFEE> Hi is this is coders programmers chat channel?
[2017-06-07 03:59:17] <N0LIFEE> *programmers
[2017-06-07 08:16:58] <cbeams> It appears that Gitter does not support issuing notifications onactivityin a given room, e.g. when stuff happens in the right-hand column, such as new commits or CI build breakages. Is this correct, or have I missed something?
[2017-06-07 08:19:14] <jimtryon> You should get notifications in a given room. It’s working on my end@cbeams
[2017-06-07 08:21:45] <cbeams> Thanks,@jimtryon. So, for example, in this room, the latest item in the activity stream isdusty-nv opened #1726. You're saying that you recieve notifications for items like this in the same fashion that message notifications are issued?
[2017-06-07 08:24:00] <jimtryon> No, I think that is on a room basis. I don’t receive any notifications like the notification in this room.
[2017-06-07 14:00:12] <mydigitalself> cbeams: no there are no notifications for activity
[2017-06-07 14:01:39] <InternetUnexplorer> N0LIFEE: No, that is gitterHQ/developers. Assuming you are not on mobile, relevant information is in the message you got when joining the room.
[2017-06-07 14:10:33] <cbeams> Thanks, @mydigitalself. I wonder if this is something intentonally not supported—and therefore not likely to be added in the future—or simply not supported yet.My use case is that I'd like to be able to use Gitter for my open source projects in much the same way I've used Slack for closed source projects. When, say, a CI build fails, I want to get a notification and see a badge number count increase in the corresponding room, so I know there's something that needs my attention. If I do not have this, then I have to fall back to keeping my mail client open (so that I get the email from Travis CI), or fall back to using a second notification system, e.g. Slack.
[2017-06-07 15:04:48] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @cbeamsCorrect, you can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-06-07 21:01:56] <awb715> what are some of the coolest features that have been developed on gitter?
[2017-06-07 21:02:29] <awb715> I'm planing on building a community using gitter
[2017-06-07 21:05:04] <Abell715_twitter> hello
[2017-06-07 21:06:48] <Abell715_twitter> I'm experimenting using gitter as a twitter login. How do I update my profile on here
[2017-06-07 21:07:28] <MadLittleMods> Abell715_twitter: There isn't a way to update your Gitter profile. Everything is inherited from what you signed in with
[2017-06-07 21:08:18] <Abell715_twitter> So this account is using twitter, why didnt my twitter profile show up
[2017-06-07 21:08:28] <Abell715_twitter> my twitter avi, bio
[2017-06-07 21:09:07] <MadLittleMods> Abell715_twitter: Your avatar looks correct to me, [<-LINK->] - We don't show GitHub/Twitter bios
[2017-06-07 21:10:01] <Abell715_twitter> Well with my account using github my website link is available
[2017-06-07 21:10:26] <Abell715_twitter> when you click the avatar image, I dont see any info from twitter, or my avi. Maybe its just my comp
[2017-06-07 21:11:02] <MadLittleMods> Abell715_twitter: Looks like we don't pull Twitter info like the website field for Twitter users yet
[2017-06-07 21:11:59] <Abell715_twitter> hmm i see!
[2017-06-07 21:12:30] <Abell715_twitter> any plans to incorporate email login in the future? I want to build a community on top of gitter but my core users probably will only have twitter accounts
[2017-06-07 21:16:03] <rbrlortie> Waaaait, there's no email signup? Aww, I thought I had the perfect solution with Gitter. Back to googling chat clients for communities.
[2017-06-07 21:20:04] <awb715> rbrlortie: let me know what you come across
[2017-06-07 21:20:09] <awb715> now back on my github account haha
[2017-06-07 21:22:28] <MadLittleMods> rbrlortie: @awb715You can track [<-ISSUE->] for other authorizations that get added
[2017-06-07 21:22:45] <MadLittleMods> Next up is GitLab sign in, [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-06-07 21:28:08] <awb715> thanks@MadLittleMods
[2017-06-07 21:54:53] <awb715> what are some cool gitter bots?
[2017-06-07 23:49:29] <jgeorgeson> i'm using the windows desktop app, the the notification are icon continues indicating there's unread messages even though none of the rooms in myAll Conversationsshow any unread messages
[2017-06-08 07:03:16] <jimtryon> I’m not sure this question was answered yet but how do I fix the performance issues with both the desktop and browser-based versions of Gitter? Due to the huge load of users that we have, I have to refresh every 2 hours and if I leave and come back, the app freezes from the amount of messages.
[2017-06-08 12:45:32] <TeamJakic_twitter> hey, my first time in gitter. is there any way I can change how my username appears?
[2017-06-08 13:18:29] <Ekansh97> What can be a  better way to implement "imfill" function (used matlab) in a python script? any ideas?
[2017-06-08 13:24:51] <Aldian-fr> Hi, I would like to set gitter language to french in my personnal UI and also as the default of my community. How do I do that?
[2017-06-08 14:03:30] <InternetUnexplorer> Ekansh97: @floriodavidd_twitterWrong room. This room is for Gitter support only.
[2017-06-08 14:14:46] <talon-vonneudeck> Hello everyone. Is [<-LINK->] the actual github organisation of GitterHG?
[2017-06-08 14:24:57] <cbj4074> talon-vonneudeck: Not sure what GitterHG is, but yes, that's the official org page for GitterHQ.
[2017-06-08 14:42:00] <begriffs> Hi, is there a way to increase the font size on the standalone Gitter app?
[2017-06-08 14:42:42] <begriffs> Unlike in Chrome,Cmd - +has no effect.
[2017-06-08 14:56:15] <talon-vonneudeck> Thank you.@cbj4074
[2017-06-08 14:58:20] <cbj4074> talon-vonneudeck: No prob!

[2017-06-09 01:48:01] <mstellaluna> Hello. I have a very specific question I don't know if someone can help with or not. Is there a way to get the gitter archives for a community in a specific file format like JSON so I can use that data to filter through complaints and create a UX Customer Journey Map?
[2017-06-09 01:48:52] <InternetUnexplorer> mstellaluna: Perhaps some of the resources at [<-LINK->] can help? (assuming you haven't already looked there).
[2017-06-09 01:49:22] <mstellaluna> InternetUnexplorer: uhmm no I haven't but i'll ask there. Thanks a lot :)

[2017-06-09 17:15:53] <grahamperrin> MadLittleMods: please, does [<-ISSUE->] affect the desktop application on multiple applications? (I assume so.) Or just Windows?
[2017-06-09 18:13:33] <MadLittleMods> grahamperrin: Not sure what you mean. The NW.js apps runs on any platform but we don't distribute it on macOS
[2017-06-09 18:16:28] <grahamperrin> thanks
[2017-06-10 06:52:08] <jimtryon> How do I block a user on gitter?
[2017-06-10 06:58:48] <N8Solutions> @/developersI'm on my phone using the Gitter App. I'm trying to login to Gitter on my desktop using Github & instead of being logged in I'm receiving a 404 error message from Github.
[2017-06-10 07:05:47] <grahamperrin> jimtryon:  [<-LINK->] please subscribe to [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-06-10 07:06:36] <grahamperrin> N8Solutions: which OS?
[2017-06-10 07:06:56] <N8Solutions> Windows on Firefox.
[2017-06-10 07:07:27] <grahamperrin> grahamperrin: boots Windows 7 in VirtualBox
[2017-06-10 07:07:46] <N8Solutions> It's a 404 error so would it matter what OS?
[2017-06-10 07:09:05] <jimtryon> grahamperrin: Ban doesn’t seem to do anything for me
[2017-06-10 07:10:17] <N8Solutions> Just tried on Google Chrome and it works. Firefox seems to be the issue.
[2017-06-10 07:11:31] <N8Solutions> For clarification I'm using Windows 10 with FF v.53.0.3 (64-bit)
[2017-06-10 07:11:44] <grahamperrin> N8Solutions: I have a Mac to one side but it's currently devoted to testing Core Storage. Easier for me to boot Windows … OK, when you said Gitter App at first I thought you meant the OS-specific application.
[2017-06-10 07:12:11] <N8Solutions> Sorry, the iOS app
[2017-06-10 07:18:23] <N8Solutions> Windows Edge, IE, & Chrome work just fine. Clearing FF cache doesn't do the trick. So FF is the only browser I can not use to login to Gitter via Github.
[2017-06-10 07:31:52] <grahamperrin> Works for me with Firefox ESR 31.2.0 on Windows 7, I'll retry with Portable Edition.
[2017-06-10 07:32:59] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-10 07:42:03] <grahamperrin> N8Solutions: the gist linked from [<-LINK->] might be a workaround, equally I'd like to troubleshoot the symptom in your case.
[2017-06-10 07:46:33] <N8Solutions> Ok, what do you need from me?
[2017-06-10 07:49:32] <grahamperrin> If you like, create a new user account in Windows; to tell whether the issue is reproducible with a clean profile.
[2017-06-10 07:50:15] <grahamperrin> Tested: GitHub-based auth with the latest release of Firefox on pre-release Mac OS X 10.13.
[2017-06-10 07:54:45] <N8Solutions> OK, give me a moment to test that out.
[2017-06-10 07:57:40] <N8Solutions> OK, I just created a new account and it did the same thing
[2017-06-10 07:58:31] <N8Solutions> If I am logged out of Github it prompts me to login or create a new account but after logging in to Github I get the 404 error.
[2017-06-10 08:00:41] <N8Solutions> By the way, this issue just started today. Yesterday I was logging in to Gitter via Github in FF normally.
[2017-06-10 08:00:46] <N8Solutions> grahamperrin: 
[2017-06-10 08:04:37] <grahamperrin> What's the URL when you get the 404?
[2017-06-10 08:06:12] <N8Solutions> grahamperrin:  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-10 08:19:21] <grahamperrin> OK. I can't offer an explanation but I'll continue to try to reproduce the issue.
[2017-06-10 09:46:36] <grahamperrin> Not reproducible for GitHub usergrahamperrinwith Firefox Portable Edition 53.0.3 (32-bit) on 32-bit Windows 7 Enterprise:
[2017-06-10 09:47:20] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-10 09:51:47] <grahamperrin> N8Solutions: maybe check that GitHub authorisation works for a different service e.g. login at [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-10 09:51:53] <jimtryon> grahamperrin: I need to have a way to block users on Gitter.
[2017-06-10 09:52:31] <grahamperrin> N8Solutions: then [<-LINK->] if you wish to revoke anything.
[2017-06-10 09:53:05] <grahamperrin> jimtryon: I can't help, sorry; I'm not a developer.
[2017-06-10 10:28:43] <grahamperrin> akodia488: no need to shout (UPPERCASE) and please note that this room is for help with Gitter, not for help with torrents. At [<-LINK->] you might find a more appropriate room; the rhubarb room, maybe.
[2017-06-10 11:34:23] <N8Solutions> grahamperrin: I figured it out. I went in to FF options and selectively deleted all Cookies for Gitter and Github. Afterwards I was able to log back in successfully. Thank you for your help in troubleshooting earlier!
[2017-06-10 12:26:52] <grahamperrin> N8Solutions: thanks, I'm glad that you worked around the issue, but it's strange that you previously [<-LINK->] . With a new account, I would expect no cookies.
[2017-06-10 12:27:41] <N8Solutions> you'll get no arguments from me
[2017-06-10 13:44:59] <SuperDle> hello world

[2017-06-10 13:50:38] <grahamperrin> OK, this room is only for help with Gitter. If you'd like to chat about other things, or test, try another room: [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-10 13:51:25] <SuperDle> i see
[2017-06-10 15:02:34] <TheDiamondYT1> I really wish you'd open source the Gitter Android app, so we can make contributions (-_-)
[2017-06-10 15:47:53] <InternetUnexplorer> TheDiamondYT1: I'm assuming it will be released with the rest of the Gitter source later this year.
[2017-06-10 17:50:06] <TheMarco77> (Sup Brains Of the future).... Question? When is the right time to start populating code in your GitHub account for a newbie?
[2017-06-10 19:05:48] <mertyildiran> Hi, I would like be notified via<title>through my browser tab when someone tagged my username. Just like the feature in freenode IRC. Could you add such a feature to Gitter? Thx!
[2017-06-10 19:07:55] <grahamperrin> TheMarco77:  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-10 19:10:36] <grahamperrin> mertyildiran: please see [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-06-10 19:13:04] <mertyildiran> grahamperrin: oh great! I read that GitLab will open-source Gitter's source code [<-LINK->] . Is it true? If so I would like to contribute to Gitter, it's a solid project.
[2017-06-10 19:15:00] <grahamperrin> True: [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-10 19:21:09] <mertyildiran> grahamperrin: please tag me (or all) when it become open-source. Cheers!
[2017-06-10 19:36:14] <grahamperrin> I expect there'll be an announcement in this room, and a blog post, but not from me (I'm not a developer).
[2017-06-10 19:42:54] <mertyildiran> grahamperrin: oh OK.
[2017-06-10 20:17:36] <scunningham09> How do you delete or remove people listed under people?
[2017-06-10 20:18:51] <scunningham09> Clarification** things listed under all conversations?
[2017-06-10 21:00:44] <TheDiamondYT1> What! Giitter is becoming completely open-source!?
[2017-06-10 21:44:15] <InternetUnexplorer> scunningham09: If you click on their name, there should be a red "remove" button which will remove them from the room.
[2017-06-10 21:45:11] <InternetUnexplorer> TheMarco77: Wrong room, you might want to ask in gitterHQ/developers instead. This room is for Gitter support only.
[2017-06-10 23:28:24] <PFCKrutonium_twitter> Hey, is there anyone here that could help me out? I can't login via GitHub because GitHub keeps returning a 404.

[2017-06-11 16:31:29] <akshaysharma57> hi
[2017-06-11 16:54:45] <InternetUnexplorer> akshaydotfi: Hello, what is your Gitter support question?
[2017-06-11 20:55:12] <grahamperrin> PFCKrutonium_twitter: see [<-LINK->] and the preceding conversation. If the problem persists, please raise the issue at [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-12 01:40:41] <InternetUnexplorer> It's not a chat about general software development or general technical support. It's to discuss Gitter itself - the chat application you are using right now.hmmm
[2017-06-12 01:40:44] <InternetUnexplorer> Tidwell007: 
[2017-06-12 01:41:33] <InternetUnexplorer> (you're in the wrong room)
[2017-06-12 01:41:42] <Tidwell007> oh ok well i appreciate it anyways...on to oanother site
[2017-06-12 01:41:45] <Tidwell007> thanks anyways
[2017-06-12 01:41:47] <InternetUnexplorer> np
[2017-06-12 12:20:22] <tooomm> my "transfer/change community question" stands  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-12 12:21:07] <tooomm> as well as the deleteMagic-Tokencommunity request :)
[2017-06-13 00:16:08] <MadLittleMods> Sorry@tooomm, send a request tosupport@gitter.im, [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-13 05:11:23] <grahamperrin> PFCKrutonium_twitter: @PFCKrutoniumre: [<-LINK->] did you work around your GitHub authentication issue and if so, would you like to delete your unlisted video?
[2017-06-13 05:14:41] <Krutonium> Ah Yes, That worked, Thanks!
[2017-06-13 05:15:03] <Krutonium> Also, good guess on my Username (I think)
[2017-06-13 05:15:53] <grahamperrin> Off-topic from Gitter: I recently worked around aGitHubTwitter authentication issue affecting Diaspora – [<-LINK->] – by avoiding browser extensions. Firefox in my case.
[2017-06-13 05:21:52] <grahamperrin> A common factor: OAuth (I guess).
[2017-06-13 05:24:01] <Krutonium> I have to wonder why a presumably bad cookie would cause oauth to 404
[2017-06-13 05:27:13] <grahamperrin> I lack the technical knowledge, but I'm curious.@PFCKrutoniumcan you recall, did you delete cookies for both GitHubandGitter? In retrospect, I wonder whether attention to just one of the two sets might have worked around.
[2017-06-13 05:29:42] <Krutonium> I deleted my cookies from Gitter and it didn't fix it, deleted cookies from Github and it did
[2017-06-13 05:37:21] <Krutonium> I think, anyway
[2017-06-13 05:45:35] <grahamperrin> OK – thanks again.
[2017-06-13 08:43:16] <tooomm> MadLittleMods: thanks for coming back to me! I send the mail 
[2017-06-13 10:58:43] <ochrons> MadLittleMods: hey, I'd like to add Gitter chat integration to ScalaFiddle, so that fiddle links would expand like Github gists do. ScalaFiddle is already supported on Iframely, so it should be quite easy to do? See [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-13 12:44:00] <pawni> hi guys, I wanted to create a channel for a new repo in an organisation yesterday and apparently did everything wrong by first creating the org channel and then not knowing what to do and deleting the channel again. now the channel name seems to be still reserved for the old channel - is there any way to solve this? also what's the normal procedure to have org/repo channels but not the org channel?
[2017-06-14 04:27:04] <ba2015sheer_twitter> Hello
[2017-06-14 04:28:32] <grahamperrin> ba2015sheer_twitter: hello, what is your Gitter support question?
[2017-06-14 06:13:29] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @pawniI assume you mean communities (in Gitter terms). Those communities still exist as you can't delete a community. Click the "Add a room" button at the bottom of the conversation list to see it listed in the community dropdown. Can you give some more specific URLs?
[2017-06-14 06:18:32] <pawni> MadLittleMods: ah cool! I just want to get a room for [<-LINK->] ^^ apparently I can create a room for the community but not with the same name as the repo ?
[2017-06-14 06:21:34] <MadLittleMods> pawni: Do you have GitHub private repo access granted on either the org or yourself? You probably also need to add it to the other one as well
[2017-06-14 06:27:05] <pawni> that was it! thanks :) it had public repo access already and I thought that's enough for public repos
[2017-06-14 06:27:40] <MadLittleMods> pawni: If you have private repo access, we prioritize that token which doesn't have access to the org
[2017-06-14 06:40:58] <pawni> good to know - thanks
[2017-06-14 08:20:34] <webskydavid> Hi, have some problem to start gitter on windows 7. The app is still on taskbar and don't want to open fullsize. Is there a solution for this problem ?
[2017-06-14 11:49:37] <TheCodingMeatball> Does anybody know if there are any coding conventions happening in london this week?
[2017-06-14 12:18:02] <sarangc> hello everybody
[2017-06-14 12:43:35] <Ellyria> If I have too many conversations sitting over on the left and I chooseHidefrom the menu on some of them, what will happen if one of the people writes to me? Will the conversation reappear or will there be some other step I must take to reactivate it?
[2017-06-14 12:47:53] <Ellyria> Sorry for the noise. I found the answer. The conversation will reopen if they type to me again.
[2017-06-14 13:49:04] <labyed> hi everyone, i don't know how to use  the markdown for the formated code, can anyone help me
[2017-06-14 13:50:03] <Ellyria> Do you see the little button with an M and a down arrow to the right of where you type in this chat room,@labyed? It opens a Markdown cheat sheet.
[2017-06-14 13:51:28] <rbrlortie> ```
[2017-06-14 13:51:32] <rbrlortie> code
[2017-06-14 13:51:45] <rbrlortie> ```
[2017-06-14 13:53:32] <Ellyria> How did you do that? I'm kind of surprised the backticks didn't turn it into code.
[2017-06-14 13:53:56] <labyed>  [<-CODE->] 
[2017-06-14 13:55:07] <labyed> you put tree backticks and press enter
[2017-06-14 13:55:24] <labyed> and you switch the mode
[2017-06-14 14:01:23] <Ellyria> But how did you put the rows of backticks inside it? Shouldn't they have cancelled it out?
[2017-06-14 14:05:15] <rbrlortie> Escaped them with \
[2017-06-14 14:05:35] <rbrlortie> (And escaped that \ with \\)
[2017-06-14 14:06:43] <labyed>  [<-CODE->] ```
[2017-06-14 14:12:10] <Ellyria> Oh, I'm an idiot [kicks self in head].
[2017-06-14 14:22:13] <grahamperrin> TheCodingMeatball: @sarangcthis room is for help with Gitter.
[2017-06-14 14:23:09] <grahamperrin> rbrlortie: @Ellyriafor testing please use the sandbox room.

[2017-06-14 14:23:47] <Ellyria> ...
[2017-06-14 14:27:02] <rbrlortie> grahamperrin: What are you talking about? This person asked for help as to how to format code in Gitter and I answered how. That's the very essence of this channel.
[2017-06-14 14:27:12] <TheCodingMeatball> grahamperrin: I never knew cats could write in English.
[2017-06-14 15:05:55] <grahamperrin> rbrlortie: just drawing attention to the sandbox
[2017-06-14 15:06:27] <rbrlortie> No worries, appreciate your effort to keep things clean
[2017-06-14 15:07:13] <grahamperrin> likewise, your help is appreciated 
[2017-06-14 18:42:43] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @webskydavidClicking on the icon/right-clicking and selecting a room doesn't bring up the window? You can try this [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-14 20:32:00] <cpq> Is it possible to upload images the way Ghost does it, by adding empty![]()then uploading my image?
[2017-06-14 20:32:46] <cpq> Or, what is the best practice to share screenshots/etc ? Using some public image hosting service?
[2017-06-14 20:37:08] <InternetUnexplorer> cpq: You can upload images by dragging them into Gitter, that's one way to do it.
[2017-06-14 20:40:26] <rbrlortie> You can also simply press ctrl+v
[2017-06-14 20:40:29] <rbrlortie>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-14 20:43:03] <InternetUnexplorer> I use ShareX, which takes a screenshot, uploads it to imgur, and then copies the link to my clipboard.
[2017-06-14 20:43:15] <InternetUnexplorer> Whatever works best for you, basically.
[2017-06-14 20:44:24] <rbrlortie> I use the built-in OS screenshot utility and simply paste it in the chat. 
[2017-06-15 07:34:26] <Michael0x2a> Hi -- I'm currently using the Gitter desktop client on Windows 10. Currently, whenever I get a notification about a message in one of the rooms I'm active in (and don't have the gitter window active), Gitter will display both the new message in a little pop-up at the bottom right of my screen and make a little chiming noise.Is there some way to silence the chiming noise? It's a bit too loud and intrusive for my tastes -- I'd like to have only the popup. I poked around in the desktop client settings but wasn't able to find an option related to this.
[2017-06-15 08:57:21] <cpq> rbrlortie: ooh fantastic, thanks very much!

[2017-06-15 14:42:19] <kevinfiol> Is there where Gitter developers meet?
[2017-06-15 14:45:25] <rbrlortie> kevinfiol:  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-15 14:51:09] <kevinfiol> rbrlortie: thanks
[2017-06-15 15:28:23] <Michael0x2a> MadLittleMods: Aha! Thank you!
[2017-06-15 17:31:25] <irlcatgirl> Are there plans to allow us to easily insert images in the future in gitter? Or should we just use solutions like Imgur for now?
[2017-06-15 17:31:59] <MadLittleMods> nsuchy: You can drag and drop images onto the chat area. Thinking of something else?
[2017-06-15 17:32:19] <rbrlortie>  [<-LINK->] @nsuchy
[2017-06-15 17:32:28] <irlcatgirl> There’s not an easy way to insert an image. Like no button to open the file prompt
[2017-06-15 17:32:33] <rbrlortie> Just paste it in
[2017-06-15 17:32:36] <rbrlortie> ctrl+v
[2017-06-15 17:32:51] <irlcatgirl> I currently just upload to my private image host but dragging from a folder into gitter isn’t the best UX
[2017-06-15 17:32:56] <irlcatgirl> It’d be really nice to have a button
[2017-06-15 17:32:57] <rbrlortie>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-15 17:33:42] <irlcatgirl> In Discord there is a button to the left ( [<-LINK->] )
[2017-06-15 17:34:02] <irlcatgirl> the button opens a file prompt, it’s a lot simpler and would be for new gitter users to have
[2017-06-15 17:34:19] <irlcatgirl> rather than going to their file manager, clicking copy and paste, or uploading to imgur then pasting a link
[2017-06-15 18:39:02] <MadLittleMods> nsuchy: You can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-06-15 18:48:31] <irlcatgirl> Thank you
[2017-06-16 05:49:16] <JekoTronik> Hello Gitters !
[2017-06-16 05:49:56] <JekoTronik> When will I be able to sign in with my GitLab account ? cheers
[2017-06-16 10:44:32] <osofem> If I have more than one community, how can I change the logo if any of them?
[2017-06-16 16:10:22] <mydigitalself> JekoTronik: we're busy open sourcing gitter first (in fact, the open source version is running onnextat the moment) and will then do Login with GitLab.
[2017-06-16 16:11:57] <mydigitalself> osofem: just click on the community icon in any of your rooms and you can upload a new one
[2017-06-16 16:12:11] <mydigitalself> in the top part of the app where you see this for example
[2017-06-16 16:12:27] <mydigitalself>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-16 16:48:02] <irlcatgirl> It is normal for Gitter to use 490MB+ of RAM?
[2017-06-16 16:48:10] <irlcatgirl> That matches big browsers
[2017-06-16 16:50:29] <rbrlortie> You mean the desktop app? It's pretty much a standalone browser that can only render one page, so that's normal.
[2017-06-16 16:51:29] <irlcatgirl> yea
[2017-06-16 16:51:31] <irlcatgirl> using the mac app
[2017-06-16 16:51:42] <irlcatgirl> so it’s normal for the heavy RAM use?
[2017-06-16 16:52:14] <irlcatgirl> considered doing an actual app and pulling data from API rather than a frame?
[2017-06-16 16:52:26] <irlcatgirl> I know development takes a lot of time so limited resources might prevent that
[2017-06-16 16:52:31] <irlcatgirl> but it’d be a cool idea to optimize it
[2017-06-16 16:53:42] <rbrlortie> Yep, it's the downside of using modern technologies that allows to rapidly create native applications. It uses the same technology as the browser so you can have a small web team create an app that will work for mac+linux+windows really quickly but then you choose development time over optimizations
[2017-06-16 16:54:20] <irlcatgirl> it would of been a better idea to just package the site into a Chrome app
[2017-06-16 16:54:27] <irlcatgirl> since the app is basically a one page browser
[2017-06-16 16:54:52] <irlcatgirl> I think it could of leeached Chrome’s resource management and would of benefited
[2017-06-16 16:54:56] <irlcatgirl> Thoughts?
[2017-06-16 16:55:45] <rbrlortie> Simply use the website if you don't want a standalone app?
[2017-06-16 17:00:05] <irlcatgirl> apps are nice though
[2017-06-16 17:00:19] <irlcatgirl> i kinda want the best of both worlds

[2017-06-17 01:37:49] <InternetUnexplorer> Is it just me, or does the welcome message keep changing?
[2017-06-17 07:41:07] <grahamperrin> That's by design I think.
[2017-06-17 07:59:51] <jimtryon> Is there a solution for the load problems on Desktop/Browser Gitter? It’s annoying that I have to refresh the channel every 2 hours.
[2017-06-17 20:48:10] <ba2015sheer_twitter> Ok
[2017-06-18 07:14:15] <Dids> Can you clear the activity once you've removed all integrations?
[2017-06-18 07:29:54] <grahamperrin> Dids: please clarify the question, in relation to Gitter. Thanks.
[2017-06-18 07:32:08] <Dids> grahamperrin: In this particular case, I accidentally setup several integrations in my own community's Lobby, then later removed these integrations and added them to specific channels (rooms) instead. That's all fine and good, but now my Lobby channel shows commits etc. under the Activity section, which I was hoping to remove since I removed the integrations.
[2017-06-18 13:00:37] <Dacankeygame_twitter> hi guys
[2017-06-18 13:43:56] <grahamperrin> Dacankeygame_twitter: hello, what is your Gitter support question?
[2017-06-18 14:05:29] <noahnu> It'd be nice if there was some way to apply filters to a channel in the client. E.g. filter out keywords, filter out a specific "conversation" (mentions between two users), or on the other side, only show posts by people who have mentioned you. Sometimes when I open up gitter after not being on for a while, I'll see that someone has "mentioned" me, but it's difficult to resume that conversation.
[2017-06-18 14:05:31] <lolmaus> How do I configure email notifications? I want most channels to notify me via email only of mentions.
[2017-06-19 00:36:37] <Lilyheart> Oh wow.  I apologize.  I thought I was in my own chat room.  Not sure what happened there!
[2017-06-19 00:54:24] <InternetUnexplorer> Lilyheart: No problem, it happens :)
[2017-06-19 10:44:38] <mydigitalself> Dids: you can't  remove activity unfortunately
[2017-06-19 10:45:39] <mydigitalself> lolmaus: long story, but email notifications work a little differently from desktop ones. best to change your default toMute. You'll still get direct mentions but not@/allmentions. You can do this by going to Notification settings anywhere, then clicking on the default option at the bottom.
[2017-06-19 10:46:13] <jimtryon> mydigitalself: Any follow up on the loading problems with Gitter on the web/desktop apps?
[2017-06-19 10:46:35] <lolmaus> mydigitalself: What's the current status of decoupling email notifications from desktop notifications?
[2017-06-19 10:47:09] <mydigitalself> it's not on the todo list at the moment, right now we're open sourcing gitter, then adding GitLab integration, so it's fallen behind the list of priorities until that work is done@lolmaus
[2017-06-19 10:47:51] <mydigitalself> jimtryon: just explain a little more what you are seeing.
[2017-06-19 10:48:32] <jimtryon> mydigitalself: Yeah, so essentially what is going on is that I’m part of a huge community called FreeCodeCamp and we probably have 100+ people joining daily and Gitter is unable to keep up with the amount of traffic.
[2017-06-19 10:48:52] <jimtryon> I’ll leave for a few hours and come back only to have to refresh my screen because the app will freeze.
[2017-06-19 10:49:14] <mydigitalself> ah, yeah we struggle with FCC's scale, it's an outlier amongst outliers
[2017-06-19 10:49:15] <jimtryon> I’ve had to refresh the app every 2 hours or so to deal with the performance issues.
[2017-06-19 10:49:29] <jimtryon> I didn’t know if there were any interim solutions or hacks I can use.
[2017-06-19 10:49:52] <mydigitalself> the best thing will be once we've open sourced is to get some contribution help from FCC, which they've offered - there are particular optimisations that can be done
[2017-06-19 10:50:04] <mydigitalself> one thing i would suggest is changing your rooms tomutenotification setting
[2017-06-19 10:50:17] <mydigitalself> that way each message isn't being processed by the read/unread logic and i think it will help a lot
[2017-06-19 10:54:32] <jimtryon> oh, that should help a little with the massive amount of activity
[2017-06-19 10:54:48] <jimtryon> it’s got to be one of the biggest communities
[2017-06-19 10:55:33] <mydigitalself> yeah it's easily 10x bigger than any other community
[2017-06-19 10:56:00] <jimtryon> yeah and I even have a pretty modern mac with 8gb ram
[2017-06-19 10:56:14] <jimtryon> so when it freezes every 2 hours, sometimes it can get to the point where I have to restart
[2017-06-19 10:56:26] <jimtryon> not sure if that is a memory/proc issue though
[2017-06-19 10:57:13] <mydigitalself> do you have a lot of 1:1 conversations too - i.e. your list ofAll Conversationsis it stupidly long?
[2017-06-19 10:57:43] <jimtryon> yeah, I do have a lot of 1-1 conversations, let me grab a screenshot
[2017-06-19 10:58:29] <jimtryon>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-19 10:59:01] <jimtryon> guessing at least 50 1-1 conversations in that list
[2017-06-19 16:45:27] <texas2010> :O gitter have a problem.
[2017-06-19 16:46:17] <texas2010> i used to have many pm. it was very long list. so i have to hide them.   crazy.
[2017-06-19 17:10:06] <revisualize> I currently have a problem with Gitter. I have to refresh all the time to see new messages in a chatroom.Windows 10 Enterprise, Google Chrome Incog Mode running on a fat data pipe.
[2017-06-19 17:11:17] <revisualize> Also, when I try to switch rooms... It doesn't load and I have to refresh the page.
[2017-06-19 17:11:50] <mydigitalself> revisualize:  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-19 17:12:15] <revisualize> Look at that. Thanks.
[2017-06-19 17:15:04] <texas2010> oh haha. i forget to check twitter.thanks!@mydigitalself
[2017-06-20 01:22:31] <jimtryon> mydigitalself: do you recommend I get rid of my crazy long list ofAll Conversationsto help with the processing
[2017-06-20 01:35:33] <jimtryon> is there a keyboard shortcut to hide a gitter conversation?
[2017-06-20 01:51:05] <sp3d> when I connect over IRC, I get EOF after sending PASS, USER, and NICK lines; how can I debug this?
[2017-06-20 01:56:24] <sp3d> it used to work fine, and I haven't changed anything relevant afaik
[2017-06-20 02:24:45] <PrincessColumbia> OK, I’m at the point of frustration (that may be the headache talking, but still…) I’m trying to find a Gitter chat room dedicated to Github or Github Desktop usage. I can’t imagine these not existing, but damned if I can find either anywhere on the web. Am I just not using the search function right, or do these theoretical rooms simply not exist?
[2017-06-20 02:55:06] <ElenaSalaks> We are thinking to use Gitter for a live event Q&A. Any license or privacy concerns we should be aware of?
[2017-06-20 05:57:33] <jimtryon> PrincessColumbia: I’m not finding a room dedicated to either Github or Github Desktop.
[2017-06-20 08:47:56] <mydigitalself> PrincessColumbia: there isn't anything specific to GitHub or GitHub Desktop - our rooms are mostly created by other open source projects hosted on GitHub
[2017-06-20 08:48:51] <mydigitalself> ElenaSalaks: not really, if the room is public then the conversation will be entirely public
[2017-06-20 10:49:51] <King_of_Ireland_twitter> is that you?
[2017-06-20 18:10:09] <tslaps_twitter> Good job
[2017-06-20 18:10:52] <PrincessColumbia> jimtryon: Alright, thanks for looking into that.
[2017-06-20 19:32:35] <mertyildiran> It could be a stupid question but what is the meaning of  emoji?
[2017-06-20 19:37:59] <mertyildiran> Sorry, apperantly I read [<-LINK->] without paying enough attention last time 
[2017-06-20 20:09:38] <karlw00t> is there a bug tracker of the android gitter app?
[2017-06-21 04:52:02] <sp3d> it's been a day or so, so asking again: anyone know why I get EOF after sending PASS, USER, and NICK to the IRC bridge?
[2017-06-21 04:53:41] <InternetUnexplorer> sp3d: I would send
[2017-06-21 04:53:44] <InternetUnexplorer> A support email.
[2017-06-21 04:54:35] <InternetUnexplorer> ... Sorry about that, the Gitter app is somewhat poorly designed, and sends whatever you have typed when you rotate the screen.
[2017-06-21 04:56:00] <InternetUnexplorer> Anyways, if you haven't contacted Gitter support directly via email you should do that.
[2017-06-21 04:56:32] <sp3d> ok
[2017-06-21 10:53:15] <mydigitalself> sp3d: try in [<-LINK->] perhaps? i assume you are being disconnected, some IRC clients like to connect differently with a server password and you also need to ensure you are connecting via SSL
[2017-06-21 10:53:42] <mydigitalself> this also may help

[2017-06-21 20:49:41] <terrysahaidak> Just builded and posted new release of GitterMobile – fully (almost) featured native mobile client for Android (and iOS). [<-LINK->] Give it a try and post some feedback.It's open source, so everyone can contribute to it, open issues and submit PRs.

[2017-06-22 16:42:03] <t-mullen> Hi, I'm interested in adding WebRTC voice calls to Gitter. I planned to do it as an extension, but is there is a way to contribute to the core project?
[2017-06-22 17:21:56] <cbj4074> RationalCoding: Hello! I know that since the GitLab acquisition the Gitter team is in the process of open-sourcing the code-base, but I don't know how far along that project is, or which parts are available as yet. Maybe someone else can provide more detail.
[2017-06-22 17:22:10] <cbj4074> The short answer is that, eventually, yes, there will be (that's my understanding, anyway).
[2017-06-23 05:45:45] <t-mullen> cbj4074: Great to hear! Hope that's the case.
[2017-06-23 10:44:25] <cavapoo2_twitter> currently using gitter via firefox in browser. is there much difference if i used the windows desktop app ?
[2017-06-23 11:18:32] <earthat> HI, I am trying to add my gitter channel in my wordpress blog. I am getting this error when click on start chat option in my websiteat ServerResponse.res.render [as _render] (/opt/gitter/gitter-webapp/node_modules/fflip/lib/fflip.js:236:8)
[2017-06-23 11:18:46] <earthat> My website is [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-23 12:25:33] <cbj4074> cavapoo2_twitter: Not much difference. The desktop app is a Chromium instance (just a "wrapper"), so they are basically the same.
[2017-06-23 13:25:00] <abishekvashok> Can we use the gitter logo for a gitter based android chat client
[2017-06-23 13:29:34] <abishekvashok> A reply would have been awesome
[2017-06-23 14:21:56] <cavapoo2_twitter> cbj4074: thanks
[2017-06-23 14:31:04] <cbj4074> abishekvashok: You may want to submit a formal request for permission. You might start with [<-LINK->] .
[2017-06-23 14:32:02] <cbj4074> I suspect that GitLab will decline if your intention is to use the Gitter logo for your application's icon, as it would make it difficult for end-users to know that they are installing your app and not the official app. But I may be wrong.
[2017-06-23 17:36:53] <totalhdeveloper_twitter> Ok Thanks!
[2017-06-24 05:17:49] <siriniok> Hi, guys!I removed an organization on Github and seems like I lost permissions to manage my rooms and organization on Gitter... Can you remove the organization ( [<-LINK->] ) and rooms completely, please? (The community page redirects to 404 already, but the rooms still exist.)
[2017-06-24 09:03:07] <grahamperrin> grahamperrin: browses [<-LINK->] for GitterMobile
[2017-06-24 13:16:39] <cguttweb> Hello all I have been redirected to ask about embedding youtube videos. Someone just added a link to a video in a chat I'm in and it appears massive - is there a way to reduce the size or stop them expanding the full width of the chat?
[2017-06-24 14:25:21] <cbj4074> I've been a longtime proponent of not auto-expanding YouTube clips at all. I hate it.
[2017-06-24 14:26:42] <cguttweb> Glad it's not just me that finds it a bit annoying it appears to do the same with codepen links too. Is that to stop it or like hide them unless you click on that to see them or something?
[2017-06-24 14:42:20] <cbj4074> Yeah, there's a Collapse option on messages that contain embedded content. I think it should be collapsed by default. It's annoying as hell (and people abuse it with pr0n and such).
[2017-06-24 14:44:28] <cguttweb> Ah cool thanks@cbj4074:) and yep should definitely be collapsed by default imo
[2017-06-24 14:47:08] <InternetUnexplorer> You could probably make a simple userscript which collapses messages by default.
[2017-06-24 14:47:59] <cguttweb> A bit beyond my skill level but I now know it is collapsible which is fine for now
[2017-06-24 14:52:06] <cbj4074> cguttweb: No problem :D
[2017-06-24 15:29:56] <geekyi> cguttweb: I was gonna say I have a userscript, but then I realized it was only for scrolling embedded content. You can also type/collapse-allto do it
[2017-06-24 15:31:31] <geekyi> geekyi: 
[2017-06-24 15:44:32] <cguttweb> geekyi: ok cool good to know thanks
[2017-06-24 16:55:30] <tooomm> is it possible to update the activity feed on the right with a custom webhook (from zapier.com)?anybody using this combination?
[2017-06-25 04:20:02] <arch-master> tooomm: try room settings > integrations > custom.
[2017-06-25 07:54:25] <tooomm> i know that one, but i miss some real documentation on what is needed or what to do exactly to make it work
[2017-06-25 13:54:49] <trijezdci> How long does it  take for Gitter to be able to see a user's ogranisation membership after third party access for gitter has been approved and shows in the third party application access policy page of the organisation?
[2017-06-25 13:55:21] <trijezdci> I can't do anything, gitter claims it can's see my org, but everything is enabled according to github
[2017-06-25 20:52:03] <cguttweb> 
[2017-06-26 05:25:56] <grahamperrin> cguttweb: @cbj4074@geekyi@InternetUnexplorer [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-06-26 12:46:14] <cbj4074> grahamperrin: Thanks 
[2017-06-26 12:54:45] <geekyi> grahamperrin: @cbj4074I like@abhisekp's [<-LINK->] on that bug.Also, I feel embeds don't bother me as much as it used to.Not sure why; one or more of:the communities I frequent are aware and are careful to not link to embeds that often
the embeds are smaller (I remember I had to implement some code to scroll gists at one point)
other improvements in embed displays
[2017-06-27 03:51:23] <earthat> HI, I am trying to add my gitter channel in my wordpress blog. I am getting this error when click on start chat option in my websiteat ServerResponse.res.render [as _render] (/opt/gitter/gitter-webapp/node_modules/fflip/lib/fflip.js:236:8)
[2017-06-27 06:24:46] <Bellorosa> Hi! I'm having a stupid problem, how do you delete the windows gitter app? It's not showing up on my programs panel but it starts up anyway every time I restart the computer.
[2017-06-27 06:26:19] <Bellorosa> Would appreciate any help, I need to empty my computer before handing it over to other people
[2017-06-27 06:26:47] <Bellorosa> Otherwise I need to delete my account and I'd hate that :(
[2017-06-27 06:27:51] <jimtryon> Bellorosa: You can probably find the app in Program Files in Windows
[2017-06-27 06:38:49] <Bellorosa> jimtryon: nope, there is nothing. Tried to find it from the terminal too, but it says "volume in drive C has no label"
[2017-06-27 06:39:11] <Bellorosa> So I take there are no files left on my hard drive but somehow Gitter still manages to start itself up
[2017-06-27 06:42:52] <jimtryon> Bellorosa:  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-27 06:43:49] <jimtryon> You can also try a program called Revo Uninstaller. I used to use that one
[2017-06-27 06:49:57] <Bellorosa> Thanks Jim, I'll try that!
[2017-06-27 07:55:46] <InternetUnexplorer> Bellorosa:  [<-LINK->] is a guide for completely uninstalling Gitter on Windows for future reference.
[2017-06-27 07:57:34] <InternetUnexplorer> Even if you've already removed it using Revo Uninsaller, I would still recommend checking over the steps briefly to make sure everything is deleted; there are a lot of parts to the desktop app that aren't obviously connected.
[2017-06-27 22:23:00] <creature> As a bit of product feedback, you folk make itpreeeetty hardto find the "Stop emailing me notifications" setting. Apparently I have to go to a channel, click "Notifications", spot & click "Configure Defaults", and then uncheck the email box. If I don't find the "Configure defaults" section, there's no "Stop notifying me completely" option, which is what I really wanted in this case.
[2017-06-27 22:23:28] <creature> I would have expected to find some kind of overall settings section for my user, and that'd include something about whether I'd like to be emailed or not.
[2017-06-27 23:24:15] <tech4him1> Do you guys have a timeline for integrating with GitLab?
[2017-06-27 23:24:47] <nafg> Is that the plan?
[2017-06-28 00:41:07] <Katze21> Hi Mike. thanks for youar advice. I was confused in the defference of the notifications select item from  what told in the tutorial challenge. Now that i think probably Ok. I'm going to proceed the nexxt step soon.
[2017-06-28 14:44:06] <chusutunho_twitter> Hi everyone!
[2017-06-28 14:44:53] <chusutunho_twitter> how can I sent an image in chat room?
[2017-06-28 14:45:20] <InternetUnexplorer> Use markdown, paste the link, or drag the file into your browser window.
[2017-06-28 14:46:48] <chusutunho_twitter> Thank you@InternetUnexplorer
[2017-06-28 14:47:17] <InternetUnexplorer> np
[2017-06-28 17:22:44] <StanleyGoldman> Hi@MadLittleMods
[2017-06-28 17:23:16] <StanleyGoldman> can you explain why I cannot create a Room/Channel named Unity under [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-28 17:31:07] <StanleyGoldman> I get the message "You cannot create a channel with a same name that as an already existing repo"
[2017-06-28 17:36:16] <StanleyGoldman> nevermind, seems i have worked out my issues
[2017-06-28 17:36:18] <StanleyGoldman> thanks
[2017-06-28 19:46:44] <karlbateman> Hey all, any links to IRC integration?

[2017-06-28 20:44:22] <karlbateman> MadLittleMods: Thank you
[2017-06-28 22:42:55] <terrysahaidak> Just posted new release of my GitterMobile — unofficial Gitter mobile client for android (and ios). [<-LINK->] New login screens and fixed some issues with small screens. Also fixed reading messages ability on android.
[2017-06-29 00:58:57] <grahamperrin> tech4him1:  [<-LINK->] the expectation was:
[2017-06-29 01:00:09] <grahamperrin> … remove some internal configuration and operating parameters from the Gitter source code. We expect to have this completed and to move the code over to GitLab.com no later than June 2017.
[2017-06-29 04:19:08] <jayvdb> two days to go
[2017-06-29 07:47:52] <abhiram75> What's the major difference between angular 4, react.js, vue.js??
[2017-06-29 08:55:39] <natebass> abhiram75: idk, you can try asking in an angular chat room [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-29 15:54:00] <InternetUnexplorer> dale3h: It depends. If it's a critical issue, you should probably send a private support email. Otherwise, I would open an issue on GitHub.
[2017-06-29 15:54:32] <dale3h> InternetUnexplorer: I feel that it is pretty critical. What is the support email?
[2017-06-29 15:55:50] <InternetUnexplorer> I believe [<-LINK->] , but if it is very critical perhaps you should directly ask Gitter staff here how they would like you to report it.
[2017-06-29 15:56:35] <InternetUnexplorer> I'm not familiar with their process for disclosing vulnerabilities, so I would recommend asking them directly.
[2017-06-29 15:56:52] <MiyamotoAkira> Would you consider this critical? (this message was sent by@dale3h)
[2017-06-29 15:57:27] <InternetUnexplorer> It depends. Do you have access to that account?
[2017-06-29 15:57:41] <InternetUnexplorer> I'm guessing you don't, but it doesn't hurt to check.
[2017-06-29 15:57:58] <dale3h> I gained access to it via the vulnerability.
[2017-06-29 15:58:14] <InternetUnexplorer> And you could theoretically do this for any account?
[2017-06-29 15:58:31] <dale3h> If the account is using Windows or Linux desktop client, yes.
[2017-06-29 15:59:09] <InternetUnexplorer> That sounds like a very serious issue. I would mentionMadLittleModsormydigitalselfand ask them how they would like you to submit a report.
[2017-06-29 16:02:12] <dale3h> I always get nervous when discovering security vulnerabilities. Please understand that my intent is for white hat purposes, not for malicious intent.@MadLittleMods @mydigitalself How would you guys recommend that I send a report regarding this vulnerability?
[2017-06-29 16:11:15] <mydigitalself> dale3h: you are welcome to email me mike at gitter im
[2017-06-29 16:11:27] <dale3h> Thank you. Will email you now.
[2017-06-29 16:11:32] <mydigitalself> 
[2017-06-29 16:15:56] <mydigitalself> creature: you can basically do it in one click from the email itself
[2017-06-29 16:17:06] <mydigitalself> @tech4him1 not yet, we're just wrapping up open sourcing gitter first, as we deemed that more important that integration. so we'll move onto integration next.@suprememoocow and i are working together today to finish up final open source bits and documentation, so really excited to be publishing it soon!
[2017-06-29 17:53:50] <tech4him1> Sounds awesome@mydigitalself!
[2017-06-29 20:10:55] <InternetUnexplorer> FirnSage: It's difficult to understand what you are asking. Please see StackOverflow's how to ask article.
You've posted a general question in the Gitter support room. Please pay attention to the messages you get when joining a room.
[2017-06-29 20:11:27] <InternetUnexplorer> Please rephrase your question and post elsewhere once you have done so.
[2017-06-29 20:15:46] <FirnSage> InternetUnexplorer nevermind got it.thank u
[2017-06-30 01:14:43] <jaredjones1> Is there a room for the Java community ?
[2017-06-30 04:38:21] <lakshit1001> HeyWhy doesn't gitter  support google or FB login ?
[2017-06-30 05:34:59] <InternetUnexplorer> jaredjones1: I don't think so.
[2017-06-30 07:48:11] <rebolek> How can I get user info using API? There isGET /v1/userfor current user, but how to get the info for other users?
[2017-06-30 09:22:23] <terrysahaidak> rebolek: better place to ask is [<-LINK->] 
[2017-06-30 09:22:39] <rebolek> terrysahaidak: thanks, I will.
[2017-06-30 09:24:28] <InternetUnexplorer> terrysahaidak: It might be better to ask here. While api is a more suitable room, I don't know if it gets that much activity.Anyways, it can't hurt to try.
[2017-06-30 09:36:39] <terrysahaidak> yeah, sure, but there are many sides of API i already familiar with, so i can help, but i will see posts only in api channel because i really rarely read this channel.
[2017-07-01 00:06:10] <ethanhs> So in the original blog post about Gitlab aquiring Gitter saidWhen do you plan to open-source Gitter?We have a little bit of work to do to remove some internal configuration and operating parameters from the Gitter source code. We expect to have this completed and to move the code over to GitLab.com no later than June 2017.
[2017-07-01 00:07:11] <ethanhs> How is this going? Im really happy that my favorite developer chat app is open sourcing! Thanks!
[2017-07-01 06:09:27] <jayvdb> A few days ago someone said they were getting close to finishing
[2017-07-01 06:09:47] <ethanhs> Hi that is great news!

[2017-07-02 15:26:09] <tom-davies> Hey! I'm wondering if someone could help me with getting a brige to Matrix working? I've got one room that won't work.
[2017-07-02 20:04:10] <dfolch> I recall that the iPhone app used to send me notifications when a new message came in. I have Notifications turned on, but don’t get any. How can I get this going again?
[2017-07-03 08:00:02] <mydigitalself> ethanhs: we're aiming to publish the code today
[2017-07-03 08:00:18] <ethanhs> That is really super news!
[2017-07-03 08:01:29] <ethanhs> thanks for letting me know
[2017-07-03 10:12:13] <InternetUnexplorer> mydigitalself: Whoa.
[2017-07-03 10:12:24] <InternetUnexplorer> I'm looking forward to it :)
[2017-07-03 10:40:37] <mydigitalself> @/all If you have any spare time, we'd love you to try out the Gitter open source repo. we've started with Mac instructions, but should be fairly simple to reproduce on Windows/Linux.https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/We'll make a more public announcement on it a little later, but feel free to get involved and join us in https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/contributing to discuss.
[2017-07-03 10:42:25] <InternetUnexplorer>       
[2017-07-03 10:44:06] <mydigitalself> also note we are using that GitLab project for issues moving forward, the issues on GitHub have been migrated over and disabled.
[2017-07-03 10:46:25] <InternetUnexplorer> mydigitalself: It seems that all of the comments on the issues were lost during migration. Was this intended and are you aware of this?
[2017-07-03 10:54:08] <mydigitalself> hmmm, nope, the comments were moved over as well. if they didn't match a GitLab user, they would have been created under@suprememoocow's account
[2017-07-03 10:55:04] <mydigitalself> hmmm, looks some some of the more recent ones don't appear to be there
[2017-07-03 10:55:56] <mydigitalself> e.g. [<-LINK->] is fine
[2017-07-03 10:57:38] <InternetUnexplorer> It seems to be somewhat random.For example, myself and several others commented on [<-LINK->] a few months ago, and our comments are missing.
[2017-07-03 11:05:32] <mydigitalself> yeah i see, will have to try and figure out what happened and how to recover them.
[2017-07-03 11:32:24] <suprememoocow> Thanks for pointing that out@InternetUnexplorer. We'll definitely need to resolve this!
[2017-07-03 15:40:47] <grahamperrin> I wonder why I did not have a GitLab account until today. Was GitLab previously limited access, invitation-only or something like that?
[2017-07-03 15:45:20] <InternetUnexplorer> grahamperrin: Nope.
[2017-07-03 15:45:53] <InternetUnexplorer> What I find strange is, even though I have a GitLab (I don't use it very much), my comments on Gitter issues weren't transferred.
[2017-07-03 15:53:13] <Aadyashakti> HII purchased some VERI by paying ETH. That transaction failed showing " Warning! Error encountered during contract execution [Bad jump destination] " But I have not yet got my ETH back. Can someone help me what I will do next to get my ETH please
[2017-07-03 16:22:23] <mydigitalself> Aadyashakti: wrong place - [<-LINK->] 
[2017-07-03 16:31:51] <mydigitalself> InternetUnexplorer: the issue comments should be fixed now
[2017-07-03 16:32:30] <InternetUnexplorer> mydigitalself: Seems to be working, thanks (and congrats on the big release)!
[2017-07-03 16:32:36] <mydigitalself> 
[2017-07-03 19:50:15] <TheDiamondYT1> Since when is gitter open source?
[2017-07-03 19:50:34] <ethanhs> It was open sourced today :P
[2017-07-03 19:50:48] <ethanhs> A lot of the apps etc have been open source
[2017-07-03 19:50:50] <TheDiamondYT1> And why is "Gitter chat for GitHub" code hosted on gitlab
[2017-07-03 19:50:59] <TheDiamondYT1> We need the Android app source!
[2017-07-03 19:51:01] <ethanhs> Gitter was bought by Gitlab
[2017-07-03 19:51:06] <TheDiamondYT1> Oh
[2017-07-03 19:51:14] <TheDiamondYT1> I thought it was owned by Troupe
[2017-07-03 19:52:31] <ethanhs> That is the company that makes Gitter that I believe was bought by gitlab
[2017-07-03 19:52:39] <ethanhs> but I am not certain with the particulars
[2017-07-03 19:52:48] <TheDiamondYT1> It mustve been for alot
[2017-07-03 19:53:15] <ethanhs> Ah, "As of March 15, 2017, Troupe Technology Ltd. operates as a subsidiary of Gitlab Inc."
[2017-07-03 19:53:18] <TheDiamondYT1> mydigitalself: Please say the Android app will be made open source, it lacks many features and i'd like to contribute :D
[2017-07-03 19:53:25] <TheDiamondYT1> Cool
[2017-07-03 19:53:37] <TheDiamondYT1> Where did you find that@ethanhs
[2017-07-03 19:53:41] <ethanhs>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-07-03 19:56:04] <TheDiamondYT1> Nice
[2017-07-03 19:56:21] <TheDiamondYT1> I wonder why it was decided to be made open source
[2017-07-03 19:56:38] <TheDiamondYT1> And im guessing now it'll be "Gitter chat for Gitlab" and all github support would be dropped
[2017-07-03 19:56:48] <TheDiamondYT1> Sounds like Microsoft with Minecraft Pocket Edition
[2017-07-03 19:57:42] <ethanhs> Before making wild assumptions perhaps you might want to read the blog post [<-LINK->] 
[2017-07-03 19:57:55] <Lexicality> where's the fun in that
[2017-07-03 19:58:00] <ethanhs> Also it is open source. Someone could just fork it
[2017-07-03 20:36:52] <lolmaus> I'm unable to create an organization. [<-CODE->] 
[2017-07-03 20:41:12] <TheDiamondYT1> I feel like gitter wont give support for private apis not for your use...
[2017-07-03 20:42:57] <TheDiamondYT1> lolmaus: How did you even find that url?
[2017-07-03 20:43:34] <lolmaus> TheDiamondYT1: Popped browser dev tools open.
[2017-07-03 21:26:07] <terrysahaidak> TheDiamondYT1: There is my unofficial client for android (and ios) you can give a try :) [<-LINK->] 
[2017-07-03 22:09:37] <TheDiamondYT1> I know about that already@terrysahaidak
[2017-07-04 05:47:31] <natebass> I would also be willing to work on the Android app
[2017-07-04 07:06:28] <cym13> Hi, is there a particular process to discuss security issues?
[2017-07-04 07:08:28] <cym13> nvm, I forgot that gitlab had private issues
[2017-07-04 08:35:33] <aqzt> install？
[2017-07-04 10:08:12] <InternetUnexplorer> aqzt: Is that a question?
[2017-07-04 11:01:33] <blahah> TheDiamondYT1: agreed about the android app! would love to contribute to that
[2017-07-04 11:03:53] <blahah> in general congrats and huge thanks to the Gitter team on the transition to open source - a lot of the organisations I work with will be much more likely to use gitlab now, and I can suggest it without compromising open ethics
[2017-07-04 13:00:01] <matannoam> hi, i'm having a small bit of trouble trying out the gitter codebase
[2017-07-04 13:00:23] <matannoam> i've been able to set up docker and run the background services
[2017-07-04 13:01:23] <matannoam> when i type.  .envI get the message.: no such file or directory: .env, yet I can clearly see the file listed in the directory, as well as read it
[2017-07-04 13:01:51] <matannoam> i triedchmod 755 .envand repeated. .env, but with the same result
[2017-07-04 13:02:32] <matannoam> I can just export the secrets myself, since i can read the file, but that is kind of annoying, I'm wondering if anyone knows what might be causing this problem
[2017-07-04 20:56:50] <ryanstout> How are you?  I just setup a new gitter for a github Organization.  But when I click on the community, it brings up a dialog that say "The room ... does not yet exist.  Do you want to create it?"  But when I click Create it doesn't do anything.  In the browser console there is a failed ajax request: [<-CODE->] 
[2017-07-05 01:26:56] <enkayz> wtf
[2017-07-05 01:27:18] <enkayz> so 2 of my other accounts cannot send messages to gitter anymore, api replies normally but with no 'v'/version in the json reply
[2017-07-05 01:27:27] <enkayz> and the message does not appear on anyone elses screen
[2017-07-05 01:27:49] <enkayz> logged out / in, tested all different browsers and machines
[2017-07-05 01:27:57] <enkayz> this account still works
[2017-07-05 01:28:00] <enkayz> any ideas?
[2017-07-05 06:47:48] <abhayjaiswal> Hii
[2017-07-05 08:23:41] <betcher> test
[2017-07-05 08:24:02] <betcher> It works :)
[2017-07-05 08:27:13] <enkayz> great
[2017-07-05 08:28:18] <meetmangukiya> is it possible to render diffs in gitter?
[2017-07-05 08:28:40] <meetmangukiya>  [<-CODE->] 
[2017-07-05 08:28:48] <meetmangukiya> this doesn't render well :/
[2017-07-05 08:28:54] <meetmangukiya> with ```diff```
[2017-07-05 08:31:18] <meetmangukiya> nvm, it seems like that diff is incorrect
[2017-07-05 08:45:44] <mydigitalself> enkayz: you may have a soft block on those accounts. are you doing anything weird like sending the same message through multiple times? you could have been flagged for spam/flood detection.
[2017-07-05 08:46:39] <enkayz> yeah, i was testing some command which wasn't giving the right output
[2017-07-05 08:46:47] <enkayz> so the bot was connecting, saying same thing, then disconnecting
[2017-07-05 08:46:59] <enkayz> about 5-6 times and then it stopped working
[2017-07-05 08:47:29] <enkayz> but i also have the same problem with a completely different account which is only used for chatting and not via api so it is odd
[2017-07-05 10:57:53] <lolmaus> I see this when trying to create a room.
[2017-07-05 10:58:01] <lolmaus>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-07-05 13:46:21] <GettingNifty> Alright I won't say anything since you'll just delete it
[2017-07-05 13:46:42] <GettingNifty> You forfeit your argument then
[2017-07-05 13:47:16] <InternetUnexplorer> GettingNifty: I don't have an argument, I'm getting rid of the spam you are posting.Do you have a Gitter support question?
[2017-07-05 13:48:00] <GettingNifty> No I'm leaving.
[2017-07-05 13:52:13] <matannoam> i used source instead
[2017-07-05 13:52:23] <matannoam> i case anyone saw my problem
[2017-07-05 18:28:10] <merk26> hm..
[2017-07-05 23:14:30] <jimtryon> Is the platform open source yet?
[2017-07-05 23:14:37] <jimtryon> specifically, the mobile app code?
[2017-07-05 23:14:45] <jimtryon> I feel like the mobile app is quite a few iterations behind the desktop app
[2017-07-05 23:16:13] <MadLittleMods> jimtryon: The [<-LINK->] but the mobile-app isn't public yet
[2017-07-05 23:16:58] <jimtryon> Will the mobile-app be released?
[2017-07-05 23:17:31] <MadLittleMods> jimtryon: No plans atm but most likely
[2017-07-05 23:17:33] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @MojammelWThis room is for Gitter support, not general technical help. Please read the welcome message when joining a room and mind the topic in the chat header. You can try [<-LINK->] 
[2017-07-05 23:19:10] <jimtryon> Are there any more updates planned for the mobile app? There are a few features that are missing from the mobile that would really improve the user experience
[2017-07-05 23:19:20] <jimtryon> such as being able to hover over a profile
[2017-07-05 23:23:47] <MadLittleMods> @jimtryon You can track specific issues here https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issuesJust notificed the labels didn't apply when they got transferred so it will be a bit more difficult to find but we will get that sorted
[2017-07-05 23:25:06] <jimtryon> Thanks, I’ll follow up on gitlab
[2017-07-05 23:25:27] <MadLittleMods> jimtryon: The specific issue you mentioned I am pretty sure already has an issue
[2017-07-06 07:26:38] <inl-pd-autotest> Does license permit to install and run a local copy of gitter in our company for free?
[2017-07-06 07:28:18] <inl-pd-autotest> the interface is confusing, how to get back to the channels list like in irc?
[2017-07-06 08:37:07] <andreykurilin> Hi folks!
[2017-07-06 08:37:42] <andreykurilin> I  have a simple integration-bot which uses gitter irc tunnel
[2017-07-06 08:38:08] <andreykurilin> it works perfectly from one ip address, but when I'm trying to run it at another pc, it fails to connect
[2017-07-06 08:38:30] <andreykurilin> any ideas?
[2017-07-06 11:25:43] <cedric05> when will they expose mobile app source codes
[2017-07-06 11:26:04] <cedric05> i'm interested in checking how they handle using websockets
[2017-07-06 11:26:13] <cedric05> thanks in advance
[2017-07-06 18:04:57] <fabdarice> Hi everyone, I was wondering if it's possible to change one's username ?
[2017-07-06 19:08:02] <InternetUnexplorer> fabdarice: It reflects your GitHub username, so I think you would have to change that.
[2017-07-06 23:48:09] <aghagon2000> a
[2017-07-07 01:32:13] <alphaCTzo7G> It would be awesome to be able to edit replies.. like slack..
[2017-07-07 01:54:11] <cbj4074> alphaCTzo7G: You can edit anything you send for 15 minutes...
[2017-07-07 01:54:55] <cbj4074> (in the browser and desktop clients, anyway)
[2017-07-07 01:56:17] <Paulo_Arcenio_twitter> Good evening guys ! I have a quey ! Anyone can help me?
[2017-07-07 01:56:24] <Paulo_Arcenio_twitter> query*
[2017-07-07 01:59:27] <Paulo_Arcenio_twitter> How can i change color of tabs ? Because the color standart is pink. :X
[2017-07-07 06:11:54] <jimtryon> Paulo_Arcenio_twitter: Color of what tabs? Need more information
[2017-07-07 08:58:34] <terrysahaidak> cedric05: mobile app is a webview with some native code. so it's do not do native stuff with sockets.but you can look at [<-LINK->] for androidand [<-LINK->] for iOS
[2017-07-07 14:48:35] <kvark> Hello! Where can I submit an issue?
[2017-07-07 14:50:04] <kvark> Basically, Gitter starts to abuse the CPU by doing lots of messaging from JS after a few sleep cycles on a laptop. I have the perf recording here - [<-LINK->] 
[2017-07-07 16:54:17] <sbromberger> Hi all
[2017-07-07 16:54:26] <sbromberger> why does Gitter require write access to integrate with github repos?
[2017-07-07 17:05:35] <cbj4074> sbromberger:  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-07-07 17:05:45] <sbromberger> These are public repos,@cbj4074
[2017-07-07 17:06:42] <sbromberger> If I’m not mistaken there are read-only permissions for public repos.
[2017-07-07 17:08:10] <sbromberger>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-07-07 17:08:21] <sbromberger> (that’s to LightGraphs.jl, which is public)
[2017-07-07 17:09:34] <cbj4074> Yeah, I'm not sure as to the details... I just know I thought the same thing way back when, "What the hell?!"
[2017-07-07 17:09:45] <cbj4074> Maybe someone internal can comment (I'm just an end-user).
[2017-07-07 17:10:01] <sbromberger> heh, yeah. I like Gitter, but there's no way in hell it will get write access to my repos.
[2017-07-07 17:10:28] <cbj4074> Agreed :D
[2017-07-07 17:20:07] <alphaCTzo7G> @cbj4074 well I am not able to edit anything within 15 minutes of posting or after 15 minutes of posting..edit.. actually apparently I can edit within 15 minutes of posting.. Thanks!
[2017-07-07 17:37:22] <cbj4074> alphaCTzo7G: No prob 
[2017-07-07 19:12:45] <TheDiamondYT1> When's the Android app open source -_-
[2017-07-07 19:14:36] <MadLittleMods> TheDiamondYT1: There aren't any immediate plans. We are focusing on the webapp and GitLab integration atm
[2017-07-07 19:28:07] <TheDiamondYT1> MadLittleMods: How hard can it be to do something like [<-CODE->] 
[2017-07-07 21:16:43] <bikrambhattacharya> help needed. anyone? how to find a file in a big database with issue [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-07-08 07:43:30] <grahamperrin> VegeTTa121: Gitter is not VALVE, STEAM or Counter Strike.

[2017-07-08 07:46:49] <grahamperrin> MadLittleMods:  [<-LINK->] is outdated. Please, where should such issues be reported? I imagined [<-LINK->] 'GitLab.com Support Tracker' but then,
[2017-07-08 07:47:01] <grahamperrin> … This issue tracker is only for support issues pertaining to GitLab.com repositories. …
[2017-07-08 07:47:20] <grahamperrin> – not forabout.gitlab.com.
[2017-07-08 07:48:57] <grahamperrin> bikrambhattacharya: that's no longer found, is it [<-LINK->] ?

[2017-07-08 10:20:26] <grahamperrin> Ouch, has the transition to GitLab lost track of issues to which I was subscribed? [<-LINK->] for example, in Firefox before the transition I had a tab open to [<-ISSUE->] and I can't imagine that I was not subscribed. But I'm not subscribed in GitLab :-(
[2017-07-09 16:24:27] <MadLittleMods> grahamperrin: Subscriptions won't be carried over
[2017-07-09 16:24:47] <MadLittleMods> grahamperrin: At the bottom, there is a link to source file of that page. You can submit a MR, [<-LINK->] 
[2017-07-10 18:49:26] <LWSS> anyone here know anyone at github?
[2017-07-10 18:49:35] <LWSS> my account got flagged and i've been trying for a few days to contact them
[2017-07-10 20:34:19] <grahamperrin> :-( thanks, hey ho
[2017-07-11 00:38:27] <jayvdb> LWSS: , contact GitHub support by their contact form
[2017-07-11 16:28:31] <TylerJPresley> Is there a way to block users
[2017-07-11 16:28:59] <TylerJPresley> I'm starting to get spam PMs
[2017-07-11 16:30:06] <MadLittleMods> TylerJPresley: There isn't a way to block someone in the UI. Send me their username and some example messages in a one to one orsupport@gitter.imand I can take care of it
[2017-07-11 16:32:59] <TylerJPresley> MadLittleMods: TY. Sent a PM.
[2017-07-11 16:34:29] <MadLittleMods> TylerJPresley: Thanks for the report, handled 
[2017-07-11 16:34:31] <Dorus> Quick q: How do i report users/spam?
[2017-07-11 16:34:51] <Dorus> Just emailsupport@gitter.im?
[2017-07-11 16:34:58] <MadLittleMods> Dorus: See just above  [<-LINK->]

[2017-07-11 16:58:40] <sbromberger> sounds like a dead / low-priority issue :)
[2017-07-11 19:45:16] <KimiNewt> Hello, I've been trying to create a gitter for my github repo and when I attempt to create it it says "This address is not available". I checked the URL and it doesn't seem to exist, and nothing comes up in the search either
[2017-07-11 19:46:00] <matanster> I am getting email notifications for every gitter room, regardless of selecting to be notified only of direct mentions and announcements.
[2017-07-11 19:46:03] <matanster> Is it only me?
[2017-07-11 19:46:15] <matanster> It all started when I joined a new room after a long time of no usage
[2017-07-11 19:46:43] <MadLittleMods> KimiNewt: What is the repo? It sounds like you need to associate it with the repo. If it isn't appearing in the typeahead or auto-associating you probably need to allow private repo access for yourself or the org to get the access tokens scopes to match up
[2017-07-11 19:47:20] <MadLittleMods> matanster: You need to set a room to "Mute" to not get email notifications. Emails are tied to the green unread badges
[2017-07-11 19:47:32] <KimiNewt> It auto-associated, and it's not private. The repo is pyshark
[2017-07-11 19:49:00] <KimiNewt>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-07-11 19:50:07] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] I assume you are after creating a room for this repo, https://github.com/KimiNewt/pyshark
[2017-07-11 19:50:33] <KimiNewt> Correct. Do I have to create a kiminewt community first?
[2017-07-11 19:51:06] <MadLittleMods> Thanks for the image. [<-LINK->] already exists so you can't use that URL
[2017-07-11 19:51:27] <KimiNewt> Oh. Darn.
[2017-07-11 19:52:03] <MadLittleMods> KimiNewt: You can change the URL of the community or create akiminewtcommunity withpysharkas a room in that community
[2017-07-11 19:52:13] <KimiNewt> Because of an account with zero contribution made years after I made the repo :(
[2017-07-11 19:52:52] <KimiNewt> Alright. Creating a kiminewt community seems a bit egocentric since it's just my nickname. I'll have to come up with a different URL. Creative URLs are, I imagine, outside the scope of this channel
[2017-07-11 21:43:38] <InternetUnexplorer> Thanks for the image. https://github.com/pyshark already exists so you can't use that URLI'm not sure I understand how this works. For example, I can't create a community, because the name is already taken (by me!):
[2017-07-11 21:44:41] <MadLittleMods> InternetUnexplorer:  [<-LINK->] already exists
[2017-07-11 21:47:03] <InternetUnexplorer> Whoa, I never noticed that! I must've created it on accident at some point.To clarify: Is it the case that you cannot create a community if a user/community of the same name exists on GitHub, regardless of whether or not they use Gitter?
[2017-07-11 22:58:58] <MadLittleMods> InternetUnexplorer: Correct
[2017-07-12 21:41:46] <freefrancisco> hey guys, I just started using gitter, I logged in with twitter first and downloaded the Mac OS X app, but then I found some rooms that required me to be logged in with github, so I logged out in the browser and logged back in with github, but I can't find how to logout of the desktop app to make my account a github account only
[2017-07-12 21:42:27] <freefrancisco> or how to add my github account to the twitter login so it knows that I have a github account too
[2017-07-12 21:50:07] <freefrancisco_twitter> this is my twitter account from the desktop app right now, I can't logout to login with github
[2017-07-12 22:11:25] <MadLittleMods> freefrancisco: See [<-LINK->] 
[2017-07-12 22:16:23] <freefrancisco> Thanks!  I didn't realize there was a menu bar option, I was clicking on my picture on the main app, looking in the menu, and using the command-comma to look for something in the options.  Gitter n00b :-)
[2017-07-13 16:18:22] <Osmiogrzesznik> Hello. I'd like to say that it would be nice to have paste option in message input field on iOS devices (i am using iphone 6, iOS10.3.- up to date system) something lack of it renders the app useless for code communication .
[2017-07-13 16:19:55] <Osmiogrzesznik> By paste i mean paste accepted from external res. , or even just from earlier conversation posts
[2017-07-13 16:22:14] <Osmiogrzesznik> Sorry , oaste from external srcs works , but when i am copying the content of code field in conversation it doesn't show the paste option.

[2017-07-13 16:33:38] <JarrettBillingsley> these previews are ridiculous
[2017-07-13 17:44:32] <grahamperrin> I see no preview.
[2017-07-13 17:44:48] <JarrettBillingsley> are you on mobile?
[2017-07-13 17:44:58] <JarrettBillingsley> I'm in the browser; it takes up literally the entire screen
[2017-07-13 17:46:03] <grahamperrin> Firefox 54.0.1 (64-bit) on FreeBSD-CURRENT.

[2017-07-13 17:46:37] <JarrettBillingsley> Firefox 45 ESR on debian
[2017-07-13 17:46:46] <JarrettBillingsley> though it happens on every browser/system I have
[2017-07-13 17:47:06] <JarrettBillingsley> maybe it's because I follow them that I get the preview? but previews in gitter are uniformly enormous
[2017-07-13 17:47:24] <JarrettBillingsley> everyone always apologizes after linking a video
[2017-07-13 17:51:48] <cbj4074> Yet another reason for which previews should be hidden by default.
[2017-07-13 17:55:19] <JarrettBillingsley>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-07-13 17:55:30] <JarrettBillingsley> I bet this gets everyone's attention
[2017-07-13 18:00:20] <JarrettBillingsley> and it re-autoplays every time you switch rooms! 
[2017-07-13 18:12:24] <cbj4074> JarrettBillingsley: Trying to find the existing issue about this for you, so you can thumbs-up it, but the migration to GitLab has pretty much wrecked the Issue list.
[2017-07-13 18:13:36] <MadLittleMods> cbj4074: Working on getting it better [<-LINK->] 
[2017-07-13 18:14:44] <cbj4074> JarrettBillingsley:  [<-LINK->]

[2017-07-13 18:21:07] <JarrettBillingsley> 
[2017-07-13 18:22:02] <JarrettBillingsley> I'd get a gitlab account to  it but somehow I doubt it would have much impact.
[2017-07-13 18:22:20] <JarrettBillingsley> probably easier to make a greasemonkey script
[2017-07-13 18:42:57] <cbj4074> Yep... well, at least we'll be able to start fixing things ourselves soon.
[2017-07-13 18:45:12] <grahamperrin> Will [<-LINK->] result in content that was created by me (in GitHub) showing as created by me in GitLab?
[2017-07-13 18:47:26] <rbrlortie> How can I mute a channel / disable notifications?
[2017-07-13 18:48:26] <grahamperrin> rbrlortie: Room settings
[2017-07-13 18:48:40] <grahamperrin> Icon: three sliders
[2017-07-13 18:49:37] <grahamperrin> There's also an option to hide. Left panel. Menu icon: three dots.
[2017-07-13 18:50:01] <rbrlortie> Oh, you are right, since user profile is up there I assumed that those were global settings and not room settings. Cheers!
[2017-07-14 14:59:41] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @grahamperrinOnly if you have a GitLab account and the public email address(separate field from email) on both GitHub and GitLab are the same
[2017-07-14 15:06:56] <cbj4074> MadLittleMods: Does that apply retroactively, or did that need to be in-place prior to "migrating" the issues?
[2017-07-14 16:29:34] <MadLittleMods> cbj4074: In place before new migration
[2017-07-14 17:07:49] <cbj4074> MadLittleMods: Okay, thanks for clarifying!
[2017-07-15 10:39:40] <grahamperrin> MadLittleMods: thanks, I probably fit the criteria.
[2017-07-15 10:41:03] <grahamperrin> Maybe broadcast an announcement before the next migration? Reduce the likelihood of other people missing the boat ...
[2017-07-15 10:46:46] <grahamperrin> GitLab web not allowing login at the moment, I'll check later.
[2017-07-15 14:42:21] <cbj4074> I second that. An email blast beforehand would have been nice.
[2017-07-16 22:02:01] <jo-elimuai> Hi. Is it possible to delete a room that I created under a community?
[2017-07-16 22:11:27] <MadLittleMods> @jo-elimuai Yes, if you are an admin
[2017-07-16 22:11:55] <jo-elimuai> Ok, got it. Thanks :-)
[2017-07-16 22:31:44] <serapath> MadLittleMods: hey, i would like to propose a kind of important feature for gitter given, that many users are coders and many channels are about learning/teaching coding.It would be very helpful, if code snippets posted in markdown would include line numbers
[2017-07-16 22:32:38] <serapath> Another question...  my github organization was renamed fromwizardamigosinstitutetowizardamigosquite some time ago, but the gitter channel doesnt update it's name. Is it possible to do that and make an auto-forwarding for users who still have the old link? :-)
[2017-07-17 04:16:13] <MadLittleMods> serapath: See [<-LINK->] 
[2017-07-17 14:23:29] <andreykurilin> MadLittleMods: hi! can you help me with irc tunnel? It doesn't work for me any more. (I can connect only from the one specific machine)
[2017-07-17 15:12:49] <izzaboo> Howdy! Is there a gitterHQ room specifically for the Android app?
[2017-07-17 15:13:12] <izzaboo> Or better question: Where's best place to ask Qs about Android app?
[2017-07-17 15:14:10] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @andreykurilinSSL checkbox on both?
[2017-07-17 15:15:00] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @izzabooHere is good. There isn't an Android app room
[2017-07-17 15:16:28] <andreykurilin> MadLittleMods: yes. Actually, I have simple script and it works at my vm in the cloud, but when I'm trying to launch the same script with same config at my local pc - it fails to connect (I do not have any problems with firewal and the problem is reproducable by another guy from another country)
[2017-07-17 15:19:38] <izzaboo> Thanks,@MadLittleMods
[2017-07-17 15:20:09] <andreykurilin> MadLittleMods: If I re-launch the script at the vm, it doesn't have any problems with reconnect
[2017-07-17 15:20:26] <izzaboo> Notifications aren't working on my android handset nor on a tablet I have...is that a known issue...or just me?
[2017-07-17 15:21:00] <izzaboo> Notifications seem to be functioning fine on several iOS devices I support

[2017-07-18 07:14:56] <InternetUnexplorer> sdrausty: Not a Gitter question, see my response in gitterHQ/developers.
[2017-07-18 07:16:26] <InternetUnexplorer> zebralight: I don't think there is a room specifically for git. Most of the rooms here are for a specific repository or organization.Your best bet would probably be to find a "general" chat room (e.g. gitterHQ/developers) and ask there.
[2017-07-18 13:46:13] <mstellaluna> Hello. I have a question about Gitter functionality.
[2017-07-18 13:46:32] <mstellaluna> I am moderator for a community, if I remove someone from the room, are they able to rejoin the room later?
[2017-07-18 13:46:38] <mstellaluna> sorry I can't find any info on this.
[2017-07-18 13:47:13] <mstellaluna> Sorry if I'm asking in the wrong room
[2017-07-18 13:57:06] <InternetUnexplorer> mstellaluna: Yes, they can join again.
[2017-07-18 14:01:49] <InternetUnexplorer> (as opposed to a ban, where they cannot)
[2017-07-18 14:47:31] <mstellaluna> InternetUnexplorer: perfect. thank you !!

[2017-07-20 08:02:33] <mungaiandela> Hello gitter community. I want to create a room that my users could go to and find general information about Gitter functionality in a huge markdown post; Is it possible to restrict my users from posting in said room? Thanks.
[2017-07-20 11:01:36] <sunshinelike> I am sure you can make it.
[2017-07-20 11:02:42] <mungaiandela> sunshinelike: Making it is not a problem; I want to restrict any message posting on that room. Is this possible?
[2017-07-20 11:08:33] <sunshinelike> It needs a  message filtersystem.@mungaiandela
[2017-07-20 11:13:13] <sunshinelike> At present .It's seems no  this  function in gitter.
[2017-07-20 11:14:12] <mungaiandela> Okay, thanks@sunshinelike; I guess I just have to tell users not to post in that room.
[2017-07-20 11:16:51] <jo-elimuai> Hi. I'm looking at [<-LINK->] and I couldn't figure out if it's possible to use the REST API for automatically inviting new contributors to a Gitter room.

[2017-07-21 12:07:19] <vegandoc66_twitter> Good question?
[2017-07-21 12:08:32] <InternetUnexplorer> linuxchip:  [<-LINK->] , however you cannot access an IRC room using the Gitter client.
[2017-07-21 13:14:21] <linuxchip> OK gotcha, thx
[2017-07-21 13:55:29] <enkayz> can i create new channels with irc?
[2017-07-21 13:55:50] <enkayz> i'm trying to create a new channel in my community but every time i click the create room button, it pops up the dialog then immediately forwards to 'create a community'

[2017-07-23 16:22:48] <InternetUnexplorer> curtiscarlson: AFAIK there isn't one; most of the rooms here are for a specific repo or community.
[2017-07-23 21:06:06] <SalchiPapa> MadLittleMods: do you know why does@manuelvaldes46_twitteravatar doesn't show up in gitter? Is it because he has been previously marked as banned? 
[2017-07-23 23:07:08] <gordon1420> Is there any way to disable image previews?
[2017-07-23 23:07:15] <gordon1420> Or any settings at all beyond notifications?
[2017-07-23 23:15:42] <manuelvaldes46_twitter> gordon1420: hey men

[2017-07-24 19:34:40] <brendonboshell> Hey, just signed up for Gitter for the first time, but for some reason I cannot create a community - known bug?
[2017-07-24 19:40:40] <strarsis> hi
[2017-07-24 19:40:43] <strarsis> I am new to gitter.
[2017-07-24 19:41:01] <strarsis> I can just join e.g. webpack/webpack and start posting my questions there?
[2017-07-24 19:47:10] <strarsis> why do I see no answers? can anyone read my messages here?
[2017-07-24 19:47:33] <strarsis> brendonboshell: : Can you read my messages? I am new to gitter. Do I have to address someone directly (with @<nickname>) to make her/him read my messages?
[2017-07-24 19:49:02] <cbj4074> strarsis: No. We can all see your messages.
[2017-07-24 19:49:28] <cbj4074> And yes, you can just join whatever channel(s) you like and start posting messages.
[2017-07-24 19:51:02] <bikrambhattacharya> document.getElementById('meter').style.visibility = 'hidden'; why this is not working? I want to hide the meter untill the user type something
[2017-07-24 19:58:43] <cbj4074> bikrambhattacharya: No idea, but you're asking in the wrong place.
[2017-07-24 22:03:56] <rvt> hi guys/ how do I turn off people's posting's of cide and screenshots? I often see large pieces of code pasted and that really ruens the conversations
[2017-07-24 22:04:29] <rvt> I like 'IRC' style where the general rule is not to paste more than 3 lines... and I don;t want to see images, just a link to the image URL in case I want to see it
[2017-07-24 23:14:12] <cbj4074> rvt: You cannot, unfortunately. I hate it, too.
[2017-07-24 23:14:23] <cbj4074> Many of us have griped about it.
[2017-07-25 00:15:45] <rwrobbins> Is there a way I can change the name displayed for me?
[2017-07-25 00:41:20] <gordon1420> It shows your github display name, so change on there if you want it different
[2017-07-25 01:23:50] <enkayz> why don't gitter have some spoiler code tag?
[2017-07-25 03:43:58] <jayvdb> Create an issue about blocking previews and long code dumps?
[2017-07-25 04:00:59] <jayvdb> Probably a client UI config setting per room
[2017-07-25 05:55:40] <enkayz> That would be sensible
[2017-07-25 05:56:15] <enkayz> I don't mind them appearing especially when discussing code but a method to collapse would be nice and then to auto collapse for non code type fellows
[2017-07-25 06:55:52] <rvt> enkayz: I could live with the uncollapse/collapse, as long as I can set it to collapse by default
[2017-07-25 08:29:51] <InternetUnexplorer> Some sort of consistently in terms of size (including for images embedded using Markdown) would also be nice. Currently, content ranges from taking up a line or two to taking up the whole screen.
[2017-07-25 08:33:37] <InternetUnexplorer> If the sizing was more reasonable, I don't think the lack of a collapse-by-default option would be as much of an issue.
[2017-07-25 09:48:02] <rvt> this UI is one of the reason that for LibreCAD we stay away from gitter...
[2017-07-25 09:48:11] <rvt> I hope it will change one day...
[2017-07-25 09:48:50] <rvt> looking at activity on the channel... not many seem to use it anyways
[2017-07-25 13:32:12] <cbj4074> jayvdb: There is already at least one issue about this. I've posted it several times here... I'll try to find it, time permitting.
[2017-07-25 13:33:32] <cbj4074> InternetUnexplorer: The collapse-by-default option is to guard against offensive content that is usually posted with the intent to offend.
[2017-07-25 13:34:17] <cbj4074> (of course, there are well-intentioned people who post offensive content because they are clueless, socially, and don't realize that people are at work, have children nearby, etc.)
[2017-07-25 19:00:28] <AstraLuma> I can't seem to find a good answer: What's the status on groups/group mentions? I think I saw that you could add your own groups by API, but I haven't seen if they're linked to github teams or what.
[2017-07-26 15:47:06] <tech4him1> Where should I report a low priority bug in Gitter?

[2017-07-26 16:22:00] <AstraLuma> :/ thanks
[2017-07-26 16:22:25] <AstraLuma> (I really want a way to poke at all the core developers of a project, but not all the users also idling in the channel)
[2017-07-26 22:26:40] <jayvdb>  for subset pokes, esp github team pokes
[2017-07-27 07:50:48] <brendonboshell> mydigitalself: I had the same issue just now when creating a Github-based community. But then I created a non-Github community (which worked) and then created the Github-based community. The second time it worked.
[2017-07-27 10:25:54] <sorcio> Anyone got issues with the macOS desktop app? [<-LINK->] That's by trying to install the app.
[2017-07-27 19:04:15] <bmordan> I have been posting to a gitter room using the API but it has stopped working. Is there a daily limit on the API? Are there some special conditions the rooms have to be set up with?
[2017-07-27 19:04:50] <MadLittleMods> bmordan: Which user are you posting with?
[2017-07-28 03:28:03] <Maxwhereru> how to set one to one conversation
[2017-07-28 03:28:06] <Maxwhereru> ?
[2017-07-28 07:25:03] <satdav> what does the □ mean at the channel on glitter
[2017-07-28 07:25:41] <Maxwhereru> No, just one to one conversation

[2017-07-28 10:35:28] <bmordan> MadLittleMods: Hi Eric - the user posting is my bot (userId 597512d3d73408ce4f6e6e43) I (@bmordan) set up the room and added the bot - this was working when I posted in a diferent roomtable flip/bot-test-lab
[2017-07-28 10:40:17] <bmordan> My code is posting ok [<-CODE->] 
[2017-07-28 10:42:06] <bmordan> I’m POSTing with the example curl command [<-CODE->] I get the 200 ok reply but nothing appears in the room? I must be missing something?
[2017-07-28 10:49:21] <bmordan> OK I can POST using my gitter access token - but my Bot can not. :(
[2017-07-28 10:58:47] <bmordan>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-07-28 11:00:58] <bmordan> So above is a screen capture of my bot posting a message using the GUI when I click away from the room then click back - the message is gone
[2017-07-28 17:44:42] <himanshub16> Hey, how can I create a room within one of my communities. I try to click thecreate roombutton which opens #createroom and a modal. But suddenly, the url changes to #createcommunity and a new modal pops up. Is there a bug?
[2017-07-28 21:53:59] <satdav> can you merge glitter account
[2017-07-29 07:44:25] <InternetUnexplorer> satdav: no.
[2017-07-29 14:33:50] <ThorthChariot> i have a problem, yesterday o have a twitter account. I was in conversation and talk in one room, and after a small block of my Windows App, i cannot talk in that room  with that account, i can log in, but i cannot talk, write,...etc
[2017-07-29 15:36:25] <grahamperrin> ThorthChariot: do you mean that you're using the [<-LINK->] for Windows? Please, what do you mean by "small block"?
[2017-07-29 15:48:18] <ThorthChariot> grahamperrin: in that room is installet a bot :) and many of us (in that room) we're talking, i believe there was to many request to bot, and that bot freeze, and for that point forward i can log into room, i can see all the post, but i cannot write something
[2017-07-29 15:50:56] <ThorthChariot> so, i create a new account, and log in gitter, and everything is fine, but with the old account, i cannot write,...etc
[2017-07-29 22:31:24] <corysimmons> How can I ignore a specific user via web UI?

[2017-07-30 05:55:52] <jimtryon> corysimmons: If I recall, there is no way to ignore a user
[2017-07-30 05:56:10] <jimtryon> You can only hide the chat
[2017-07-30 07:08:11] <grahamperrin> corysimmons: also please subscribe to [<-LINK->]

[2017-07-31 02:46:29] <grahamperrin> ervin210: this room is for help with Gitter, not help with macOS Server.
[2017-07-31 08:47:19] <mydigitalself> bmordan: you bot my have been banned, are you sending the same message over and over within a short time period from it?
[2017-08-02 02:56:31] <daegontaven> is there a way to rename a gitter room ?
[2017-08-02 16:24:34] <johntom> the giiter app stopped displaying on one of  my win10 computers. I tried a reinstall but still fails.  Is there a way to reset properties?

[2017-08-02 19:24:26] <johntom> InternetUnexplorer: Thanks, worked as documented

[2017-08-05 07:36:29] <miohtama> I cannot find a way to add a Gitter room for a repo in my organization on a Github. I try to add it through Gitter and I get this error:
[2017-08-05 07:36:46] <miohtama>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-08-05 07:37:00] <miohtama> Is there some trick I need to perform in order to have the room available?
[2017-08-05 07:37:20] <miohtama> I tried to poke organization access settings on Github, Gitter seems to be allowed
[2017-08-05 07:39:52] <miohtama> Ah. Looks like it is messed up because I initially did not import Github organization correctly, but created an organization with same name on Gitter. Is there a way to delete an organization?
[2017-08-05 18:20:53] <kerrtrvs> Hey! I have a quick question, does your gitter profile show up in google search results like your github account does? Thanks :P
[2017-08-05 18:42:08] <grahamperrin> VutonDesign: Gitter uses your GitHub profile.
[2017-08-05 21:13:17] <kerrtrvs> So it wont show up?
[2017-08-06 06:56:15] <grahamperrin> VutonDesign: if you think of your Gitter profile as including content that is authored by you: indexing of public content, by services such as Google, was incomplete when I last checked.
[2017-08-06 08:51:47] <grahamperrin> VutonDesign:  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-08-06 08:54:47] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] a pain :-(
[2017-08-06 08:55:50] <grahamperrin> I guess I missed the boat again. Feel like the effort I put into GitHub issues  was wasted.
[2017-08-06 09:18:41] <kerrtrvs> Yeah, I get it now. Thanks!
[2017-08-07 06:06:10] <mkborregaard> Hi, is it possible to get the gitter history of a room, back in time (for this case I'm only interested in the date and time of posts – I want to visualize chat room activity over time)
[2017-08-07 06:06:44] <InternetUnexplorer> mkborregaard: Sure,
[2017-08-07 08:05:57] <mkborregaard> Thanks a lot! a bit of manual labour will do the trick from there :-)

[2017-08-07 18:39:46] <lippytak> Hi folks. Is it possible to setup a Gitter community that allows guests? I.e. doesn't require GH or Twitter auth for every user to chat?
[2017-08-07 18:40:02] <lippytak> (sorry to pop-in with a random support Q)
[2017-08-07 19:05:26] <InternetUnexplorer> lippytak: Unfortunately it's not supported at the moment.
[2017-08-07 19:25:56] <lippytak> InternetUnexplorer: alrighty, thanks
[2017-08-07 19:32:31] <tech4him1> Hello! How can I change the name that shows up with my username? Is it linked to GitHub?
[2017-08-07 19:36:22] <MadLittleMods> tech4him1: Yes, it is linked to GitHub. Sign out and sign back in to Gitter once you have changed it
[2017-08-07 19:36:52] <tech4him1> MadLittleMods: Thanks, that worked.
[2017-08-07 20:35:57] <jimtryon> How do you link to channels in a room so that other people will be able to click on it?
[2017-08-07 20:36:07] <jimtryon> So like #MyChannel
[2017-08-07 21:03:58] <MadLittleMods> jimtryon: There isn't any special syntax or decoration around room linking. You can track [<-LINK->] 
[2017-08-07 21:05:21] <jimtryon> Ok, I’ll start tracking that issue.
[2017-08-07 21:11:29] <jimtryon> MadLittleMods: Is there a way to follow issues on gitlab?
[2017-08-07 21:11:36] <jimtryon> I don’t see a follow button or track.
[2017-08-07 21:12:18] <MadLittleMods> jimtryon: Once you are signed in, there is a "Subscribe" button in the sidebar [<-LINK->] 
[2017-08-07 21:12:41] <jimtryon> I don’t see a Subscribe button.
[2017-08-07 21:12:49] <jimtryon> When I followed your link to the issue
[2017-08-07 21:13:24] <jimtryon> It was hidden in the sidebar. Found it

[2017-08-09 12:01:22] <SleeperSmith> hi guys, any one can help out on how to add gitter badge?
[2017-08-09 15:11:13] <wg1j> Hi guys, how can i delete a conversation with people
[2017-08-09 15:12:26] <TimEvens> Topics and faqs didn't have any details on this problem.  I'm new to gitter so I of course made the mistake of adding a long display name for my new community.  My community URL name is short and fine but my problem is that I used too long of a display name for Gitter to display rooms correctly in the rooms list for iOS.   The browser works okay because it lists the community first, then each room under that. It's different in the iOS app.  It displays <community **display** name>/<room name>. In my case my community display name is too long so it truncates the listing.  This is a bad user experience because all rooms have the same name of <community display name... since it doesn't fit all characters.  The user has to trial and error click all rooms to expand the name.   A simple fix for me would be if I can change my communitydisplay nameto match the short url name.   You can see this problem with gitter.im/snas.    Is it possible for me to change the community display name to match my URL name?
[2017-08-09 17:38:44] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @Davy-FYou can track [<-LINK->]

[2017-08-09 17:40:36] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @wg1jYou can't delete a one to one conversation. You can hide the room though,
[2017-08-09 17:40:59] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @TimEvensSend a message tosupport@gitter.imwith your request to change the display name
[2017-08-09 17:55:15] <graywolf> ok, this might be stupid question but how can I turn off emoticons? I cannot find it and it's hard to believe it's not possible

[2017-08-09 17:57:33] <graywolf> hm.. awesome.. thanks for link, will follow the issue

[2017-08-11 22:50:46] <johnmcdowell> hi-- in slack there's a way to message myself-- I use it to keep little notes for myself, or to test how markdown will format before sending to a large group. Does gitter support something like this?
[2017-08-12 03:50:49] <potopowitz_twitter> Hi...im in some serious help...my page refreshed and I've lost my account...i have some information...im so new to this and I'm afraid I've lost access...bill
[2017-08-12 03:51:34] <potopowitz_twitter> I was advised to seek out your help in chat...
[2017-08-12 17:21:54] <InternetUnexplorer> potopowitz_twitter: What do you mean by "I've lost my account"?
[2017-08-12 17:22:41] <InternetUnexplorer> johnmcdowell: I don't think there is support for this at the moment, unfortunately. Feel free to open an issue on GitLab if you think it should be added.
[2017-08-12 17:23:17] <InternetUnexplorer> hi all my github login  seem to have been disconnected from the FCC interface. How do I reconnect back please?@tundeiness FCC questions should be asked in the FCC room; this room is for Gitter support only.
[2017-08-13 05:53:55] <ShalokShalom> hi there
[2017-08-13 05:54:10] <ShalokShalom> is there a method to upload pictures from my computer?
[2017-08-13 05:54:19] <ShalokShalom> when will the source code released?
[2017-08-13 15:58:20] <InternetUnexplorer> @ShalokShalom You can upload images a few ways:Drag the image into your browser window
Paste a link to the image
Use markdown to embed the imageThe source code is available online here.
[2017-08-13 16:01:59] <codedsun> Hello,anyone could help me out regarding gitter api? who have worked previously on this or have a good knowledge of APIs
[2017-08-13 21:39:33] <danamlewis> When asking via a support conversation about the ability to block individuals from private messaging another user, I was pointed to a 2+ year old issue. I've found dozens of requests for this across various repo's and issue logging places. This is very badly needed. Can anyone from Gittter give an update as to whether this issue is ever going to be addressed, to protect users from abusive private conversations?
[2017-08-13 21:57:11] <serapath> MadLittleMods: one question. I just checked an issue i created 9 months ago [<-LINK->] I see there are a lot of open issues. How is gitter deciding what to push and what not? How much budget is there? I'm just curious how all this works :-) ...It should not be too hard to get into it and maybe even start making some pull requests to solve certain open issues...
[2017-08-13 21:57:40] <serapath> I also read, that gitlab bought gitter. what does that mean for development?
[2017-08-14 07:06:11] <photis>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-08-14 07:06:46] <photis> Tarocco: A bit late maybe, but I can see them fine (on MacOS 10.12.6)
[2017-08-14 07:07:05] <Tarocco> oriste: ok
[2017-08-14 07:08:05] <Tarocco> good to know
[2017-08-14 12:40:31] <cbj4074> @danamlewis @serapath Everything I've read indicates that basic issue resolution has been back-burnered for stability and scalability. With the GitLab acquisition, the code-base is being open-sourced, so hopefully we'll be able to start submitting PRs for some issues in the near future. Addressing other issues will still require access to infrastructure and other resources that unprivileged end-users do not have, and so we will still be dependent, to some extent, on GitLab to step in.More info at http://blog.gitter.im/2017/03/15/gitter-gitlab-acquisition/
[2017-08-14 12:41:09] <cbj4074> That said, I have seen, on several occasions, acknowledgement that blocking, muting, etc. are badly needed.
[2017-08-14 12:41:16] <cbj4074> (from Gitter staff members)
[2017-08-14 12:41:56] <cbj4074> The gist seems to be that the only priority at the moment is transitioning everything to GitLab. Once that's done and things are running smoothly, I have to assume that we'll see some action.
[2017-08-14 12:43:49] <cbj4074> danamlewis: Regarding your specific question, I know it's not "blocking", but you can still click the...on a conversation and chooseHide, right?
[2017-08-14 16:22:55] <tundeiness> InternetUnexplorer: errrm this issue isn't an FCC issue. I can't access gitter help in my FCC page and someone said i need to do something on my github and FCC interface to get the gitter help back on my FCC page. The thing is I don't know how to go about it. So this is also an open call to everyone who can help to please show me how to get gitter help back on my FCC page. Thank you.
[2017-08-14 17:12:57] <InternetUnexplorer> D3V4N5H: Please use gitterHQ/sandbox for testing.
[2017-08-14 17:17:06] <InternetUnexplorer> tundeiness: Please elaborate then, because what you are describing sounds like an FCC issue.
[2017-08-15 05:46:34] <BrianMuwonge> Hello Everyone, It's Brian here. Still new on Gitter and been off due to varioud obligation. I want to resume my code trials and don't know how to start. Please advise.
[2017-08-15 14:16:48] <YamiGoldenDarkness> hello i`m new from where i can take l2j h5 datapack ?? i find just freya :(
[2017-08-15 15:51:35] <tundeiness> InternetUnexplorer: (I wish i can screen grab this) actually what I want restored back in my FCC page/interface is the Help tab which directly links me to gitter rooms. Now I dont have the "help"  tab/button in my page anymore and I would like to have it back. someone said it has to do with my FCC page and github account. Even if that's the issue I still don't know how to go about it.
[2017-08-15 17:16:38] <cbj4074> tundeiness: Wouldn't it make a lot more sense to ask in the freecodecamp room?
[2017-08-15 18:48:21] <jethrogb> Is creating private rooms broken from the web UI?
[2017-08-15 18:48:36] <jethrogb> or public rooms for that matter
[2017-08-15 18:48:41] <jethrogb> when I click create nothing happens
[2017-08-15 18:48:48] <jethrogb> tried both firefox and chromium
[2017-08-15 19:45:24] <MadLittleMods> @jethrogb Do you see any errors in the console? What does the network request look like?What room are you trying to create? (associated with what?)
[2017-08-15 19:50:15] <jethrogb> TypeError: e is undefined[Learn More] 6.chunk.js:2:2207TypeError: t is undefined[Learn More]  6.chunk.js:2:4126Error: A group needs to be selected in order to create a room  6.chunk.js:1:31747TypeError: t is undefined[Learn More]
[2017-08-15 19:50:50] <jethrogb> I DMed you the room name
[2017-08-15 19:53:28] <jethrogb> MadLittleMods: ok the problem was that I wasn't a community administrator
[2017-08-15 19:53:35] <jethrogb> even though I was added as one
[2017-08-15 19:53:47] <jethrogb> anyway, there is still a UI bug
[2017-08-15 19:54:12] <jethrogb> if you're in a room in some community that you're not an admin in, and then click "Add a room", it will by default select the current community, which you don't have permissions in
[2017-08-15 20:11:32] <MadLittleMods> @jethrogb Thanks for the explanation.

[2017-08-16 02:22:36] <Da_Magz_twitter> Hi! I'm using twitter to sign in but I cannot change/add a profile picture and it hasn't pulled my twitter picture in (it's been 2 weeks like this). Thanks!
[2017-08-16 02:25:17] <Da_Magz_twitter> I've installed/reinstalled the app, used online browser, logged in and out multiple times
[2017-08-16 03:20:35] <MadLittleMods> Da_Magz_twitter: Usually a sign out and sign back in fixes this type of thing. I manually updated your avatar
[2017-08-16 03:22:25] <Da_Magz_twitter> MadLittleMods: THANK YOU so much!!!
[2017-08-16 03:22:33] <Da_Magz_twitter> I'm a real person now!

[2017-08-16 03:29:24] <hmatt1> Will gitter ever support bot users and outgoing webhooks?
[2017-08-16 03:36:18] <MadLittleMods> @hmatt1 Do you mean impersonating another user? You can track https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/1076I am not aware of an issue for outgoing webhook support, mind creating one? https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues
[2017-08-16 04:05:29] <hmatt1> Thanks@MadLittleMods, I added an issue here: [<-LINK->] I'm pretty new to gitter so let me know if I should add more detail

[2017-08-16 09:57:15] <photis> Is there some way to have Gitter (for iOS) position the messages in such a way that the top message is the first unread one? Now I have to scroll up to find the last read message and see all the unread ones in reverse order. A weebit inconvenient for following a thread.
[2017-08-16 13:51:48] <ShalokShalom> oriste: +1
[2017-08-16 15:51:34] <InternetUnexplorer> tundeiness: That is a FreeCodeCamp issue.

[2017-08-16 16:51:23] <Plazmaz>  [<-LINK->] <groupname> returns an error 409 in the console
[2017-08-16 16:51:42] <Plazmaz> whereas [<-LINK->] <groupname> is not found
[2017-08-16 17:57:23] <MadLittleMods> Plazmaz: It probably already exists on GitHub and needs to be associated first in order to create. See the "do you want to start a community for one of your github projects?" link on the first community create step
[2017-08-17 07:41:28] <accidentannie> Unable to "create your own" via mobile. Continues to have me sign in.

[2017-08-17 17:19:29] <tcsiwula_twitter> i cant sign out of my mac gitter app, my account has spawned a second one associated with my twitter login. ..
[2017-08-17 18:11:19] <accidentannie> Sure can! Thanks. I fixed it by using the app to sign up, but still will post the issue!
[2017-08-17 18:13:41] <accidentannie> Seems the issue was already posted! Thank you! Love this app by the way. So responsive and perfect for communicating with Co workers and students too!
[2017-08-17 19:17:38] <Plazmaz> MadLittleMods: that's what I was trying to do. It didn't work
[2017-08-17 19:19:09] <Plazmaz> Is it because I'm not the owner of the project maybe? I have contributor access.
[2017-08-17 21:09:10] <ShalokShalom> MadLittleMods: thanks a lot
[2017-08-18 10:18:08] <jcubic> Hi, are push notifications in gitter webapp send from service worker or from normal page?

[2017-08-22 07:20:45] <docgunthrop> Hello, had a question about whether issue [<-ISSUE->] was still being worked on
[2017-08-22 12:15:29] <cbj4074> docgunthrop: I don't think anything is being worked on at the moment.
[2017-08-22 12:15:45] <cbj4074> (until transition to GitLab is complete)
[2017-08-22 13:51:55] <tribals> Hi folks. I can't understand how "Alt+Click" intended to work: when I clicking on message's datetime with Alt pressed, nothing is happen.
[2017-08-22 13:53:07] <cbj4074> Hmm, works for me... it inserts a reference into the input field.
[2017-08-22 13:59:13] <tribals> What is your OS, browser? Do you use any extensions (notably any related to mouse gestures)?
[2017-08-22 14:03:34] <curtiscarlson> Can you log out of this app?  Ive tried several times but I still get notifications in the middl of the night.
[2017-08-22 14:03:59] <tribals> Me?
[2017-08-22 14:13:45] <docgunthrop> cbj4074: thanks, Ben
[2017-08-22 14:14:40] <cbj4074> tribals: Windows 7 x64, using Desktop app

[2017-08-23 00:26:11] <weitzhandler> I don't know if this is the right place, I'm trying to achieve bold word in code + syntax highlighting.Now, bold word in code is achieved by writing<pre>var i = <b>"Hello world"</b>;</pre>, which when rendered in GH  shows"Hello world"as bold within the code-snippet.But then it looses the syntax highlighting. How do I enable both? Can I set the language in thecodetag? Add a style? Anything? Any other place to ask this question?
[2017-08-23 00:30:11] <InternetUnexplorer> weitzhandler: Not the right place. You most likely wantgitterHQ/developers.

[2017-08-24 16:23:35] <joshuaptfan> Do chat messages expire?
[2017-08-24 16:37:56] <MadLittleMods> joshuaptfan: no, they are always available in the archives
[2017-08-24 16:38:11] <joshuaptfan> thanks
[2017-08-24 17:31:12] <joshuaptfan> I created an organization, then deleted all rooms linked to it. When I click on the organization on the left sidebar, it asks me to create a room, but the button does nothing. I've tried restarting the browser and both Chrome and Firefox.
[2017-08-24 17:33:10] <joshuaptfan> Ok, I was able to make a room using the "Add a room" button.
[2017-08-24 17:33:32] <joshuaptfan> Still, that dialog is broken.
[2017-08-24 17:36:14] <joshuaptfan> Also, in Firefox 55, the left menu bar has an unscrollable scrollbar in the empty space. It needs CSS "overflow: hidden;".
[2017-08-24 17:39:52] <cbj4074> I would just open issues for these things, provided none exist already.
[2017-08-24 19:37:03] <1l2p> I am slightly embarassed to ask this, but where is the log-out (switch accounts) button in the Gitter OSX desktop client? I can’t seem to find it.
[2017-08-24 19:42:55] <cbj4074> I'm on Windows, but here, it's  under theGitterapplication menu, at top-left. It's not under the equivalent menu on the Mac?
[2017-08-24 19:43:01] <cbj4074> 1l2p: ^
[2017-08-24 19:46:22] <1l2p> Do you mean the Gitter logo in the top left corner? It doesn’t open a menu (neither hover nor click) for me. I’ll try restarting the client, maybe something went wrong. Brb. I run Version 1.177 (1.177) which seems to be the latest.
[2017-08-24 19:46:33] <1l2p> Also, thanks@cbj4074for the quick reply!
[2017-08-24 19:48:15] <1l2p> No, restart didn’t help …
[2017-08-24 19:51:49] <1l2p> In the browser interface it works. I can left-click on my avatar (top-right) which opens a menu that includes a “Sign Out" option. In the Desktop client however the only menu items are “Allow Private Repo Access”, “Home”, “Toggle Dark Theme” …
[2017-08-24 19:53:07] <cbj4074> Doesn't Mac OS have a dedicated menu for the active/focused application? It's just to the right of the "Apple Menu".
[2017-08-24 19:53:07] <1l2p> Is the browser the recommended interface for Gitter on Mac (rather than OSX desktop client)?
[2017-08-24 19:54:07] <cbj4074> They are effectively identical. The desktop app is just a Chromium-based wrapper for the service you get in any browser.
[2017-08-24 19:54:46] <cbj4074> The menu I'm referring to is this one:
[2017-08-24 19:54:54] <cbj4074>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-08-24 19:55:02] <cbj4074> Doesn't that sayGitterwhen you're in the desktop app?
[2017-08-24 19:55:28] <1l2p> cbj4074: yes each application has a dedicated menu, but for Gitter that menu does not include a Log Out option either. i’ll see if I can figure out how to post a screenshot.
[2017-08-24 19:56:10] <cbj4074> Huh, okay, gotcha. There are a number of other handy menu items under there on Windows, such as Gitter Next, Developer Tools, Sign Out...
[2017-08-24 19:56:19] <1l2p>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-08-24 19:56:58] <cbj4074> No kidding! You raise a great question, then. :D
[2017-08-24 19:57:34] <1l2p> Ha. It seems there must be an obvious answer.
[2017-08-24 19:57:49] <cbj4074> Right?! Hopefully someone on a Mac will come along any moment...
[2017-08-24 19:58:04] <1l2p> Yes, thanks for trying to help!
[2017-08-24 19:58:46] <OptikWebCreative> 1l2p: I’d never noticed that - but when I close the Gitter App, i dont get notifications
[2017-08-24 21:34:39] <joshuaptfan> Wow, the menu scroll bar bug was reported 9 months ago >_< [<-LINK->] 
[2017-08-24 21:38:12] <joshuaptfan> I guess it shows the prevalence of Chrome since the bug is in your face on any browser except Chrome
[2017-08-24 21:41:19] <joshuaptfan> and Safari
[2017-08-24 21:41:22] <Tarocco> I can confirm that the scroll bar is there on Firefox

[2017-08-26 01:23:15] <sharikovvladislav> What will be if I click collapse?
[2017-08-26 01:23:26] <sharikovvladislav> They become hidden for me but what about others?
[2017-08-26 01:38:27] <MadLittleMods> sharikovvladislav: It just collapses for yourself

[2017-08-28 16:40:23] <teenmatchml_twitter> Does the moderator get money?
[2017-08-28 16:47:52] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @teenmatchml_twitterI work at GitLab. Being an admin/moderator of a room doesn't have any direct monetary incentive
[2017-08-28 16:50:19] <puremourning> MadLittleMods: thanks a lot!
[2017-08-28 16:51:34] <puremourning> Also thanks for gitlab.
[2017-08-28 16:51:40] <puremourning> :d
[2017-08-29 14:45:24] <mrosset> hi how do I get a new password with [<-LINK->] it just keeps giving me the same one. I need a new password
[2017-08-29 15:31:17] <1l2p> thank you@MadLittleMods- it’ seems obvious once you know! (I hadn’t even noticed it placed an icon in the taskbar).
[2017-08-29 15:33:03] <1l2p> I have noticed that there is a lot mor activity in the Gitlab repo for the webapp compared to the desktop clients. Is that a strategic decision by the dev team to prioritize the web app (or just user preference)?
[2017-08-29 15:36:39] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @mrossetThere isn't a way to refresh the token in the UI. I have removed the token and you should be able to generate another one by going to [<-LINK->] again
[2017-08-29 15:37:08] <mrosset> MadLittleMods: thank you
[2017-08-29 15:38:05] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @1l2pThe recent batch of activity was just moving some issues around. The desktop app is getting some updates and is currently waiting on a webapp release. The desktop app is a hybrid setup and uses the webapp
[2017-08-29 21:43:12] <TheDiamondYT1> MadLittleMods: Still not open-sourced the Android app, i see.
[2017-08-30 15:02:53] <ronnyek> Is there any possibility of ever getting an ignore feature? I down own a channel, and have one user constantly trying to troll me for whatever reason, and apparently the people that have the power to do so havent found the need to ban this user yet. Rather than me get angry and negatively affect rest of channel, I'd really really just like to be able to ignore this person
[2017-08-30 16:41:38] <TheDiamondYT1> Rutwik28: This chat is for Gitteronly
[2017-08-30 17:41:11] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @ronnyekYou can track [<-LINK->] 
[2017-08-30 23:47:51] <arekkusu> Hi ! Recently started using Gitter with both public and private chatroom. In the Android client I can not find any hint as to wether a chatroom is public or not
[2017-08-30 23:53:21] <arekkusu> Apparently a padlock is shown on the other client. Seems like an important oversight. Or am I missing something?
[2017-08-31 00:59:46] <MadLittleMods> arekkusu: Looks like there isn't a way to tell atm, mind creating an issue? [<-LINK->] 
[2017-08-31 01:00:40] <arekkusu> Sure will try to do it later today. Thanks
[2017-08-31 11:54:47] <sjrd> Hello. Is it possible to "archive" a Gitter room? i.e., turn it into a read-only mode but without deleting it. Related question: is it possible torenamea Gitter room, preserving its chat history/members/etc.
[2017-08-31 11:55:29] <sjrd> I searched the docs and the Web quite a bit, but couldn't find anything on the topic.
[2017-08-31 11:56:09] <sjrd> The closest I found was [<-LINK->] , but in this case the repo is still the same, I just want to rename a sub-room attached to that repo.
[2017-08-31 12:33:25] <arekkusu> Reported the issue::// [<-LINK->] 
[2017-08-31 12:33:35] <arekkusu>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-08-31 14:33:43] <cloorc> It seems can not remove an existing community, may I?
[2017-08-31 15:47:47] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @sjrdThere isn't a way to make a room read-only. You can follow those same docs if you want a room renamed though

[2017-09-01 09:43:19] <ShalokShalom> i like to receive notifications with the OCD, is this possible?
[2017-09-01 09:46:25] <ShalokShalom> hnn, seems like there is an issue here on Chrome, i enable the notification of the desktop OSD notification and do not receive them
[2017-09-01 13:10:11] <man15h> This is cool though

[2017-09-02 18:28:53] <InternetUnexplorer> WaterYourRoots: Not on topic here; this room is for Gitter support only.
[2017-09-02 18:41:20] <WaterYourRoots> InternetUnexplorer: any room on gitter meant for a question liket this?

[2017-09-03 18:18:57] <scrthq> Send to Gitter now available! Hey Gitterino's! I just published a Visual Studio Code extension to send snippets, files or messages directly from Code to the Gitter room or One to One conversation of your choice! This FYI was posted using the extension itself! Feel free to check it out! You can find it by...Searching for Gitter in the extensions pane in Code (it's currently the only one)

[2017-09-05 01:41:31] <lijinma> Hi there, does the gitter community have the member upper limit?
[2017-09-05 01:41:44] <lijinma> InternetUnexplorer: 
[2017-09-05 01:42:03] <lijinma> I mean the member number.
[2017-09-05 01:58:46] <InternetUnexplorer> There is no limit on the number of people who can be in a room,@lijinma.
[2017-09-05 02:08:00] <lijinma> thanks
[2017-09-05 17:33:46] <serapath> InternetUnexplorer: Is there any chance this issue will be worked on in the near future? [<-LINK->] 
[2017-09-05 18:24:52] <MadLittleMods> serapath: Not likely. You can take a stab at it now that the webapp is open source though, [<-LINK->] 
[2017-09-06 18:56:45] <Dikkeboktor> Why did you ban my matrixbot?
[2017-09-06 19:05:16] <InternetUnexplorer> Dikkeboktor: It was posting a bunch of unrelated links. Please PM me if you would like to discuss.
[2017-09-06 19:19:25] <Dikkeboktor> Unrelated links?
[2017-09-06 19:32:54] <InternetUnexplorer> Dikkeboktor: Please PM me if you would like to discuss, so we don't flood the public support room with messages.
[2017-09-06 22:15:36] <winsys11> um I looked around but couldnt find an answer.... how do I "univite" someone? I accidentally invited the wrong person..... thanks
[2017-09-06 22:26:10] <InternetUnexplorer> winsys11: Are you referring to the "Add people to this room" feature?
[2017-09-06 22:31:14] <MadLittleMods> winsys11: You can remove them from the room./remove, etc
[2017-09-06 23:33:02] <winsys11> so they need to accept first, yes?
[2017-09-06 23:47:29] <InternetUnexplorer> It seems that they're actually added immediately,@winsys11.
[2017-09-06 23:48:04] <winsys11> ok, i appreciate your help, but I dont undertand. what does /remove mean?
[2017-09-07 13:58:24] <Databugecho> Hi everyone
[2017-09-07 13:59:09] <Databugecho> I have a question about this chat...What are brownie points?
[2017-09-07 14:04:38] <InternetUnexplorer> Databugecho: They're not a thing here. Perhaps you meant to ask in the FreeCodeCamp room?
[2017-09-07 14:05:03] <Databugecho> uh yes sorry 
[2017-09-07 22:52:23] <MikeGrace> Hello! Just found Gitter and it looks great. I looked through the website and this channel's topics but couldn't find anything on how I can expect Gitter to last long term with the service being free and a lack of advertising.  Anyone know what the plans are? Someone has to pay for it  right?
[2017-09-07 23:42:25] <nafg> MikeGrace: I think you can get private rooms for $$. Anyway now it's owned by Gitlab
[2017-09-07 23:44:45] <MadLittleMods> MikeGrace: @nafgThere are no costs or restrictions for Gitter users anymore. [<-LINK->] is paying for server costs, etc
[2017-09-07 23:45:58] <nafg> Ah, I didn't realize that changed
[2017-09-07 23:46:29] <nafg> MadLittleMods: what does gitlab benefit from it? Are they going to package it instead of mattermost?
[2017-09-07 23:46:44] <nafg> They haven't even put branding on it ;)
[2017-09-07 23:48:21] <MadLittleMods> @nafg You can read more here https://about.gitlab.com/2017/03/15/gitter-acquisition/GitLab is slowly being integrated in at the moment (like signing in and issue decorations)
[2017-09-07 23:52:07] <nafg> MadLittleMods: is there any reason not to use gitter for an invite-only community with a modest amount of traffic (too much for free slack plan)?
[2017-09-07 23:54:40] <MadLittleMods> nafg: If you like the platform then it should suit your needs. We have several large communities already and there aren't any restrictions
[2017-09-07 23:55:14] <nafg> Nice, thanks :)
[2017-09-09 04:40:51] <harindu95> can anyone help me to connect using irc??

[2017-09-11 01:31:47] <lostllama> Hi, how do I get rid of this stupid green tab at the top of my screen that says "NEXT"? It's extremely frustrating to have it constantly visible.
[2017-09-11 01:38:07] <MadLittleMods> lostllama: Go back to "Current", [<-LINK->] 
[2017-09-11 01:39:57] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @mariobehlingIt needs to be associated with the GitHub repo in order to create a room with that name. If it isn't appearing in the typeahead or auto-associating, you probably need to grant private repo scope on that org, [<-LINK->] 
[2017-09-11 01:40:01] <lostllama> Thanks. Does that mean I can't use the toggleable features on the "Next" page anymore?
[2017-09-11 01:41:39] <MadLittleMods> lostllama: They should be separate
[2017-09-11 01:41:49] <lostllama> Oh, ok. I didn't understand that. Thanks :)

[2017-09-11 13:22:19] <dabear> Hi. I see blog posts about an open source version of gitter. However, I can't find any references to source code or downloads. Is that available anywhere?
[2017-09-11 14:25:58] <InternetUnexplorer> dabear: The source code is available [<-LINK->] .
[2017-09-11 14:29:46] <dabear> thx

[2017-09-11 19:13:11] <MadLittleMods> mr-yadav235: Better to ask your question right away instead of waiting for a introduction reply. Don't ask to ask, just ask
[2017-09-11 19:24:53] <prisma-kwell> i was wondering is there a way to change a group name
[2017-09-11 19:55:26] <MadLittleMods> prisma-kwell: There isn't a way to change it in the UI. You can emailsupport@gitter.imwith a link to the community and your desired new name. Please make your GitHub org membership public if the community is associated with one
[2017-09-11 19:56:16] <prisma-kwell> ok thank you
[2017-09-11 21:26:20] <benqxf> Hello. Sorry to  ask, as this has been asked before but cannot find fix:  is there a way to increase/decrease font size  in Gitter for windows app?  went to developer Tools. no luck. Thnx

[2017-09-12 18:23:38] <treyharris> On the iOS app, the return key always composes a newline. Opt-return, shift-return, ctrl-return, and command-return also all do the same. There seems to be no "Compose Mode" toggle in the app. How do I send other than by tapping "Send" on the screen?
[2017-09-12 18:38:37] <InternetUnexplorer> I'm having the opposite problem; there seems to be no way to compose a newline on Android.
[2017-09-12 19:59:55] <treyharris> InternetUnexplorer: Try Chrome; it seems to be fully-functioning (including compose vs. message mode) on iOS. My Android's a phone and it's a pain to hook up a physical keyboard or I'd try it.
[2017-09-12 20:00:50] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @treyharrisI'm not an iOS user, but I think the dedicated "Send" button is the only way
[2017-09-12 20:00:56] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @InternetUnexplorerYou can track [<-LINK->] 
[2017-09-12 20:01:24] <MadLittleMods> Depending on your device, mobile Chrome will show the toggles
[2017-09-13 13:58:41] <cupsadarius> Hi guys, I did something stupid, by mistake i revoked gitter access to github and I lost access to a community. Is this by any means recoverable ?
[2017-09-13 14:49:27] <MadLittleMods> cupsadarius: You can sign out and sign back in to Gitter to get prompted again to grant access
[2017-09-13 16:41:03] <cupsadarius> @MadLittleModsI did but i still can't do anything, the community no longer appears in my list
[2017-09-13 16:42:16] <cupsadarius> Ok this is weird, I logged in from the mobile app and I can see it
[2017-09-13 16:42:25] <cupsadarius> Thanks anyway
[2017-09-14 02:30:19] <PlutoCA> Guys, ask, how to use the phone to open the computer, the local HTML file, already in the same LAN
[2017-09-14 11:23:18] <Arjuna144> Hi Guys,Just a thought: It would be awesome to access ALL the history of a chat and/or chatroom. This scrolling and AJAX-Reloading of History is really bad if a chat contains very good resources and help that has accumulated over time!
[2017-09-14 11:23:33] <Arjuna144> Or is there already a way to get the full history of a chat?

[2017-09-14 19:55:06] <InternetUnexplorer> AdviZzzor: ?
[2017-09-14 19:56:31] <cbj4074> Might be asking if conversations can be threaded... I've seen other people ask. I think Slack and/or some other apps have threading.
[2017-09-17 03:51:40] <nafg> Slack has limited (more like comments on a message)
[2017-09-17 19:12:47] <luminosidade_twitter> what is the economic model of gitter? I can't find it anywhere. Is there any pro accounts or something? i suppose that money is needed for the servers for example..
[2017-09-17 19:54:59] <nafg> luminosidade_twitter: they used to be their own company and charged for private rooms but then gitlab bought them and made it completely free. They plan to integrate it more with gitlab.
[2017-09-17 22:23:53] <luminosidade_twitter> nafg: thanks!!!
[2017-09-18 17:06:40] <portenez> I cannot paste an image into gitter from the macos app, is this a known issue? or is it me?
[2017-09-18 17:07:27] <MadLittleMods> portenez: See [<-LINK->] 
[2017-09-18 17:10:13] <portenez> cool, thanks
[2017-09-18 20:47:04] <jllouis> Hi, there I have a question. My bitbucket events aren't being posted to my gitter community despite enabling the integration.
[2017-09-18 20:47:10] <jllouis> Am I the only one having this issue?
[2017-09-18 21:31:11] <MadLittleMods> @jllouis I don't see any recent reports.There is this outstanding issue, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/1309
[2017-09-18 21:39:06] <jllouis> MadLittleMods: Thanks for the reference
[2017-09-19 13:23:43] <pnkfelix> I have a question: Message history is supposed to be unlimited, but I don't see scrollback before Sept 18 20:48 in a room. Nor does a colleague of mine. But another participant sees messages going back to Sept 12.
[2017-09-19 13:23:54] <pnkfelix> This is regarding room [<-LINK->] 
[2017-09-19 13:24:46] <pnkfelix> So... do I need to file a bug? Or is there some reasonable explanation that support can find by looking in gitter's internal logs?
[2017-09-19 13:32:22] <pnkfelix> Oh, correction: All participants are only able to scroll back to Sept 18 20:48
[2017-09-19 13:32:49] <pnkfelix> (but it seems clear from context that there were almost certainly messages before that point? Is there some way that someone could have cleared the history?)
[2017-09-19 16:45:20] <ShubhamBadal_twitter> Help me:I today signed up on the web app using twitter. Now I can't find how to connect my github account too. Can't join many rooms as they allow only Github users. How do I connect github with my new gitter account?
[2017-09-19 16:53:49] <cbj4074> ShubhamBadal_twitter: Sign out of Gitter, and this time, sign-in with your GitHub credentials.
[2017-09-19 16:53:58] <cbj4074> (not your Twitter credentials)
[2017-09-19 17:10:06] <ShubhamBadal_twitter> cbj4074: It will connect my github to this account if my github account has the same email id. Otherwise it will result in two separate gitter accounts. Am I right?
[2017-09-19 18:12:15] <cbj4074> ShubhamBadal_twitter: I have to assume so.
[2017-09-19 18:13:03] <cbj4074> Let me correct that: I think they are two "separate accounts", regardless of whether you use the same email address for Twitter and GitHub, but I cannot say with certainty (I'm just another user).
[2017-09-19 18:57:06] <ShubhamBadal_twitter> @cbj4074 That's what my concern is. I have got data and activity in this account and I'll not want a completely new account to be created. Most apps have a 'connect apps' option in settings which I don't find in Gitter. I don't see any settings section itself. I am using the web app.So, I'll wait for a response from someone in the Gitter team. Thanks for your reply.
[2017-09-19 19:47:04] <cbj4074> Gotcha, that is entirely reasonable. Curious what they say. 
[2017-09-19 20:47:30] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @ShubhamBadal_twitter@cbj4074They will be two separate accounts. There isn't a way to connect another OAuth provider at the moment
[2017-09-19 20:52:33] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @pnkfelixAny admin can delete messages in a room. I don't see any older messages from the archive, [<-LINK->] or in the raw ElasticSearch index from people chatting at that time
[2017-09-20 09:30:16] <pnkfelix> MadLittleMods: thanks for the response. Maybe we're just wrong about there being earlier conversations in the room.
[2017-09-20 10:06:31] <silvanheller> Is there a way change join rights for a room after creating it? We have a room that is currently invite-only, but would like to make it public.
[2017-09-20 16:22:06] <MadLittleMods> silvanheller: There isn't a way to change the member permissions/security yet. You can emailsupport@gitter.imwith a link to the room and the desired permissions/security. If the room is connected with a repo under an org, make sure your GitHub org membership is public.
[2017-09-20 17:29:57] <georgewsinger> How does one post an inline-image of GitHub code. Perhaps it GitHub gists shown inline. I'm not talking about [<-CODE->] But it is formatted in the same way as on a GitHub page.
[2017-09-20 17:30:19] <georgewsinger> I've seen them inline on many Gitter's but can pin down how to post one myself 
[2017-09-20 17:48:54] <cbj4074> georgewsinger: Yes, I believe you're referring to inline Gists.
[2017-09-20 17:49:41] <MadLittleMods> georgewsinger: To add onto what@cbj4074mentioned, just paste a link to a gist
[2017-09-20 18:00:17] <georgewsinger> If I'm an admin of a Gitter room,  is there any way for me to edit posts after 5 min? Or give people the ability to do that?
[2017-09-20 18:20:11] <MadLittleMods> georgewsinger: No, you can only delete a message after the 5 minute window
[2017-09-20 19:47:54] <georgewsinger> That's quite unfortunate :(
[2017-09-20 19:56:16] <cbj4074> (and a bit surprising... what if somebody is spamming/abusing?)
[2017-09-20 21:12:29] <MadLittleMods> cbj4074: There is some automatic detection of spam. As an admin, you can ban the user and delete their messages. You can emailsupport@gitter.imwith the trouble username and permalinks. In terms of development, there is also a PR in the old private repo for reporting messages and checking for low quality messages
[2017-09-20 21:14:38] <cbj4074> MadLittleMods: Oh, okay,@georgewsingerdid say, "If I'm an admin of a Gitter room" in   [<-LINK->] 
[2017-09-20 21:16:34] <MadLittleMods> cbj4074: Both of my responses still seem valid  You can't edit, only delete after 5 minutes
[2017-09-20 21:19:01] <cbj4074> MadLittleMods: Ah! Good call! My apologies... I thought he was asking if he could delete. My bad! Thanks for clarifying. 
[2017-09-20 21:19:26] <cbj4074> The current behavior actually makes a lot more sense in light of your explanation.
[2017-09-20 22:22:08] <georgewsinger> Editing after 5 minutes makes typo correction in code snippets tremendously easier. Slack has historical editing past 5 minutes that I grew accustomed to.
[2017-09-20 22:54:15] <InternetUnexplorer> There used to be a 10(?) minute window where you could delete and edit, which was changed so that you could delete at any time.
[2017-09-20 22:54:53] <InternetUnexplorer> Perhaps the editing time limit could be removed to match this?
[2017-09-21 11:02:20] <Janisku7> have the client updated? as in recents Windows 10 Insider builds gitter desktop app dont show up even its show open in taskbar
[2017-09-21 14:52:34] <MadLittleMods> Janisku7: There haven't been any recent updates to the desktop client. Do you see Gitter running in the tray (bottom-right)?
[2017-09-21 14:53:40] <Janisku7> yeah but i cant see the client so i write this from the browser
[2017-09-21 14:54:38] <MadLittleMods> Janisku7: Does the client open if you click on the tray icon or right-click and click a room?
[2017-09-21 14:55:27] <Janisku7> If i click the tray icon it show in the taskbar and if i hover it show in the preview window but nothing else
[2017-09-21 14:58:47] <Janisku7> I just tweeted about it
[2017-09-21 15:46:27] <MadLittleMods> Janisku7: What happens if you right-click on the aero-window and "Maximize"?
[2017-09-21 16:58:34] <MadLittleMods> Janisku7: You can also try these instructions here, [<-LINK->] 
[2017-09-21 17:14:44] <Janisku7> nope not work
[2017-09-21 17:17:16] <MadLittleMods> @Janisku7 I don't have any further steps to try if you already ran through the instructions linked.Did it previously work? Did you just update Windows and now it is not working? We don't necessarily support the bleeding edge Windows insider builds that may have bugs
[2017-09-22 07:28:31] <trusso9> this is going to sound stupid but … I’m not sure how to log out of the mac app
[2017-09-22 07:32:22] <trusso9> nevermind
[2017-09-22 18:53:16] <Nolaan> Hey guys where to find info about gitter/gitlab integration? I'm so looking forward to use it!
[2017-09-23 00:46:22] <georgewsinger> Is there a way to connect to IRC Freenode using Gitter?
[2017-09-23 00:46:39] <georgewsinger> This would allow you to use Gitter's syntax highlighting, markdown, and so forth while in IRC chat rooms
[2017-09-23 09:24:25] <Janisku7> MadLittleMods: yeah it worked fine previously and i have used over 2 years insider builds but near to fall creators update window not showing even node-webkit shows in the startup
[2017-09-23 12:58:24] <ChaitanyaChavda_twitter> Hello
[2017-09-24 20:41:51] <kaechle_twitter> Hey all. I can’t seem to figure out how to log out of the desktop version of gitter for macos. I’m trying to switch from my twitter to my github login. Help?
[2017-09-24 21:25:25] <InternetUnexplorer> kaechle_twitter:  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-09-24 21:59:26] <kaechle> InternetUnexplorer: 
[2017-09-25 20:30:58] <Bradcomp> Hello! Are there any requirements to adding a person to a room associated with a private github organization? They are already a member of the org on github, just need to get them gitter access...
[2017-09-25 20:34:30] <Bradcomp> It also logged me out when I attempted to add them to the room, which was weird. I had a few other members of the org try to add them, but the same thing happened...
[2017-09-26 04:48:39] <MadLittleMods> Bradcomp: When you add someone to a room, we check from their perspective whether they can join. They probably need to add private repo access to match the orgs granted scope or make their org membership public
[2017-09-26 06:50:18] <hshyt> hello
[2017-09-26 09:32:56] <stepky749> This is a group chat software?
[2017-09-26 09:33:20] <PadharaHitesh> i don't think so?
[2017-09-26 09:34:00] <stepky749> i am finding some software which can enable the group chat
[2017-09-26 09:34:11] <stepky749> is gitter the one i can use?
[2017-09-26 13:46:42] <dexter93> Hi there
[2017-09-26 13:56:16] <kbrock> What embedded plugin is gitter using?I noticed that speaker deck links don't support the?slide=33So I wanted to submit an issue/bug for them
[2017-09-26 14:29:07] <InternetUnexplorer> stepky749: Gitter is a web chat service for developers. If you want to enable group SMS, you will likely have to contact your cellular provider.
[2017-09-26 16:50:10] <vladshcherbin> Main chat window rendering is broken in Mac OS High Sierra. Font rendering is not the same as in sidebar. Adding-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;to main area helps.
[2017-09-26 17:00:14] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @kbrockWe currently use [<-LINK->] . We have also looked into [<-LINK->] 
[2017-09-26 17:02:17] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @VladShcherbinMind creating an issue? There is another macOS High Sierra issue with the Safari-backed desktop app, [<-LINK->] 
[2017-09-26 17:03:53] <vladshcherbin> MadLittleMods: yes, I checked issue tracker, this one is not the same. Can’t create a new issue as I don’t have a gitlab account, sorry.
[2017-09-26 18:28:32] <MadLittleMods> @VladShcherbin Can you provide a screenshot?I wasn't suggesting it was the same issue, just that it looks like High Sierra introduced some bugs
[2017-09-27 01:42:24] <vladshcherbin> MadLittleMods: here you go - [<-LINK->] . Font rendering is not the same in sidebar and main area. This is because-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;is applied to sidebar, but not the main area.
[2017-09-27 05:25:29] <MadLittleMods> VladShcherbin: What version of the Gitter desktop app are you using? I assume Gitter 3.1.0 based on the app title bar. I've created an issue you can track [<-LINK->] - Feel free to create a MR
[2017-09-27 06:37:18] <vladshcherbin> MadLittleMods: I tried 1.177 and 3.1.0, both have the same font rendering inconsistency. Thank you
[2017-09-27 18:14:02] <old-square-eyes> New to this channel. I test a mobile app and feedback to developers on Gitter Android. We are desperately wanting a share context for the Android Gitter app. Currently I have to take a screen shot on my phone, send it to my server, remote in with TeamViewer and fumble around downloading the image and dragging it on to a browser window... all through a tiny TeamViewer window.
[2017-09-27 18:15:06] <old-square-eyes> Ideally I'd take a screen shot, hit share and select Gitter, then the channel.
[2017-09-27 18:17:14] <old-square-eyes> Really, it's as agonising as it sounds. I'm testing on the go and exchanges are high frequency. We can't afford to be using a desktop session for image uploading.
[2017-09-27 18:18:13] <old-square-eyes> Also can I please request post search on Android? Currently I can only search users and channel names.
[2017-09-27 18:24:53] <InternetUnexplorer> The android app is lacking in a lot of features, and has several annoying bugs (such as messages automatically being posted when you rotate the screen/press the back button). Hopefully the source will be released soon so the community can work on it, as the Gitter team seems busy at the moment.
[2017-09-27 19:13:14] <old-square-eyes> One can only hope. Otherwise we have to look at alternatives.
[2017-09-27 23:20:46] <daegontaven> is it possible to rename a chat room ?  i want to rename my  chatroom name
[2017-09-28 16:56:13] <sudhirkhanger> Where can I find the code for the Gitter Android app?
[2017-09-28 17:45:39] <MadLittleMods> old-square-eyes: You can track [<-LINK->] (sorry for the labels missing atm)
[2017-09-28 17:45:58] <MadLittleMods> sudhirkhanger: The Gitter Android app is not open sourced yet
[2017-09-28 18:39:56] <old-square-eyes> MadLittleMods: thanks. This is two years old.
[2017-09-30 21:03:46] <agronholm> hey, I'm having trouble with github notifications
[2017-09-30 21:04:06] <agronholm> I've enabled github notifications in two repositories and travis, but I'm not getting anything in my room
[2017-09-30 21:04:29] <agronholm> I checked the "integrations" menu item and it shows that the events did arrive, but nothing is ever displayed
[2017-09-30 21:04:41] <agronholm> how can I debug this?
[2017-09-30 21:05:14] <agronholm> also, how do I authorize gitter for my organization?
[2017-09-30 21:05:29] <agronholm> I can't get it to request access so I could approve it
[2017-09-30 21:43:35] <agronholm> figured out the notification thing – they're displayed on the right side
[2017-09-30 21:44:00] <agronholm> but I still can't figure out how to authorize gitter on my organization – it has never asked for access and I don't know how to make it do so
[2017-10-01 05:56:38] <MadLittleMods> @agronholm Add private repo access for your own user to get it to prompt for the organizationor
[2017-10-01 08:34:09] <agronholm> MadLittleMods: neither button does anything
[2017-10-01 10:12:17] <dothao8_twitter> Y
[2017-10-01 13:06:01] <ghost~559d399815522ed4b3e3a63a> Hi. How can I open gitter in other language?
[2017-10-01 15:45:40] <agronholm> does it have translations to other languages then?
[2017-10-01 16:51:02] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @agronholmCheck your popup-blocker
[2017-10-01 16:51:19] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @ilyaigpetrovChange your OS/browser language
[2017-10-01 16:54:39] <agronholm> MadLittleMods: Resolved. "Allow Private Repo Access" still did nothing but the "Github private access" button did open a new tab when I explicitly added gitter.im to allowed sites
[2017-10-01 16:56:40] <agronholm> hm, actually, I'm still not seeing this organization under "my organizations"
[2017-10-01 16:56:51] <agronholm> how do I fix that?
[2017-10-01 18:21:10] <jfburkhart> MadLittleMods: @fshppicking up on a stale discussion... where on the linux app do you set font-size? I don't find the Dev Tools menu...
[2017-10-01 19:14:12] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @agronholmMake sure you grant private repo access on the org as well, [<-LINK->] 
[2017-10-01 19:15:15] <agronholm> MadLittleMods: that's precisely what I've done
[2017-10-01 19:15:16] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @jfburkhartThere isn't a way but there are some workarounds in [<-LINK->] 
[2017-10-01 19:15:44] <agronholm> I can see in my organization settings that gitter has been granted access to private repos (although there are none)
[2017-10-01 19:16:52] <agronholm> although I don't think it's a problem at this point
[2017-10-01 19:18:43] <MadLittleMods> agronholm: The key is to have your personal public/private Gitter authorized apps match your orgs . And if your org membership isn't public, add private repo scope or make sure your org membership public
[2017-10-01 19:29:09] <Janisku7> MadLittleMods: when Windows10 FCU support comes?
[2017-10-01 19:32:01] <MadLittleMods> @Janisku7 If you are running an Windows insider ring version, then there probably won't ever be guaranteed support. If there is something wrong with the Windows Fall Creators update and Gitter, I won't have a chance to test with it until it is actually released.If you want to try out a future Gitter desktop release, you can run from source with the code in this MR, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/desktop/merge_requests/201
[2017-10-01 19:32:52] <Janisku7> funny it started when bug fixing builds started to ship
[2017-10-01 19:34:03] <MadLittleMods> Janisku7: Perhaps you should add something to the Windows bug tracker about older NW.js apps (link it if you do)
[2017-10-01 19:40:20] <Janisku7> I will
[2017-10-01 20:00:13] <jfburkhart> MadLittleMods: thanks... but I fail to find anything relevant for linux. Looked in the /opt/Gitter directory for any .css for .js files, but found nothing there.
[2017-10-01 20:02:01] <MadLittleMods> jfburkhart: You will need to build from source to get it persistent. You won't find any CSS files as those are in the app itself which is shown via webframe.  Which is why I recommended injecting directly into that frame, [<-LINK->] 
[2017-10-01 20:02:56] <jfburkhart> ok. thanks....
[2017-10-02 05:27:39] <novirium> Hi all. I'm in a bit of a weird situation at the moment, and can't find any solutions in the Gitter documentation.  Some time ago we started a Gitter room around a group Github user (SARSky). That worked fine until we converted that user to an org on Github (which removes it as a user to log in). Ideally we'd now like to start fresh with a Gitter room based on that org, but we can't access the old one any more, and would like to use the same name for the room. Any ideas?
[2017-10-02 07:07:18] <MadLittleMods> novirium: I can clean up things on our end. Please make your org membership public to verify ownership, [<-LINK->] .
[2017-10-02 07:08:00] <MadLittleMods> novirium: What do you want done with the messages in [<-LINK->] ?
[2017-10-02 07:10:05] <novirium> MadLittleMods: Thanks, that'd be great. I've changed org membership to public. We don't mind if all the messages are lost.
[2017-10-02 11:15:09] <lydatech> How do you force a refresh of a profile picture on hover? the display and the hover avatar are out of sync
[2017-10-02 17:04:28] <JamesAddison_twitter> Can someone tell me how to log sign out of the macos desktop gitter app? I've logged in with twitter but want to log in with github. I would have thought I could link the two login types to the same gitter account but no joy: I have two gitter accounts now
[2017-10-02 17:04:34] <JamesAddison_twitter> I'd prefer to use github
[2017-10-02 17:35:03] <vladshcherbin> JamesAddison_twitter: you can turn onShow in Menu Barsetting and sign out from there. UX in its beauty.
[2017-10-02 17:39:47] <JamesAddison_twitter> gah!!!?! ok, thanks,@VladShcherbin
[2017-10-02 18:07:35] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @noviriumI have cleaned up the room, community, and user on our end
[2017-10-02 18:08:05] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @lydatechSign out and sign back in. If it is a Twitter user, there are issues
[2017-10-02 18:08:30] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @JamesAddison_twitterSee [<-LINK->] 
[2017-10-02 18:08:57] <eragon996> ubuntu gitter app should have a back navigation button or shortcut
[2017-10-02 18:09:41] <lydatech> MadLittleMods: I did that no luck, Im using github login
[2017-10-02 18:09:49] <JamesAddison_twitter> ~@MadLittleModsyep, that’s the issue I created. I’ll make a mention and close it~ nevermind, already closed
[2017-10-02 18:10:38] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @lydatechIf you are referring to yourself, your avatars match for me (blue freemason)
[2017-10-02 18:10:42] <daegontaven> MadLittleMods: is it possible to rename a gitter channel ?
[2017-10-02 18:11:13] <MadLittleMods> daegontaven: It isn't possible in the UI by yourself. You can follow these steps: [<-LINK->] 
[2017-10-02 18:12:02] <daegontaven> MadLittleMods: i noticed that there is a "Repo Info" section next to "People". I recently moved my repo to an organization an would like to migrate the chats. Is it possible ?
[2017-10-02 18:12:28] <daegontaven> *"repo info" in this channel i mean
[2017-10-02 18:12:41] <MadLittleMods> daegontaven: Yes, follow the steps I linked. Create the Gitter community with the other org if it doesn't exist already
[2017-10-02 18:13:05] <daegontaven> MadLittleMods: okay, thank you so much !
[2017-10-02 18:16:34] <daegontaven> MadLittleMods: oh wait, so my gitter community(AlphaHooks\Lobby) is already the same name as my organization( i want AlphaHooks\AlphaHooks). What do I do ? Do i ask to rename first, then ask to move again ?
[2017-10-02 18:20:06] <MadLittleMods> daegontaven: Just send this [<-CODE->] 
[2017-10-02 18:21:21] <daegontaven> Thank you once again@MadLittleMods! You've been of great help :)
[2017-10-02 18:21:25] <lydatech> MadLittleMods: Thanks must be my cache
[2017-10-02 18:33:45] <eragon996> Gitter is installed in my Ubuntu 17.04 Its showing in my dashboard but It's not responding when clicked
[2017-10-02 18:49:49] <eragon996> eragon996: solved it with deleting .config/Gitter folder
[2017-10-02 19:00:21] <jmcmurry> The webapp version of gitter seems to have lost its 'log in' / 'sign in' button. All I see is our public rooms.
[2017-10-02 22:36:47] <esden> I am having trouble with my desktop client on MacOS. It suddenly starts with an empty white window. Tried to delete the cache folders without result. What is the procedure to get it back to a working state, or is it a known issue?
[2017-10-02 23:37:16] <jmcmurry> This happens to me all the time, especially on days where bandwidth isn't great
[2017-10-02 23:42:34] <esden> jmcmurry: how do you fix it, as the client in the browser works without problems, only the electron app stopped working :(
[2017-10-02 23:42:49] <jmcmurry> I don't, to be honest. I've just given up.
[2017-10-02 23:42:55] <jmcmurry> I just use the browser version.
[2017-10-02 23:43:04] <esden> >_<
[2017-10-02 23:43:05] <jmcmurry> restarting sometimes helps, sometimes not
[2017-10-03 00:31:20] <esden> Ok, so it seems that opening gitter.im in safari times out on my machine for some reason...
[2017-10-03 00:31:29] <esden> and that is why the "desktop" app fails
[2017-10-03 00:32:52] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @esdenWhat version of the Gitter desktop client are you using? 1.7x is Safari-backed and depends on macOS version, 3.1.x is NW.js backed
What version of macOS are you running?
[2017-10-03 00:33:10] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @jmcmurryCan you share a screenshot? I am not sure what you mean
[2017-10-03 00:34:14] <esden> MadLittleMods: Gitter version: Version 1.177 (1.177)
macOS version: Version 10.12.6
[2017-10-03 00:36:47] <esden> I have just reinstalled the version downloaded from the [<-LINK->] page a minute ago. Also deleted ~/Library/Caches/com.troupe.gitter.mac.Gitter and ~/Library/Application\ Support/Gitter. But it turns out I can open gitter.im in chrome but Safari times out trying to open the page. DNS resolves gitter.im to 54.164.233.143 that does not seem reachable from safari... I guess chrome has some other ip cached or something similar?
[2017-10-03 00:36:52] <MadLittleMods> esden: Are you behind a proxy? [<-LINK->] 
[2017-10-03 00:36:57] <esden> no I am not
[2017-10-03 00:37:05] <esden> just normal router setup
[2017-10-03 00:38:10] <esden> (I am a Comcast customer... for what it's worth)
[2017-10-03 00:38:29] <MadLittleMods> :/ What happens if you change your DNS to 8.8.8.8 (Google)?
[2017-10-03 00:38:31] <esden> interesting dig gives different result: [<-CODE->] 
[2017-10-03 00:39:29] <esden> (the strange thing is that all other pages work fine in safari, it is just gitter.im that seems to be broken, did you guys change your DNS entries recently and the cache is not caught up?)
[2017-10-03 00:40:07] <MadLittleMods> Nope, thedigI just did matches yours. Although I don't use Safari or the 1.7x version of the desktop app often
[2017-10-03 00:40:36] <esden> so there is a newer desktop app I can install?
[2017-10-03 00:41:11] <MadLittleMods> There is a different desktop app you can install, update.gitter.im/osx/Gitter-3.1.0.dmgAnd is what is open-sourced, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/desktopWe don't distribute it because we don't have a great auto-update solution for it yet
[2017-10-03 00:43:13] <MadLittleMods> I am on macOS 10.12.6 and can access Gitter just fine in Safari.If you are having troubles viewing the site in Safari, that would be the issue with Gitter 1.7x. You could try clearing cookies, etc
[2017-10-03 00:43:39] <esden> yes, I will try to clean my cache, and see what the 8.8.8.8 DNS says
[2017-10-03 00:44:04] <esden> cookies for safari is also a good idea
[2017-10-03 00:55:04] <esden> MadLittleMods: ok, some combination of updating the client + reboot ended up resurrecting the desktop client. :)
[2017-10-03 00:55:40] <MadLittleMods> esden: If you moved to 3.1.0, then things generally work (NW.js backed)
[2017-10-03 00:55:46] <esden> Thank you for your help. I should have just rebooted instead of bothering you. On the other hand this way I can play around with the new and shiny 3.1.0 client that I did not know about :)
[2017-10-03 00:56:05] <esden> well, before the reboot the 3.1 did not even open a window
[2017-10-03 00:56:13] <esden> it was stuck ... but after reboot it worked
[2017-10-03 00:56:23] <MadLittleMods> It's a separate program, doesn't even use the same data directory
[2017-10-03 00:56:31] <esden> so something within MacOS caches was screwed probably
[2017-10-03 00:57:47] <esden> MadLittleMods: anyways, thank you for the quick response, it is very appreciated. On another note do you guys have a current roadmap that you share, since the GitLab aquisition your blog went quite silent. I like reading about updates around gitter. :)
[2017-10-03 00:59:45] <esden> None the less, thank you for a great open communication platform! :)
[2017-10-03 01:02:19] <esden> ohh, ok so gitter.im now works also in safari, so it was definitely MacOS being mean to me once again. :)
[2017-10-03 06:37:55] <MadLittleMods> esden: There isn't a roadmap. You can follow the activity on [<-LINK->] 
[2017-10-03 06:55:58] <esden> MadLittleMods: thanks
[2017-10-03 11:19:02] <novirium> MadLittleMods: Thanks for sorting out our weird org situation, works great now
[2017-10-03 14:18:46] <hovancik> Are you guys adding badges to readme or not? I’ve seen you forked my repo but it’s been long long time ago...
[2017-10-03 16:36:51] <MadLittleMods> hovancik: Probably not in that case. If it is a public room you can go to room settings in the top-right -> Share this chat room -> Send Pull Request
[2017-10-03 17:09:57] <jmcmurry> October 2, 2017 2:00 PM @jmcmurry Can you share a screenshot? I am not sure what you mean
[2017-10-03 17:11:28] <jmcmurry> It is intermittent, but the desktop client is often unresponsive / blank / doesn't switch rooms on click. I don't often try client anymore, but it is working ok at moment. Will send a screenshot if I come across it again.
[2017-10-03 17:12:05] <jmcmurry> On occasion the banner of the room changes, but the text in the room does not, leading to some very confusing interactions
[2017-10-03 17:12:46] <jmcmurry> With 30+ rooms, I might be a power user with different requirements than average Jose.
[2017-10-03 17:36:53] <nicksloan> Ugh! If you do the OAuth flow within the application, i have absolutely no reason to believe that you aren't stealing my credentials.
[2017-10-03 17:38:00] <nicksloan> The Mac OS app is useless to me
[2017-10-03 17:38:56] <jmcmurry> Glad that@esdenand I aren't the only ones struggling.
[2017-10-03 17:41:02] <nicksloan> jmcmurry: Can't say whether the app works for me or not. I can say that it isnotsafe to input your GitHub credentials in it. Very disheartening.
[2017-10-03 18:00:14] <cbj4074> nicksloan: Why, specifically, do you say that?
[2017-10-03 18:00:45] <cbj4074> Are you not able to check the endpoints with Dev Tools while going through the flow?
[2017-10-03 18:01:22] <cbj4074> I'm not saying you're wrong, I have never bothered to look. I would definitely want to know if what you say is true.
[2017-10-03 18:03:28] <cbj4074> jmcmurry: I see the same thing with inconsistencies during room-switching. I have about 20 rooms going at once, too, and sometimes messages even appear to be in the wrong room.
[2017-10-03 18:04:01] <jmcmurry> YES so frustrating right? Could lead to massive  faux pas!
[2017-10-03 18:04:20] <cbj4074> Hehe, indeed. Almost has, more than once. ;)
[2017-10-03 18:15:13] <MadLittleMods> cbj4074: @jmcmurryAre you usingchat-cache(turn it off) ? [<-LINK->] 
[2017-10-03 18:16:00] <jmcmurry> current; chat-cache off
[2017-10-03 18:16:29] <MadLittleMods> jmcmurry: When the app goes blank, try visiting gitter.im in Safari. If you also can't visit it there, that is the root cause
[2017-10-03 18:17:02] <jmcmurry> Specifically safari?
[2017-10-03 18:17:09] <jmcmurry> or any browser
[2017-10-03 18:17:14] <MadLittleMods> jmcmurry: Yes, the Gitter 1.7x macOS app is Safari-backed
[2017-10-03 18:17:26] <jmcmurry> oh.
[2017-10-03 18:17:46] <jmcmurry> FWIW, when I go to webapp, I don't have the blank issue
[2017-10-03 18:17:47] <MadLittleMods> jmcmurry: You can read what@esdenwas running into  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-10-03 18:20:13] <MadLittleMods>  October 3, 2017 12:36 PM @nicksloan You can manually authenticate with the NW.js app, http://update.gitter.im/osx/Gitter-3.1.0.dmg [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
[2017-10-03 18:48:19] <nicksloan> cbj4074: Even if I can, they can be logging my keystrokes in their own container. OAuth2 depends on the UA being independent of the consumer. If it's not, the consumer might as well use the Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant.
[2017-10-03 18:49:37] <nicksloan> cbj4074: I'm sure they are not doing anything malicious. But they could be, and since their are better approaches for them to handle this, they shouldn't be trusted.
[2017-10-03 18:54:05] <nicksloan> MadLittleMods: That's helpful for someone like me, but it's disappointing that you take advantage of the trust of most of your users. Especially since you are asking for the credentials of one of your competitors.
[2017-10-03 18:54:40] <nicksloan> I would urge you to open the OAuth2 link in the user's default browser instead.
[2017-10-03 19:16:08] <InternetUnexplorer> nicksloan: Perhaps I am misunderstanding, but how is Gitter "taking advantage of the trust of most of their users"? While passwordscouldtheoretically be stolen, that is a very different thing than saying that they are being stolen.
[2017-10-03 19:17:39] <MadLittleMods> @nicksloan I agree. Feel free to create an issue. Here is a related one (create something new though) https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/1298If you are interested in contributing, the desktop and webapp are open source [<-CODE->] 
[2017-10-03 19:18:58] <nicksloan> InternetUnexplorer: By loading an OAuth2 authorize screen in a context that Gitter controls, they can easily watch the things you are typing... that being your GitHub or Twitter username and password. Most Gitter users, knowing nothing of OAuth2, will presume that this is safe, but it is not.
[2017-10-03 19:19:50] <MadLittleMods> To be clear, nothing malicious is happening. Ideally, the flow should pop out into your trusted browser
[2017-10-03 19:19:50] <nicksloan> InternetUnexplorer: Though, as I've said before, I believe that Gitter is not actually doing anything malicious here... just careless.
[2017-10-03 19:20:55] <nicksloan> Nor am I aware of any way to exploit the behavior as a third-party.
[2017-10-03 19:22:49] <nicksloan> MadLittleMods: Happy to create the issue. Thanks for being open to the criticism. This is a pet peeve of mine, and I've encountered a few services that have not been as willing to have the discussion.
[2017-10-03 19:26:23] <cbj4074> nicksloan: Gotcha! Thank you for articulating the specifics. Your assessment sounds reasonable and fair. 
[2017-10-03 19:26:36] <InternetUnexplorer> That makes sense, thank you for the clarification@nicksloan@MadLittleMods.

[2017-10-03 19:43:51] <MadLittleMods> nicksloan: Thanks :)
[2017-10-03 21:20:46] <texas2010> I have a problem with gitter. I am not sure what problem is. so every day after 5 pm, somehow my gitter stop work as I cant send the message but I could see people still talk. I think gitter got disconnect when I send a message but I cant remember. when I restart my router. it will work again. but the problem is still there after tomorrow 5 pm. any idea to find a problem? it is so odd. my OS verison is mac 10.12.6. i use chrome: 61.0.3163.100
[2017-10-03 21:21:39] <MadLittleMods> texas2010: Do you see a lightning bolt at the top right below the chat header? What happens you try to send a message?
[2017-10-03 21:24:14] <texas2010> lightning bolt? i didnt see that one.   when i send message. somehow gitter stop work. like a wont send require.
[2017-10-03 21:24:37] <texas2010> i will look around when it happen
[2017-10-03 21:25:45] <MadLittleMods> @texas2010 The lightning bolt is an offline indicator when the real-time sockets are not connected.It's still not clear to me what happens you try to send a message when you "cant send the message". What does the app do? What does it look like? Perhaps a screenshare when it happens
[2017-10-03 21:26:36] <texas2010> tbh i dont know why i cant send message during my internet is fine.  just only gitter was down to me.
[2017-10-03 21:27:35] <MadLittleMods> texas2010: What do you mean by down? Does the app look normal? Does it go blank? When try to send a message, does it go into the list of messages and turn red or does it  just stay in the textarea? Do you see any errors in the devtools console or network panel?
[2017-10-03 21:28:45] <texas2010> i didnt check console first.  when i send message. it did turn red.
[2017-10-03 21:31:14] <texas2010> alright. i will check console and screenshot as it happen.
[2017-10-03 22:20:48] <texas2010> MadLittleMods: i did screenshot it.

[2017-10-03 23:38:24] <MadLittleMods> texas2010: Nothing has changed on our end (same servers, same IP's). How long has this been going on? Is it really consistent to 5:00pm everyday? Does it happen with other devices on your network?
[2017-10-03 23:39:10] <MadLittleMods> Can you connect to gitter.im in other browsers when it happens?
[2017-10-03 23:40:59] <texas2010> MadLittleMods: oh odd. since few days ago, I didnt notice when it start. it happened to me everyday. i am not sure what problem is.  I could test on another browser and gitter desktop app tomorrow.
[2017-10-04 06:40:00] <jeckajecka> Hi Good Day. I would like to uninstall the gitter app that I've download last day i already uninstall  it in control panel but it say that there some folder that can uninstall then i restart the laptop and gitter pop up i go to task manager  and disable and locate the folder and i try to delete it but it say the folder is in use and can erase
[2017-10-04 06:48:39] <jeckajecka> MadLittleMods: Hi Good Day.

[2017-10-04 06:54:19] <eragon996> jeckajecka: if you are using ubuntu delete the ~/config/Gitter folder
[2017-10-04 06:55:45] <jeckajecka> eragon996: sorry i'm using win10
[2017-10-04 06:58:59] <eragon996> jeckajecka: try searching gitter in the C drive  if you hit any result then delete it
[2017-10-04 07:03:46] <jeckajecka> eragon996: yes i already check and delete it but it always say that i can't be delete it because it use by other folder
[2017-10-04 08:31:32] <hovancik>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-10-04 08:31:36] <hovancik> MadLittleMods: there is no such a option to create a PR
[2017-10-04 13:23:20] <mydigitalself> jeckajecka: have you checked to see if the Gitter.exe process is still running perhaps and kill it?
[2017-10-04 14:18:59] <EFCHolla> Any one know why gitter 3.1.0 crash when exiting in Ubuntu 16.04?
[2017-10-04 14:33:28] <EFCHolla> No crash reported when quitting from tray icon menu, weird!
[2017-10-04 15:39:28] <jeckajecka> mydigitalself: yes i've check but now i delete the folder but in task manager > Start Up >  Gitter  is still there /
[2017-10-04 16:18:56] <cbj4074> jeckajecka: It sounds like the uninstall mechanism doesn't clean-up after itself. You probably need to do this manually, e.g., [<-LINK->] 
[2017-10-04 16:19:09] <cbj4074> Just delete the shortcuts as appropriate.
[2017-10-04 16:21:47] <InternetUnexplorer> jeckajecka:  [<-LINK->] about completely uninstalling Gitter. It sounds like you may need to deletetoast.exe.
[2017-10-04 16:30:02] <cbj4074> Even better :D
[2017-10-04 18:32:03] <rei-vilo> Is there any plan to translate Gitter into major foreing languages?
[2017-10-04 18:33:41] <InternetUnexplorer> rei-vilo: Please see [<-LINK->] .
[2017-10-04 18:50:24] <rei-vilo> Thanks!
[2017-10-04 22:24:21] <texas2010> MadLittleMods: you are right. nothing wrong with gitter.    something wrong with my router. i didnt change anything in router. oh well.  i did try gitter desktop app.  yep. same problem. when it happened. i went to check on firefox. gitter was loading to me.   thanks.
[2017-10-05 06:41:59] <itssimple> Hi, quick question. How can I make gitter reload public repos from an organization? I tried creating a link for one of the public repos we have, but gitter wanted private repo access. :)
[2017-10-05 06:43:24] <itssimple> .. never mind, I found out that I had to create the room as well. ^^ (Thought it would create automatically)
[2017-10-05 07:55:01] <jeckajecka> InternetUnexplorer: i look at it and follow the steps but the toast.exe is already deleted
[2017-10-05 07:56:14] <jeckajecka> cbj4074: Thanks for this information btw
[2017-10-05 14:31:33] <orangemocha> Hello, I am trying to create a new community, but when I click on "Create and Finish", nothing happens. This happens with both Chrome and IE.
[2017-10-05 14:32:21] <cbj4074> orangemocha: Any errors in the browser's Console?
[2017-10-05 14:32:35] <orangemocha> you mean with F12?
[2017-10-05 14:32:37] <cbj4074> Yep
[2017-10-05 14:32:42] <orangemocha> let me check, thanks
[2017-10-05 14:33:16] <cbj4074> No problem... there are almost always console errors when "things don't work".
[2017-10-05 14:33:17] <orangemocha> 400 {"error":"Bad Request"}
[2017-10-05 14:34:15] <cbj4074> Hmm, seems like something that will require insight from somebody with access to the internals, e.g.@MadLittleMods
[2017-10-05 14:35:33] <orangemocha> I am trying to create a community called (by example)myprojectand associate it withmygithuborg\myproject. I also own themyprojectorg on github, but I would prefer to not to associate it with that. I am wondering if this could be part of the problem.
[2017-10-05 14:36:14] <cbj4074> It seems likely.
[2017-10-05 14:36:37] <cbj4074> Those are precisely the types of cases I've seen raised here before
[2017-10-05 14:37:16] <cbj4074> Unfortunatey, I don't know the ins-and-outs of what's mapped to where and when exactly conflicts will arise
[2017-10-05 14:37:21] <orangemocha> do you know what associating to a github org or repo entails? I could associate it with the org, but I don't really want people to discover it / end up there
[2017-10-05 14:37:50] <cbj4074> I don't :/ But@InternetUnexplorermight
[2017-10-05 14:38:13] <orangemocha> thanks for your help :) I will wait for further insights.
[2017-10-05 14:38:44] <cbj4074> Any time. The aforementioned folks usually pop in a couple/few times a day and rapid-fire-respond, so hang in there and somebody will definitely be able to explain.
[2017-10-05 14:40:14] <orangemocha> 
[2017-10-05 22:18:47] <JamieRRobillardSr> orangemocha: From what I understand of the documentation that I just read if you associate a org with your community then any members of that org will become administrators and the resources of the org could be used in the community with integrations. Some might not require integrations? If you want to keep the organization a secret then it is probably best to not associate it. You can just associate it with your github user account.
[2017-10-06 00:40:31] <georgewsinger> Is it possible to leave voice messages I'm Gitter?
[2017-10-06 00:40:40] <georgewsinger> With some sort of plugin perhaps?
[2017-10-06 01:11:21] <TimJSwan89> Guys, I'm having an issue with Gitter. I can't seem to figure out how to just send someone a private message. I searched for 'groups and people' and they didn't show up, but they show up when I attempt to add someone to a chat room and put in their username.
[2017-10-06 02:01:05] <InternetUnexplorer> cbj4074: @orangemochaI haven't created any communities/rooms in a while, so I'm unclear on the details of how everything works.From what I remember, it's not possible to create a community if an org with the same name exists on GitHub without linking the two.Apologies I couldn't help more; hopefully a member of the Gitter staff can offer clarification.
[2017-10-06 02:02:46] <InternetUnexplorer> georgewsinger: I don't believe that is possible at the moment; Gitter is a purely text-based chat service.
[2017-10-06 02:11:02] <InternetUnexplorer> TimJSwan89: IIRC it's possible to add GitHub users to a room even if they don't have a Gitter account. They will be listed in the room, but you won't be able to PM them/talk to them until they sign up.

[2017-10-06 10:54:19] <orangemocha> how do I delete a community?
[2017-10-06 10:55:21] <orangemocha> or change its settings? I can't find any way to do that
[2017-10-06 10:59:17] <orangemocha> MadLittleMods: I would like the community to be calledmyprojectnotmygithuborg
[2017-10-06 11:08:03] <orangemocha> can I change an existing community github association?
[2017-10-07 02:08:01] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @orangemochaYou can't delete a community yourself. Messagesupport@gitter.imto have it deleted. You can edit community permissions to remove the GitHub association but not change it to another GitHub entity (open a room -> room settings dropdown in the top-right -> Permissions -> Edit community permissions in the bottom-left of the modal)
[2017-10-07 11:51:08] <orangemocha> Thanks@MadLittleMods, I'll follow up with support.
[2017-10-07 11:52:55] <orangemocha> btw, maybe it's just me, but I find the settings icon not very intuitive. I see that icon normally associated with Filters, not Settings. A gear is more common for settings. Just my 2 cents :)
[2017-10-10 21:19:10] <puremourning> Hi guys, I just found a parsing bug in the client.
[2017-10-10 21:19:11] <puremourning>  [<-CODE->] "
[2017-10-10 21:19:16] <puremourning> $$ something “stuff $$”
[2017-10-10 21:19:25] <puremourning> that’s the message i entered (without the markdown)
[2017-10-10 21:19:35] <puremourning> just FYI :)
[2017-10-10 21:20:20] <MadLittleMods> puremourning: What are you actually trying to write?
[2017-10-10 21:20:59] <puremourning> it was contextual, likeI offered him $$ and he said “while i like $$, no thanks”
[2017-10-10 21:21:43] <puremourning> i wasnt’ intending it to be markdown or anything, I just stumbled upon the KaTeX error and thought i’d let you know in case it’s an escaping issue or something.
[2017-10-10 21:23:17] <MadLittleMods> hmm, I'm leaning towards expected because$$is the KaTeX operator that is meant to surround some textLaTeXLaTeXLaTeX
[2017-10-10 21:23:45] <puremourning> oh really. sorry i thought the syntax was markdown
[2017-10-10 21:24:22] <MadLittleMods> Ideally, there would be a way to escape it though for your use case
[2017-10-10 21:24:24] <puremourning> if i write other invalid `markdown*_ i do i get a  ````` error “”' reported
[2017-10-10 21:24:43] <puremourning> seems ok [to me(
[2017-10-10 21:25:03] <puremourning> i guess at least if it fails to parse, would it be possible print the original text (un formatted) ?
[2017-10-10 21:25:15] <puremourning> anyway, not a big dealat all, just bad luck :)
[2017-10-10 21:25:32] <puremourning> or just #mildlyinteresting actually )
[2017-10-10 21:26:14] <MadLittleMods> #mildyinteresting indeedNot sure about decision to show parse error vs original text (feel free to create an issue)
[2017-10-11 02:23:54] <KostyaSha> Hi, i havedocker-javaprivate channel for org members and want create publicdocker-javachat fordocker-java/docker-javarepo seems it conflicts with already existing? Is it possible to rename existing room?
[2017-10-11 02:42:03] <MadLittleMods> KostyaSha: I don't see adocker-java/docker-javaGitter room but [<-LINK->] exists and you need to associate the room with it before you can create it. If you don't see it listed in the typeahead or auto-associate, then you probably need to grant private repo scope on the org or make your org membership pbulci
[2017-10-11 02:45:12] <KostyaSha> well, i want keep docker-java for org members (no associated repo) and create docker-java room with docker-java repo
[2017-10-11 02:45:27] <KostyaSha> or at least rename existing docker-java to some docker-java-org
[2017-10-11 02:45:57] <KostyaSha> or it impossible to have closed room for org members?
[2017-10-11 15:12:31] <MadLittleMods> KostyaSha: You can have multiple rooms per community. You can have the [<-LINK->] org room and thedocker-java/docker-javaroom associated with the public repo
[2017-10-11 15:33:42] <KostyaSha> MadLittleMods: it says that  contains illegal characters
[2017-10-11 15:35:17] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] 
[2017-10-11 15:38:28] <KostyaSha> wow, it works. And what was the other menu?
[2017-10-11 15:39:23] <MadLittleMods> @KostyaSha The "+" in the menu bar is for creating a brand new community which many rooms reside in
[2017-10-11 20:02:31] <foxjazz> Gitter notification and sounds don't work. No way to turn them off.
[2017-10-12 07:04:37] <MadLittleMods> @foxjazz You can adjust your notification settings in a room to "All" or "Mute".If you want to change the desktop sound setting, it's in the context menu
[2017-10-12 15:20:22] <benqxf> hi. sorry if this has been asked before: Using Windows 7 Gitter text is too big. how to reduce the font size and change style? Went to  Gitter | Developer Tools | Elements | but don't know where to  add the font.size.  Please help me. Thank you.
[2017-10-12 16:45:24] <MadLittleMods> benqxf: See [<-LINK->] 
[2017-10-13 12:58:52] <silberzwiebel> Hi thereI highly appreciate that gitter is open source since it was aquired by gitlab! however, development seems to have stalled since some time (according to the latest commits in your gitlab repos). In particular, I was looking for a desktop app and once again was tricked by your advertising that you have a linux desktop app. unfortunately, it's not true, it's only an ubuntu (maybe debian) desktop app.  Could you give a small update about gitter's development status? and, I'd really appreciate a desktop app for fedora linux!many thanks.
[2017-10-13 12:59:57] <hovancik> Ah, so that’s why I’ve seen repos moving to another solutions
[2017-10-13 13:01:20] <silberzwiebel> ?
[2017-10-13 13:02:27] <hovancik> I mean I didn’t know that it was aquired.And  I’ve seen some repos that used Gitter to move to another solutions for discussions...
[2017-10-13 13:03:08] <silberzwiebel>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-10-13 13:03:15] <silberzwiebel> already in march
[2017-10-13 13:04:02] <ghost~559d399815522ed4b3e3a63a> maybe they have moved repos to gitlab, did you check it?
[2017-10-13 13:04:08] <silberzwiebel> but I don't get your point of why repos should move to a different solution then. gitter still continues to work with github (and hopefully soon with gitlab but this is related to my question above)
[2017-10-13 13:04:19] <silberzwiebel> they did, but there is not much activity
[2017-10-13 13:04:41] <silberzwiebel>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-10-13 13:05:12] <hovancik>  [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-10-13 13:09:57] <silberzwiebel> ok, is discord open source?
[2017-10-13 13:13:51] <ghost~559d399815522ed4b3e3a63a> irc-protocol/freenode-network is commonplace, matrix-protocol/riot-client is in dev and heavy on ram
[2017-10-13 14:41:26] <MadLittleMods>  October 13, 2017 7:58 AM @silberzwiebel We have other responsibilities working on GitLab itself which has slowed development. [<-CODE->] There is a MR to add rpm builds but it needs some review and testing (feel free to give it a spin to increase confidence), https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/desktop/merge_requests/196
[2017-10-13 15:31:34] <menviv> Hi all, I'm new to the Etherum network and would like to start developing smart contracts. can someone help me with an ether or two? :) [0xee31c50f045ce272936e27c9215c77008714aece]
[2017-10-13 15:44:06] <MadLittleMods> menviv: This is support for Gitter, the chat app itself, not [<-LINK->] . Please actually read the welcome message when joining a room and mind the room topic at the top in the chat header.
[2017-10-14 09:47:24] <grahamperrin> grahamperrin: raises his voice after weeks of silence
[2017-10-14 09:49:20] <grahamperrin> OT (partial explanation for my silence) I have been heavily occupied by things relating to KDE Plasma 5 etc., on FreeBSD; and overwhelmingly occupied by Firefox-related stuff.
[2017-10-14 21:31:57] <floam> Huh, in one of our channels we just had like an hour of history between a few people disappear. Don't think anyone deleted anything. Did something happen?
[2017-10-14 21:32:58] <MadLittleMods> floam: An admin of the room could have deleted the messages
[2017-10-14 21:33:27] <floam> I'm aware, but pretty sure we didn't.
[2017-10-14 21:33:35] <floam> Just weird.
[2017-10-14 21:33:44] <MadLittleMods> floam: What were their usernames?
[2017-10-14 21:33:51] <floam> floam: and@faho.
[2017-10-14 21:34:11] <MadLittleMods> It's only a specific hour? You have other messages in the room?
[2017-10-14 21:34:14] <floam> We're both admins, neither of us deleted the 20+ messages, AFAIK.
[2017-10-14 21:34:33] <floam> The last hour-two hours of history just disappeared, in the room fish-shell/fish-shell.
[2017-10-14 21:35:54] <MadLittleMods> floam: I don't see any manual commands run on our side
[2017-10-14 21:36:18] <floam> And@mehandes. Still shows up in the archives, just not clients.
[2017-10-14 21:36:56] <MadLittleMods> floam: Do you remember any specific phrases used in one of your messages that was removed? (I can try to find the message in the db)
[2017-10-14 21:37:01] <floam> well... now it is back. Nevermind.
[2017-10-14 21:37:05] <floam> That's darned weird.
[2017-10-14 21:37:54] <MadLittleMods> floam: Was this experienced by other users or just you?
[2017-10-14 21:38:02] <floam> It could just be me.
[2017-10-14 21:38:19] <MadLittleMods> floam: Do you have chat-cache on? [<-LINK->] (turn it off, known broken for some scenarios)
[2017-10-14 21:38:35] <floam> Yes. That's probably it.
[2017-10-14 21:40:03] <floam> Thanks for the help, all seems well.
[2017-10-14 21:41:14] <MadLittleMods> 
[2017-10-15 04:19:18] <Janisku7> MadLittleMods: gitter works in RS4 build
[2017-10-15 04:22:50] <MadLittleMods> @Janisku7 It looks like you are referring to the Gitter desktop app working in the Windows RS4 insider build, ref  October 1, 2017 2:29 PMGood to hear
[2017-10-15 20:30:41] <st_ph_nd_yl__twitter> Hello, Is there a way to remove the _twitter from my username?
[2017-10-15 22:37:51] <MadLittleMods> st_ph_nd_yl__twitter: All Twitter users have the__twittersuffix and there isn't a way to change usernames yet. If don't want a suffix, you could sign in with GitHub
[2017-10-15 23:27:13] <st_ph_nd_yl__twitter> MadLittleMods: Are there any other sign in options, or are those the only two?
[2017-10-15 23:39:37] <floam> I think GitHub is basically the de-facto best natural way to log into Gitter with the least restrictions.
[2017-10-15 23:40:04] <floam> There's gitlab stuff going on, but it's historically been for discussion around GitHub projects, so you should have an account.
[2017-10-15 23:42:58] <floam> Presumably twitter accounts include the__twitterthing to avoid the potential for conflicts, they added that avenue to provide a limited way for strangers to get into a (public) channel.
[2017-10-16 00:42:26] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @st_ph_nd_yl__twitterCurrently, yes. GitLab is coming soon but the first iteration will have__gitlabsuffix
[2017-10-18 18:58:25] <texas2010> MadLittleMods: let you know, i got same problem again. i dont know why it happened again.
[2017-10-19 18:28:30] <troxor> Hello, is there a way to change the access token? I accidentally commited it to git
[2017-10-19 18:28:59] <rebolek> troxor: I feel your pain. There is no way.
[2017-10-19 18:29:05] <troxor> oh, bummer...
[2017-10-19 18:30:03] <rebolek> Let’s hope our repos are ignored until Gitter adds a way to change the token.
[2017-10-19 18:30:26] <troxor> fortunately, I haven't pushed to any remotes, but still more than a minor inconvenience 
[2017-10-19 18:31:03] <rebolek> My repo was cloned by someone, so even if I delete it, it won’t help.
[2017-10-19 18:46:15] <InternetUnexplorer> Hello, is there a way to change the access token?+1, is there an issue for this?
[2017-10-19 19:12:56] <MadLittleMods> @troxor @rebolek I have removed your tokens. You can get new ones from https://developer.gitter.im/apps@InternetUnexplorer See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/679
[2017-10-19 19:14:20] <troxor> MadLittleMods: thanks much!
[2017-10-19 19:19:14] <rebolek> MadLittleMods: wow, thanks!
[2017-10-19 19:44:52] <Alan-FGR> hey guys, are bots allowed? I made a bot to help people at Atomic, basically to store links and warn when users cuss and that kinda stuff, but after a while they can't send messages anymore, not even when manually logging in, tried 2 accounts already, they're not banned but somehow blocked from sending messages
[2017-10-19 21:11:48] <petroemil> Hey guys, are you planning to make the Gitter Windows app available through the Windows (10) Store?
[2017-10-19 23:36:11] <pydo> Is there any way to scale up the UI size in the gitter linux desktop app? Pressing onControl -> +doesn't perform a zoom.
[2017-10-20 01:45:53] <grahamperrin> pydo:  [<-LINK->] @MadLittleMods [<-ISSUE->] is not in the Wayback Machine, can you tell what it was? Thanks.
[2017-10-20 09:03:33] <SISheogorath> Mhm… Am I the only one who noticed that in darkmode the repo info is not readable?
[2017-10-20 09:04:25] <SISheogorath>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-10-20 12:12:58] <pydo> grahamperrin: thanks for the response but the ticket you sent me links to a url on github that returns a 404 -> [<-ISSUE->] 
[2017-10-20 13:28:56] <smunoz> Hey guys/gals. Is there a way to rename or remove and recreate a community. The purpose is to rename the community. Thanks.
[2017-10-20 14:04:49] <InternetUnexplorer> SISheogorath: That's been bugging me as well, check [<-LINK->] .
[2017-10-20 14:12:25] <SISheogorath> ._. It's around for almost a year now :/
[2017-10-20 16:56:24] <silberzwiebel> I'm currently testing the [<-LINK->] (creating .rpm packages for fedora) and was finally able to get an .rpm package. However, the gitter desktop-app won't start. Actually, even without going through the build process, running the development version vianpm start(following [<-LINK->] ) only gives me the following error:
[2017-10-20 16:56:45] <silberzwiebel>  [<-CODE->] 
[2017-10-20 16:59:37] <silberzwiebel> what did I wrong?
[2017-10-20 17:47:20] <InternetUnexplorer> silberzwiebel: Are you using Node.js 4.x?
[2017-10-20 17:57:11] <grahamperrin> pydo: I figured out the relative change of address. Added it to the ticket.
[2017-10-20 19:05:38] <silberzwiebel> InternetUnexplorer:  [<-CODE->] 
[2017-10-20 21:55:10] <satdav> What is the latest version of the Glitter IM Client for Windows
[2017-10-20 21:55:37] <satdav> 3.1.0 I am on
[2017-10-21 00:11:53] <dloukadakis> hello! i have a weird issue i'm getting double notifications and if i disable notifications i'm getting one notification without sound anyone ever experienced something similar?
[2017-10-21 01:59:01] <jp-sauve> I'm having trouble seeing codepen embeds. Linux client. In dev console, I see an SSL error only. gitter shows a large empty space.
[2017-10-21 11:01:51] <THUFIR> how do I connect with pidgin?  error:  broken pipe
[2017-10-21 11:02:39] <THUFIR> ahhh
[2017-10-21 11:03:09] <THUFIR> ok, works now.  (didn't see "ssl" button in pidgin.)
[2017-10-21 12:02:25] <grahamperrin> dloukadakis: two browsers, both set to notify, maybe? FWIW sometimes when I launch Firefox I get notifications for pages that are not yet open.
[2017-10-21 20:21:40] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @Alan-FGRThey are allowed but if you say the same thing over and over, the account will be blocked. Send a message tosupport@gitter.imwith the name of the bot and a permalink to this conversation so we can unblock it
[2017-10-21 20:22:24] <Alan-FGR> MadLittleMods: OK, thank you for your reply.

[2017-10-21 20:23:37] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @SISheogorath@InternetUnexplorerFixed via [<-LINK->] 
[2017-10-21 20:24:42] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @smunozThere isn't a way to rename or remove a community yet. Send a message tosupport@gitter.imwith a link to the current community and your new desired name. Also make sure your GitHub org membership is public it is associated with an org
[2017-10-21 20:25:17] <Alan-FGR> MadLittleMods: I'd like to recommend you not tracking spam in the sandbox room, and possibly also allowing users to make rooms they can use for bot development. It's pretty hard to test bots if you can't send messages, especially when you have a problem.
[2017-10-21 20:25:54] <MadLittleMods> Alan-FGR: Agreed. The spam detection shouldn't worry about a room when you are by yourself
[2017-10-21 20:28:10] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @silberzwiebelPerhaps a sub-dependency didn't follow semver and dropped support for the older [<-LINK->] we were using. You could try porting those rpm changes on top of [<-LINK->] 
[2017-10-21 20:29:23] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @satdavThe latest version is 3.1.0
[2017-10-21 20:32:08] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @dloukadakis-@grahamperrinsituation seems viable  [<-LINK->] - It could be an offline notification from the browser and a notification from the desktop client. It is possible that thewindow.Notificationis being picked up in the desktop client alongside our separate notifier in the desktop with sound but haven't had any reports of that. Usually double notifications is just two separate instances of the desktop app open (check your tray/menu bar)
[2017-10-22 09:30:31] <maxpen> Hey
[2017-10-22 09:31:27] <maxpen> i'm having trouble creating a community

[2017-10-22 15:53:46] <MadLittleMods> maxpen:  [<-LINK->] exists on GitHub. You will need to sign in as that user in order to create a community with that naem
[2017-10-22 18:35:53] <joerg_klein_twitter> I created a new Community with the name hugo-material. I made a mistake. I want kwpse/hugo-material. How can I correct the mistake?
[2017-10-22 19:18:26] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] Send a message to support@gitter.im with a link to the community you want deleted. Be sure to make your org membership public if it is associated with an org
[2017-10-23 08:40:52] <MadLittleMods> @/allWe're doing a quick Gitter AMA from the GitLab summit in Greece at 5pm UTC . Feel free to post your questions, [<-LINK->] 
[2017-10-23 15:34:31] <carymrobbins> is there a way to temporarily disable gitter notifications? can be distracting when they pop up during a meeting
[2017-10-23 17:47:58] <kadaan> carymrobbins: On mac look at the program called "Muzzle".
[2017-10-23 17:51:08] <kadaan> MadLittleMods: Is there a way to report a comment as inappropriate to moderators of a channel?
[2017-10-23 17:51:17] <carymrobbins> kadaan: well i'm on linux :D
[2017-10-23 17:51:31] <kadaan> Crud.  Maybe there is something similar?
[2017-10-23 17:53:24] <carymrobbins> maybe i'll look around, would be nice if gitter supported this though
[2017-10-23 17:53:30] <kadaan> Yeah
[2017-10-23 18:01:31] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @carymrobbinsThere isn't a do not disturb setting yet but you could block browser notifications [<-LINK->] 
[2017-10-23 18:02:11] <carymrobbins> i'm using the native client
[2017-10-23 18:02:35] <MadLittleMods> carymrobbins: I think there are do not disturb settings built into the OS then
[2017-10-23 18:03:08] <carymrobbins> yeah i might as well just turn off the notification daemon for that time period
[2017-10-23 18:03:26] <carymrobbins> although, i have a feeling that gitter will still make it's chime noise, which is really the most distracting part
[2017-10-23 18:25:38] <rakhi2104> 
[2017-10-23 18:25:49] <rakhi2104> Is there an option to zoom in/out ?
[2017-10-23 18:26:31] <rakhi2104> I'm facing trouble on my 4k screen. I can barely read those tiny letters. 
[2017-10-23 18:27:35] <rakhi2104> i'm on Ubuntu 16.04 with Gitter v3.1.0
[2017-10-23 18:36:04] <carymrobbins> the gitter app is just electron, right? i know the slack app let's you zoom in and out, so i presume the gitter one may too
[2017-10-23 18:36:10] <carymrobbins> or rather, it should be possible
[2017-10-23 18:36:23] <carymrobbins> they may need to add it as a feature or something though
[2017-10-23 18:36:38] <carymrobbins> btw, here's a great way to stop gitter's notifications
[2017-10-23 18:36:43] <carymrobbins> killall Gitter
[2017-10-23 18:36:44] <carymrobbins> 
[2017-10-23 18:42:21] <rakhi2104> i assume this would helpapt-get remove gitterand install when the feature is added to it. 
[2017-10-23 22:54:53] <cherchezlafemme> Does anyone know if there is a way for me to prevent my page to be scrolled straight to write a message in Gitter? I have a simple iframe. Every time I load the page it skips the top of the page straight to the chat room 
[2017-10-23 23:35:32] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @carymrobbinsIf you are just after the chime noise, you can adjust it to none in the "Gitter" context menu
[2017-10-23 23:36:32] <carymrobbins> MadLittleMods: where in the native app?
[2017-10-23 23:36:47] <MadLittleMods> carymrobbins: Which platform?
[2017-10-23 23:36:55] <carymrobbins> linux
[2017-10-23 23:37:36] <MadLittleMods> IIRC it is right above the web frame itself, labeled as  "Gitter"
[2017-10-23 23:38:36] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @kadaanNot yet but it is in the list of community moderation work we want to tackle at some point. There is a general report feature in the works but it will be more general instead of pinging the admins of the room itself [<-LINK->] 
[2017-10-23 23:49:54] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @cherchezlafemmeSee [<-LINK->] - The relevant code is here if you are interested in implementing thewindow.postMessagesolution from the issue, [<-LINK->] 
[2017-10-23 23:53:10] <cherchezlafemme> MadLittleMods: thank you! that's  a starting point. I will see if I can stop it from scrolling .
[2017-10-24 02:33:38] <carymrobbins> MadLittleMods: ah ok, thanks got it
[2017-10-24 04:23:26] <mblackritter> Hmmm, I logged in again with GitHub, but it seems still to suffix with _twitter for me.
[2017-10-24 04:24:07] <mblackritter> Oh, no, it doesn't in this room. Another issue that resolved itself.
[2017-10-24 05:35:52] <2m> Hi. I have problems with Gitter Zendesk. I have registered a ticket to move a room after we moved a github repo from one org to another. But I have not heard back for a couple of days. Also zendesk page just keeps redirecting and I can not send a follow up.
[2017-10-24 05:36:04] <2m> Are there currently some ongoing issues with Zendesk?
[2017-10-24 05:36:10] <2m> This was the original ticket: [<-LINK->] 
[2017-10-24 11:44:59] <mydigitalself> 2m: the entire Gitter + GitLab team are on an offsite this week, so we're a little slow on support queries right now with reduced capacity.
[2017-10-24 11:49:45] <2m> Understood. No problem. :) Have fun and productive time!
[2017-10-24 22:57:50] <grahamperrin> @rakhi2104is [<-LINK->] relevant?
[2017-10-25 06:56:04] <vrms> does an admin of a gitter Community has access to the emails of the community members (in terms of  'can download a csv with username, emailaddresse)?
[2017-10-25 07:11:05] <vrms> also ... it seems a users profile is just a link to a github profile. Is there any way to create an independent profile on Gitter (per Community maybe, so you can provide information relevant to the topic)?
[2017-10-27 09:33:24] <Compro-Prasad> how to refer everyone in a message?
[2017-10-27 09:34:09] <Compro-Prasad> all: doesn't work
[2017-10-27 13:29:57] <sarmadzaki> any one who has experience in ionic1  ?
[2017-10-27 14:41:06] <InternetUnexplorer> Compro-Prasad: You can use@/allto mention everyone in a room.
[2017-10-30 03:44:38] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @2m [<-LINK->] is all ready to go 
[2017-10-30 03:45:58] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @vrmsThere isn't a way to export the list of usernames and associated emails for members of a room.
[2017-10-30 03:46:23] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @vrmsWe don't provide Gitter specific users. Only GitHub and Twitter associated users.
[2017-10-30 09:42:15] <2m> Thank you!
[2017-10-30 21:58:06] <arian-swydo> can you guys fix the code snippet horizontal scrolling on ios? sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. Can’t follow any conversation without being able to read the code, makes the whole app near useless
[2017-10-30 22:01:59] <Cyric263> Hi Arian!
[2017-10-30 22:02:28] <Cyric263> I'm Cyric, waves at Arian and the large room of people, hello!
[2017-10-30 22:30:48] <InternetUnexplorer> Cyric263: Hello, what is your Gitter support question?
[2017-10-30 22:32:48] <Cyric263> Hi InernetUnexplorer; which do u think is the best room for GoLang ?
[2017-10-30 22:34:27] <InternetUnexplorer> Cyric263: There isn't an official one ( [<-ISSUE->] ), but you may be able to find an unofficial one somewhere.
[2017-10-30 22:36:44] <Cyric263> ok.
[2017-10-30 22:40:06] <Cyric263> guess I'll go hang in the javascript room! 
[2017-10-30 22:40:14] <Cyric263> later IU
[2017-10-30 22:40:53] <jp-sauve> Cyric263: there will be a golang room on Freenode IRC
[2017-10-31 03:32:37] <MadLittleMods>  October 30, 2017 4:58 PM @arian-swydo This was reported in August but I wasn't able to reproduce then (in the iOS simulator, scrolling horizontally worked fine but I had to scroll vertically outside of the code block).Mind creating an issue with some more details, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues
[2017-10-31 09:14:30] <arian-swydo> MadLittleMods: thanks for the response, I’ll try and get some more details
[2017-10-31 14:15:52] <arian-swydo> submitted@MadLittleMods. Wish I could give you more info, but it just doesn’t work. Maybe a conflict in scrolling context with the page, if I had to make a random guess. ios iphone 6s, most recent version of the app
[2017-11-02 21:11:38] <joshfix> i'm sure this has been asked a thousand times so i apologize in advance, but i'd like to rename a community i created
[2017-11-02 21:11:59] <joshfix> we've formalized our organization and would like it to refer to the new name, while preserving the current history
[2017-11-02 21:12:11] <joshfix> can somebody assist me with this, or do i need to create a ticket with gitter?
[2017-11-02 21:26:37] <haydenhancock> Does anyone else have an issue with removing an app from Gitter developer? I get a 404.
[2017-11-03 10:57:41] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @joshfixSend an email tosupport@gitter.imwith a link to your old community and your new desired name. If it is associated with a GitHub org, make sure your org memership is public
[2017-11-03 10:58:25] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @haydenhancockYou can track [<-LINK->] 
[2017-11-03 11:42:02] <joshfix> thanks@MadLittleMods- i ended up sending a support ticket (6860) online. should i also send an email, or just leave it?
[2017-11-03 12:46:22] <MadLittleMods> joshfix: Same thing ;)
[2017-11-03 21:02:29] <haydenhancock> MadLittleMods: Thanks!
[2017-11-04 15:54:42] <bashfulrobot> Question. Does anyone have any ways that they have worked around the desktop clients intercepting notifications from the mobile client? I know this is by design. But it just doesn't work for our team as we all have multiple desktops, and apps running.. and step away... then using mobile. And people are missing messages all the time. I had looked at the code to see if there was an obvious change that could be made (I'm just a hobby coder). But I could not get that done. I'm just looking for a way to get around this as we like gitter otherwise. But this is becoming a show stopper for us. Right now I personally attempt to get around it by using the IRC bridge and pushing mention alerts to my phone via pushover. Completely hacky (silly) way to do it.
[2017-11-04 17:31:22] <MadLittleMods> @bashfulrobot There isn't a way around it unless you want to setup your own API thing (or your creative IRC usage) That code for that area would be around here, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/tree/master/server/services/unread-items
[2017-11-04 20:16:35] <silberzwiebel> I had some time again to look at the rpm building process for fedora. I followed your suggestion @MadLittleMods to rebase the work on !MR 201. At least now I see a tray icon but nothing more. It gives this error: [<-CODE->] Any ideas?
[2017-11-04 20:17:35] <MadLittleMods> silberzwiebel: Nope, do you get that error if you just run !201 from source?
[2017-11-04 20:17:54] <silberzwiebel> yes, I didn't do anything else yet
[2017-11-04 20:20:04] <MadLittleMods> silberzwiebel: I haven't seen and don't know how to solve that error. Looks more related to the internals of NW/chromium which Google might help with
[2017-11-04 20:20:16] <silberzwiebel> these are the commands I issued: [<-CODE->] I don't have experience in npm and related things, I also tried only [<-CODE->] with the same result
[2017-11-04 20:21:01] <silberzwiebel> so, could it be I'm missing some important packages? what's NW standing for (for help with the googling)?
[2017-11-04 20:21:16] <MadLittleMods> silberzwiebel: npm start -- --remote-debugging-port=1234 --verboseshould be sufficient for you (other parameters are useful for testing the auto-update process)
[2017-11-04 20:21:20] <MadLittleMods> NW.js
[2017-11-04 20:23:12] <silberzwiebel> still doesn't work , same error. I'll try some googling
[2017-11-04 20:51:29] <silberzwiebel> MadLittleMods: I did a restart and installed updates and now, I see a nw.js window popping up (but only at the first start). error is still there in the console and the nw.js window keeps displaying only the logo. Crazy is that when I logout and log back in, the nw.js window is already open (without me starting any program!) Can I somehow debug the app from inside this nw.js window?
[2017-11-04 22:37:49] <silberzwiebel> MadLittleMods: I can start the [<-LINK->] just fine, so I have the feeling it's something in the gitter source code thats going wrong
[2017-11-05 15:04:30] <joshfix> MadLittleMods: thanks for the quick turnaround on that community rename ticket!
[2017-11-06 08:16:23] <grahamperrin> Good news – hopefully – for Firefox users of Gitter who may beoccasionallybugged bymismatches between content, title and URL:
[2017-11-06 08:16:27] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-11-06 15:52:51] <Fryguy> Hi all,  I'm looking for the sources for the android and ios apps...I believe they were available previously, but I can no longer find them, and I don't see them on gitlab either
[2017-11-06 18:32:36] <InternetUnexplorer> Fryguy: They're not publicly available yet, unfortunately.
[2017-11-06 18:38:50] <Fryguy> ah ok, that's unfortunate...is the plan to make them public, since the gitlab announcement?
[2017-11-06 18:57:46] <InternetUnexplorer> Fryguy:  [<-LINK->] , but I have no idea how long it will take.
[2017-11-06 20:36:16] <MadLittleMods> mseder1: Please stop posting a link to a iPhone X video. This room is for Gitter support. Please mind the welcome message when joining a room and the room topic/description at the top of the page
[2017-11-07 06:49:25] <yodalinktal> test
[2017-11-07 06:49:41] <yodalinktal> hello everybody
[2017-11-07 10:03:54] <freesamael> grahamperrin: I'm looking at the issue you mentioned. What looks interesting to me is that when switching between different chatrooms, the document.URL of the iframe doesn't seem to change.
[2017-11-07 10:04:47] <freesamael> So even if I'm in this chat room, window[0].document.URL gives me " [<-LINK->] "
[2017-11-07 10:05:28] <freesamael> That URL becomes what Firefox tries to restore on history navigation.
[2017-11-07 10:06:06] <freesamael> (or session restore)
[2017-11-07 15:16:15] <YuriStruszczynski> Hi everyone! Is Gitter available for enterprise  usage? Maybe even on own Servers? I need a Software like this for  ~5k people.
[2017-11-07 15:56:48] <MadLittleMods> YuriStruszczynski: We don't offer an easy-to-use package but the webapp is open source so you can setup your own instance, [<-LINK->] 
[2017-11-07 15:57:22] <YuriStruszczynski> thx!
[2017-11-07 15:57:36] <YuriStruszczynski> Do you have payed services?
[2017-11-07 15:58:00] <MadLittleMods> YuriStruszczynski: Nope, [<-LINK->] is free and has no restrictions
[2017-11-07 16:08:25] <OptikWebCreative> MadLittleMods: is there a way to install Gitter on our own servers running linux? i cant see any docs for it
[2017-11-07 17:56:42] <InternetUnexplorer> OptikWebCreative: Instructions for getting the webapp up and running are in the README.
[2017-11-07 17:57:19] <InternetUnexplorer> IIRC the instructions are only for MacOS at the moment but the process shouldn't be too different for *nix.
[2017-11-07 17:57:21] <OptikWebCreative> InternetUnexplorer: i only see Mac Server instructions
[2017-11-07 17:57:58] <OptikWebCreative> my server doesnt run docker - (at the moment)
[2017-11-07 17:58:21] <InternetUnexplorer> Hmm, that might complicate things.
[2017-11-07 17:58:22] <OptikWebCreative> will try and use the Mac docs as a guide and write *nix set for the community
[2017-11-07 17:58:36] <InternetUnexplorer> That would be greatly appreciated :)
[2017-11-07 17:58:36] <OptikWebCreative> will be a Debian based install
[2017-11-07 17:58:53] <OptikWebCreative> i could probably do a CentOS version too
[2017-11-07 17:59:11] <OptikWebCreative> will lok at that tomorrow - when I’m back in the office
[2017-11-07 17:59:31] <OptikWebCreative> need to find out what the restictions are on the “Cloud” server platform that I’m Beta Testing
[2017-11-07 18:00:43] <OptikWebCreative> if i cant do it on that platform, i’ll commission a pair of low spec Server boxes, one with Debian and the other with CentOS, would a set of instructions for ISPConfig install also be appreciated?
[2017-11-07 18:01:16] <OptikWebCreative> 
[2017-11-07 20:22:35] <MadLittleMods> OptikWebCreative: The [<-CODE->] will have the latest docs. It only explains how to setup a development environment though. You will need to setup and manage separate services (Redis, ElasticSearch, Mongo, etc) which you will need to figure out from the Docker setup
[2017-11-07 23:52:41] <nafg> I have no Edit ability
[2017-11-07 23:52:55] <nafg> Pressing Up does nothing and the overflow menu has Edit grayed out
[2017-11-08 00:09:27] <InternetUnexplorer> nafg: messages can't be edited after 10(?) minutes.
[2017-11-08 00:09:47] <nafg> InternetUnexplorer: I know that. I can't edit after 0 seconds
[2017-11-08 00:10:17] <nafg> I can delete though
[2017-11-08 00:10:35] <MadLittleMods> nafg: Your OS/browser time is probably off
[2017-11-08 00:10:58] <nafg> MadLittleMods: yeah, ubuntu seems to be stuck in EST
[2017-11-08 00:11:10] <nafg> I guess that explains it. But I still think it's a bug
[2017-11-08 00:13:49] <nafg> It shouldn't rely on browser time
[2017-11-08 00:24:23] <nafg> What if my timezone changes for a legitimate reason
[2017-11-08 00:26:39] <nafg> Also I guess the ability to delete does nott expire?
[2017-11-08 00:29:05] <MadLittleMods> @nafg You can delete whenever you want. [<-CODE->] 
[2017-11-08 00:29:44] <MadLittleMods> For example,Date.now()is1510100966537right now
[2017-11-08 00:30:15] <nafg> I get 1510104613813
[2017-11-08 00:31:31] <nafg> which is about 8:30PM
[2017-11-08 00:31:48] <nafg> MadLittleMods: the problemistimezones. My computer didn't switch to EDT for some reason
[2017-11-08 00:33:02] <MadLittleMods> Date.now()is timezone agnostic and is just a unix timestamp, [<-LINK->] 
[2017-11-08 00:33:17] <MadLittleMods> Your clock is an hour ahead of actual time
[2017-11-08 00:33:34] <nafg> MadLittleMods: well it doesn't look like it's returning UTC
[2017-11-08 00:34:27] <MadLittleMods> nafg: When I look up the current time for  EDT, it shows 7:34 while you mentioned 8:34
[2017-11-08 00:34:39] <nafg> Right. So the timezone is wrong
[2017-11-08 00:35:18] <nafg> My computer is still on EST
[2017-11-08 00:35:55] <MadLittleMods> Whatever you blame it on, your clock is an hour ahead and is the issue (not timezone wise)
[2017-11-08 00:36:36] <nafg> MadLittleMods: the reason why it matters is that it can change for legitimate reasons
[2017-11-08 00:36:59] <nafg> e.g. EDT->EST, traveling on a plane or otherwise crossing timezone boundaries
[2017-11-08 00:40:15] <MadLittleMods> nafg: I can change my timezone to whatever and still get the sameDate.now() [<-CODE->] 
[2017-11-08 00:41:14] <nafg> MadLittleMods: what OS are you on?
[2017-11-08 00:41:36] <MadLittleMods> nafg: Example is from macOS. Same is true on Windows 10
[2017-11-08 00:41:56] <nafg> and earlier windows?
[2017-11-08 00:42:12] <MadLittleMods> I can't test but yes, unix timestamp doesn't care about timezone
[2017-11-08 00:43:20] <nafg> Usually windows sets the PC clock to whatever you set the time to while linux usually set the clock to UTC and use the timezone mainly for display purposes etc.
[2017-11-08 00:43:38] <nafg> but it's a setting. Since I dual-boot to windows I set it to modify the PC clock
[2017-11-08 00:43:52] <nafg> I wonder if chrome on linux assumes the former or something?
[2017-11-08 00:47:13] <MadLittleMods> nafg: Just tested Firefox on Ubuntu 16.04 and it works correctly
[2017-11-08 00:47:47] <nafg> which setting is the clock on?
[2017-11-08 00:48:14] <MadLittleMods> nafg: Be more specific. I tested with GMT-6 and GMT+1
[2017-11-08 00:48:45] <nafg> What does timedatectl print?
[2017-11-08 00:50:42] <nafg> See [<-LINK->] and trytimedatectl set-local-rtc 1. I see that modern Windows supports using bios clock as utc, so maybe I should try that
[2017-11-08 00:52:37] <MadLittleMods> nafg:  [<-CODE->] 
[2017-11-08 00:55:01] <MadLittleMods> nafg: I am not trying anything more. Your clock is off, simple as that
[2017-11-08 12:08:14] <ft9292> Are there any gitter clients for linux?
[2017-11-08 12:31:23] <MadLittleMods> ft9292: The desktop app works on linux, [<-LINK->] 
[2017-11-08 23:07:40] <kodaxx> Is there a known bug with the OSX download for gitter.im?
[2017-11-08 23:08:04] <MadLittleMods> kodaxx: Please describe the bug you are experiencing
[2017-11-08 23:08:32] <kodaxx> When I download from gitter.im homepage - I double click the dmg and it mounts as 'Discord' and does not allow install
[2017-11-08 23:08:39] <kodaxx> Says resource could not be found
[2017-11-08 23:08:55] <kodaxx> Though it shows the gitter logo, even though it says 'Discord'
[2017-11-08 23:09:59] <MadLittleMods> kodaxx: That download hasn't changed in a long time and we haven't had other reports of this. The file you downloaded wasGitter-1.177.dmg?
[2017-11-08 23:10:04] <kodaxx> Yes
[2017-11-08 23:10:52] <MadLittleMods> kodaxx: Trying it out now, it properly opens up the Gitter installer maze screen
[2017-11-08 23:11:19] <kodaxx> Strange...I'm on a brand new install of High Sierra
[2017-11-08 23:11:57] <MadLittleMods> kodaxx: Is it possible you overwrote theGitter-1.177.dmgfile when you downloaded Discord?
[2017-11-08 23:11:58] <kodaxx> Will try a restart
[2017-11-08 23:12:05] <kodaxx> I do not have Discord
[2017-11-08 23:13:10] <kodaxx> “The operation cannot be completed because one or more required items cannot be found (Error code 43)”
[2017-11-08 23:13:20] <kodaxx> This is my error - must be something wrong with my system
[2017-11-08 23:13:25] <kodaxx> I will check into it - thanks
[2017-11-08 23:13:38] <kodaxx> Just confirming that this was not happening for anyone else
[2017-11-08 23:13:57] <MadLittleMods> kodaxx: There hasn't been other reports
[2017-11-08 23:15:03] <kodaxx> Thank you
[2017-11-08 23:36:36] <kodaxx> Just for anyone’s info - the restart worked and gitter is now installed.
[2017-11-08 23:37:00] <kodaxx> It’s the first rule of hardware - if it doesn’t work, restart it
[2017-11-09 01:26:25] <kgashok> Is there any roadmap for including VOICE capture, so a voice chat can be posted into a gitter room?
[2017-11-09 01:26:40] <kgashok> Or is a there plug-in that can bring that feature to gitter?
[2017-11-09 04:36:27] <MadLittleMods> kgashok: No current plans. There might be a separate service out there that could would show a rich embed when you paste a link to it (check iframely support)

[2017-11-10 02:04:30] <grahamperrin> Gitter unreliable with Chromium, Firefox etc.: wrong rooms (mismatch between URL and content)
[2017-11-10 02:26:08] <grahamperrin> freesamael: many thanks for your help inBugzilla@Mozillamaking the issue reproducible with Firefox. It's now more easily reproducible in at least six browsers including Chromium.
[2017-11-10 02:28:28] <grahamperrin> A lazy guess (02:26 in the morning here, I'm somewhat tired):the bug might be avoided by never browsing forward or back within, or away from, Gitter.
[2017-11-10 02:31:46] <grahamperrin> There's also the Firefox container approach, which for some reason (I don't know why) seems to reduce the frequency of the bug in my case.
[2017-11-10 02:41:52] <freesamael> There is a per-process global limit of bfcache in Firefox which defaults to 50 pages. I'm not sure if container is counted separately, but it is possible the reason to inflect repro rate.
[2017-11-10 02:46:58] <grahamperrin> freesamael:  [<-LINK->] reproducible with a new (clean) profile with SeaMonkeywithouta change tobrowser.sessionhistory.max_total_viewers. So I guess that it'll be easily reproducible with a new (clean) profile with Firefox without that change.
[2017-11-10 02:48:39] <grahamperrin> https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/1410#note_38208324… haven't heard any other reports …– for me personally, that's very interesting.
[2017-11-10 02:53:26] <freesamael> That's interesting...
[2017-11-10 02:55:20] <grahamperrin> Gitter aside: I have a notion that the vast majority of people rarely take proper notice of things such as HTML titles. They simply don't notice when an HTML title, or something at the head or side of the page, is misleading or entirely wrong.It all fits with why I abandoned Apple products – after twenty-something years of loving Macs (including five years on private AppleSeed projects) – a few weeks after beginning to test pre-release Yosemite. join me in [<-LINK->] if you like …
[2017-11-10 03:54:05] <MadLittleMods> grahamperrin: To clarify, I could always reproduce when restoring a tab in Chrome. But IIRC, you were reproducing all the time outside of that
[2017-11-10 07:29:54] <grahamperrin> Ah thanks@MadLittleModsI didn't realise, from the issue, that you had the symptom when restoring in Chrome. Did you mention it in a linked issue?
[2017-11-10 07:31:59] <grahamperrin> At its most concise, to reproduce the bug:under ALL CONVERSATIONS click any room other than the one that you're in
browse elsewhere (go forward)
browse back
[2017-11-10 15:10:38] <MadLittleMods> grahamperrin: Yes, see [<-LINK->] where I mention [<-LINK->] 
[2017-11-10 17:08:28] <docgunthrop> I've noticed sometimes people will post an image on gitter, which has a hyperlink tofiles.gitter.im(etc.).jpg. Rather than using markdown to display an image from another site, how does one use the former?
[2017-11-10 17:55:10] <InternetUnexplorer> docgunthrop: Dragging an image into your browser window will upload it to files.gitter.im
[2017-11-10 19:26:52] <docgunthrop> thanks,@InternetUnexplorer
[2017-11-10 20:34:12] <kgashok> Thanks@MadLittleMods
[2017-11-10 21:24:27] <Cyric263> When you setup a gitter.im chat room it remembers everything posted... is there a way to have it not remember everything?
[2017-11-10 22:58:46] <InternetUnexplorer> Cyric263: Aside from deleting your messages, I don't think there is.
[2017-11-11 16:56:48] <grahamperrin> freesamael: FYI [<-LINK->] 
[2017-11-12 00:28:10] <vrms> hei, we are in China an have no google play store available therefore. How can you get the gitter App for android under such circumstances?
[2017-11-12 00:31:16] <vrms> @MadLittleMods October 25, 2017 1:56 AM @vrms There isn't a way to export the list of usernames and associated emails for members of a room.
[2017-11-12 00:33:16] <vrms> any specific reason fornothaving that functionality (download of user's email address)?@MadLittleMods
[2017-11-12 01:36:30] <Betree> Hello, I was testing the service and deleted the community I had just created. Now when I try to re-create it it tells me the name is already taken
[2017-11-12 01:37:33] <Betree> is there any way to un-delete or to clear the domain lock ? (community name is CaptainFact)
[2017-11-12 01:40:26] <Betree> Eratum: My bad, seems like I had not deleted the community - only main room
[2017-11-12 03:07:50] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @vrmsThere are services out there to download the apk given a play store URL
[2017-11-12 03:08:58] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @vrmsIt's currently not what people sign up for when joining a room so to speak. A big concern would be spamming people
[2017-11-12 04:43:53] <vrms> so, it's gitter policy, not a missing feature then. Got it, thanks for clarifying@MadLittleMods
[2017-11-12 07:43:45] <vrms> MadLittleMods: >  [<-LINK->] @vrmsThere are services out there to download the apk given a play store URL
[2017-11-12 07:46:33] <vrms> don't really understand that sentence logically. Can it be you mean I may be able to find a source (that I then would have to decide whether trustworthy or not) for the .apk file somewhere? Ideally there would be a direct download from the gitter website I think
[2017-11-12 08:45:19] <grahamperrin> MadLittleMods: just FYI, looking closely at one of the four browsers in my shot at (closed) [<-LINK->] therewasNEXTin Chromium. (Sorry for missing that. It's a rarely used browser.) This morning I checked [<-LINK->] in Chromium, confirmed that whist NEXT was enabled, chat-cache was not. Chromium is now switched to GitterCurrent.
[2017-11-12 08:53:53] <grahamperrin> Here's a rarity, probably involving an extension to Firefox:
[2017-11-12 08:54:08] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-11-12 08:58:46] <grahamperrin> – the messages will appear in response to forcing a reload without the browser cache (e.g. Control-F5 with Firefox on FreeBSD) but then it's sane to re-check that you're in the correct room before proceeding to post.
[2017-11-12 09:02:57] <grahamperrin> Re: [<-LINK->] whilst I don't want to add noise to that bug, it may be worth noting that Firefox session restorationdoeshave some weird shit going on. In addition to the staleness bug, yesterday I stumbled across [<-LINK->] 
[2017-11-12 09:03:06] <grahamperrin> … RESOLVED FIXED in Firefox 58 …
[2017-11-12 09:04:21] <grahamperrin> – but it's not clear whether it also affects ESR 52.x, release 56.0.2 or pre-release 57.x. I'll ask in the#firefoxchannel on moznet.
[2017-11-12 09:07:10] <grahamperrin> Debatably weird, as in: this morning, whilst Firefox 56.0.2 restored a session that includeshttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/1833I saw (in the sidebar of Vertical Tabs Reloaded, probably also in the title bar)firstthe edited (non-original) title of that issue,thenthe original (non-edited) title … and so on.
[2017-11-14 08:38:10] <vrms> how can I start a private conversation with just one other user from a certain room?
[2017-11-14 09:04:50] <lostllama> gunnar: Click their name and select "chat privately"
[2017-11-14 16:01:36] <MadLittleMods> vrms: You can also use/query @username
[2017-11-15 05:58:46] <KillingJacky>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-11-15 05:59:01] <KillingJacky> why can't create a community for an org?
[2017-11-15 05:59:31] <KillingJacky> what does the error icon mean?
[2017-11-15 07:24:25] <MadLittleMods> KillingJacky: Click "Next" to see the native form error tooltip. The community probably already exists
[2017-11-15 07:43:07] <KillingJacky> Yes, the community already exists. I finally managed to create the chat room directly with the “add a room” button.
[2017-11-15 10:14:25] <silberzwiebel> vrms: have a look at [<-LINK->] 
[2017-11-15 12:02:22] <vrms> thanks@silberzwiebel@MadLittleMods@lostllamawill check that out
[2017-11-15 18:44:38] <thinkocapo> Hello, how do I change my profile pic? I've tried clicking everything I can find  - the pic itself, Home, menu buttons,
[2017-11-15 18:46:23] <MadLittleMods> thinkocapo: Update it on GitHub, then sign out and sign back in to Gitter
[2017-11-15 18:46:25] <thinkocapo> oh github
[2017-11-15 18:46:25] <thinkocapo> yes
[2017-11-15 18:46:27] <thinkocapo> just realized
[2017-11-15 18:46:35] <thinkocapo> ORganization pulls from github too, thanks!
[2017-11-15 20:18:21] <wviechtb> Hello -- just started a community for a project. So far, so good. Trying to create some rooms inside of it. Mostly works. But then I try to create a room with the name "topics" and it says "Validation error". Any ideas what the problem might be?
[2017-11-15 20:38:49] <MadLittleMods> wviechtb: topicsis reserved, ex. [<-LINK->] 
[2017-11-15 20:45:36] <wviechtb> MadLittleMods: That applies to all communities?
[2017-11-15 20:47:40] <MadLittleMods> wviechtb: The name reservation applies to all communities but the topics feature itself has to be enabled manually by Gitter staff and is still in beta
[2017-11-15 20:48:21] <wviechtb> MadLittleMods: Okay, clear. Thanks.
[2017-11-16 00:12:15] <vrms> picked up somewhere/topic stringwould conduct a serach forstringinside of a room
[2017-11-16 00:12:21] <vrms> /topic string
[2017-11-16 00:13:02] <vrms> actually (as shown above) creates a message "/topic string"
[2017-11-16 00:13:54] <vrms> any other way to search a particular string in a room?
[2017-11-16 00:15:02] <vrms> (not after searching all communities like you do byctrl + s)
[2017-11-16 01:23:59] <mstellaluna> is there a gitter admin online?
[2017-11-16 01:24:04] <mstellaluna> its important and urgent
[2017-11-16 01:45:35] <vrms> if you'd describe your issue@mstellalunaeven other people then gitter admins may be able to  help you. If you don't, nobody will
[2017-11-16 01:46:04] <mstellaluna> vrms: its not gitter related its a urgent matter concerning a member. its why I need an admin
[2017-11-16 01:46:57] <vrms> alright, got it. Maybe you can tag someone directly and likewise get attention quicker
[2017-11-16 01:47:53] <vrms> I'd just look for ppl who frequently respond to queries here. they may be the admins you are looking for
[2017-11-16 01:49:09] <mstellaluna> k
[2017-11-16 01:49:34] <vrms> Eric Eastwood, Marc-Alexandre Chan are listed with issues on the activity pane. so I'd suspect them to be on the core team
[2017-11-16 01:49:54] <mstellaluna> vrms: thanks
[2017-11-16 01:51:35] <vrms> I'd do that only if the matter is more severe then an annoyance though
[2017-11-16 01:52:02] <mstellaluna> vrms: its quite important otherwise I wouldn't bother
[2017-11-16 01:52:47] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @vrms/topic xxxwill set the room topic not search. The only search (can be accessed withCtrl + S) searches in the current room not all rooms.
[2017-11-16 01:53:15] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @mstellalunaChatting with you now ;)
[2017-11-16 01:53:37] <mstellaluna> MadLittleMods: i'll send u an IM
[2017-11-16 02:04:43] <vrms>  [<-CODE->] 
[2017-11-16 02:05:02] <vrms> true, thanks.
[2017-11-16 02:08:30] <vrms> to search for messages from a particular user in a particular room does not seem to be possible withctrl +squeries though. You can find that user and then go into a 1:1 conversation, but not his/her messages in a room. Or do I miss something?
[2017-11-16 02:49:51] <MadLittleMods> vrms: You can usefrom:MadLittleMods
[2017-11-16 03:04:21] <vrms> cool thanks. feature request ... make that [<-CODE->] `,  you'll get results
[2017-11-16 08:46:15] <KwadroNaut>  [<-LINK->] has a wrong link underneath the irssi problems chapter, [<-LINK->] gives me a 404.
[2017-11-16 08:49:57] <KwadroNaut> Can someone add there that contrary to oldschool well established irc-usage, capitalization matters for your irc bridge?
[2017-11-16 15:06:32] <Janisku7> well for IRC you could check IRCv3 specs
[2017-11-16 15:07:14] <Janisku7> as modern irc have this cap-notify in connecting
[2017-11-16 15:07:56] <Janisku7> KwadroNaut: irc prefer lowercase
[2017-11-16 15:26:32] <InternetUnexplorer> https://github.com/gitterHQ/gitter/issues/314#issuecomment-53422090 gives me a 404.@KwadroNaut Issues were recently moved to GitLab.
[2017-11-16 15:27:48] <KwadroNaut> InternetUnexplorer: then, fix the link ;-)
[2017-11-16 15:31:15] <KwadroNaut> Janisku7: iIprefer lower case, the problem was my github username (with capitalisation, because, github). You know a way of telling the bridge to use 'kwadronaut' and not KwadroNaut?
[2017-11-16 15:40:28] <Janisku7> so bridge where github the username isnt lowercase and in irc endpoint it's lowercase
[2017-11-16 16:20:52] <KwadroNaut> Ideally, I'd want the bridge not care about capitalization and people can use JaNiSKu7 or Janisku7 or janisku7 and that'll all be the same.
[2017-11-16 16:21:21] <KwadroNaut> Not sure if that's a realistic request?
[2017-11-16 17:00:28] <Janisku7> KwadroNaut: in my case the I could use JaniSKU7 or Janisku7 or janisku7 hehe
[2017-11-16 17:00:56] <Janisku7> or in one case jaNisku7 as pick N7 from it :D

[2017-11-21 16:49:04] <serapath> hello
[2017-11-21 16:50:26] <serapath> i'm having a problem with creating another chat room. posted here: [<-LINK->] Giess this room would have been better. I find it really hard to figure out how to allow/enable to make a chatroom for a github repo.I remember it was easier in the past and i think it ran into this issue repeatdly :/ i'm sry - but would be happy if somebody could help me out
[2017-11-21 18:39:37] <MadLittleMods> serapath:  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-11-21 19:29:06] <serapath> @MadLittleMods doesnt really help.I checked now: [<-CODE->] ...nothing helped
[2017-11-21 19:30:50] <serapath> This seems to be quite hard. :/
[2017-11-21 19:32:09] <serapath> clearing the cache did not help either (I deleted all local data in Applications clear cache in the devtools + refresh hard reset)
[2017-11-21 19:32:13] <serapath> ...but no changes
[2017-11-21 19:32:25] <serapath> Am I the only one with this problem?
[2017-11-21 19:39:22] <MadLittleMods> serapath: When you say you added gitter to [<-LINK->] , did you add public and private scope?
[2017-11-21 22:17:38] <serapath> MadLittleMods: both are there - so i can revoke both ... so i guess i already added both in the past
[2017-11-21 22:25:30] <MadLittleMods> @serapath Pehaps I should ask, what are you expecting to happen in the UI to create a room connected to a repo? [<-CODE->] 
[2017-11-21 23:52:47] <serapath> MadLittleMods: it's not showing up
[2017-11-21 23:53:14] <serapath> MadLittleMods: the amigonia org is not showing up. i cannot select it
[2017-11-21 23:57:02] <MadLittleMods> serapath: Looks like you haven't created aamigoniacommunity yet on Gitter. Click the+button on the left menu bar to start that process
[2017-11-21 23:58:05] <serapath> oh, this explains a lot. I was thinking i can just pressAdd a roomand select any of my github orgs and then any of my repos. I wasn't even aware of the+button until now. thx. i'll try that
[2017-11-22 00:58:22] <serapath> MadLittleMods: sweet, it worked. Would you now be able to merge the rooms? I can also write another email or respond to you via the support email :-)
[2017-11-22 01:08:41] <MadLittleMods> serapath: Reply to the support ticket please. I handle those in batches
[2017-11-22 01:58:37] <serapath> ok
[2017-11-22 06:31:59] <bhcrosslake> I'm not seeing images from GitHub entered using Markdown
[2017-11-22 06:33:45] <bhcrosslake> Repo is public [<-LINK->] 
[2017-11-22 06:35:38] <MadLittleMods> bhcrosslake: https://github.com/mojaloop/docs/blob/master/Wiki/Basic%20Overview.pngis a HTML page, not an image
[2017-11-22 06:38:56] <bhcrosslake> Ah! It works in GitHub, but here I'd need: [<-LINK->] 
[2017-11-22 06:39:09] <bhcrosslake> Thanks!
[2017-11-22 16:56:43] <serapath> MadLittleMods: hey thx, it worked :-) the channels seem to be merged, but the people from both channels were not added, not they start to write messages in the old channels and wondering why all the messages are gone
[2017-11-22 18:46:45] <IGBC> So... this thing is IRC in modern, or what?
[2017-11-22 18:52:58] <InternetUnexplorer> IGBC: Pretty much. It was originally designed as chat for GitHub, but there are lots more integrations available nowadays.Also, there's an IRC bridge @ irc.gitter.im if you prefer using that :)
[2017-11-22 19:01:30] <IGBC> InternetUnexplorer: cool athough a bridge that connects the web gui to IRC might be more useful
[2017-11-22 19:02:29] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @serapathWe don't move room membership. I already setup redirects that will work once you delete the old rooms
[2017-11-22 19:03:07] <serapath> aha, so i need to manually invite everyone over and then i would delete the old room?
[2017-11-22 19:03:36] <MadLittleMods> serapath: If you wish to, yes
[2017-11-22 19:04:15] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @IGBCYou can setup a bot  to sync things, [<-LINK->] 
[2017-11-22 19:06:15] <serapath> MadLittleMods: just tried, but it seems the adding people field does not allow me to add most of the people.When I put their nickname, the autocomplete does not show them....both rooms have around 200 peole
[2017-11-22 19:06:17] <serapath> people
[2017-11-22 19:06:20] <serapath> thats a lot of manual work :/
[2017-11-22 19:07:12] <MadLittleMods> serapath: That autocomplete can be a bit slow and might take a bit of time to have them show up
[2017-11-22 19:08:00] <MadLittleMods> serapath: You could leave a link to the new room for a couple of days and then delete the rooms to let the redirect pick up the remaining active users
[2017-11-22 19:08:12] <serapath> I tried now 3 handles and waited for more than 10 seconds, but nothing shows up and hitting enter does nothing
[2017-11-22 19:08:30] <serapath> oh, so when i delete the room, they will be redirected? next time they enter the room or use gitter?
[2017-11-22 19:09:17] <MadLittleMods> serapath: It's not super nice because the room won't be listed for them anymore but they will be redirected if they try to visit it directly
[2017-11-22 19:09:58] <serapath> so if i delete the old room, it disappears from their channel list and they manually have to remember to add and visit the room via URL and then get redirected to amigonia?
[2017-11-22 19:13:30] <serapath> MadLittleMods: puh... nope, I can't add anyone - the autocomplete does nothing.I think the important thing for us would have been to automatically move the people to join all of them into one channel.If this is not possible, we would rather move the messages back and do nothing.This has no use to us :/is it possible to cancel the whole thing?
[2017-11-22 19:14:24] <serapath> this would have been good to know in advance :/ damn - sry. i probably should have asked all about the details.It's just we once did this already in the past and i just assumed moving the people would totally work again
[2017-11-22 19:15:25] <MadLittleMods> serapath: We can't really go back because the messages are mixed together now. We could transfer the messages back to one of the rooms and rename that room
[2017-11-22 19:15:59] <serapath> oh noooo - what have i done 
[2017-11-22 19:16:46] <MadLittleMods> serapath: How often are your users active? Would a link to the new room over a week not pick up the people that actually use the room?
[2017-11-22 19:17:05] <MadLittleMods> Anyone with bookmarks or browser autocomplete will be redirected after that week because of the redirect
[2017-11-22 19:17:22] <serapath> some of them are active regularly, but many of them more rarely
[2017-11-22 19:17:46] <MadLittleMods> You would be losing inactive people who visithttp://gitter.imand look for the room the sidebar and can't remember
[2017-11-22 19:18:00] <serapath> 10% of people are very active, 30% moderately and 50% rare
[2017-11-22 19:18:27] <serapath> i think none of them would remember the room
[2017-11-22 19:18:35] <serapath> because it sits in their sidebar
[2017-11-22 19:18:50] <serapath> i dont even know all of my rooms and might just forget its existance if it would disappear from my sidebar
[2017-11-22 19:19:00] <serapath> only maybe a few most frequented ones i would remember
[2017-11-22 19:20:26] <MadLittleMods> Are those other rooms you can't remember useful to you though? Do you actually read those messages?
[2017-11-22 19:21:32] <serapath> yes. i have a lot of rooms that are topic oriented, so i visit them from time to time when i have a need.sometimes i get mentioned, and then i check - but of course - mentioning does not work any more if i am no in the room
[2017-11-22 19:21:40] <serapath> especially the@all
[2017-11-22 19:22:08] <MadLittleMods> Mentioning would work except for all mentions
[2017-11-22 19:22:09] <serapath> some channels are project related so its rare that messages are written there
[2017-11-22 19:22:29] <serapath> but when somebody writes a message and i see the green flag in my chat room menu, i click, but if there are no new messages i dont visit
[2017-11-22 19:22:36] <serapath> ...i would probably not notice if the room was gone
[2017-11-22 19:22:56] <serapath> but the "mentioning" doesnt show names of people who are not in the channel
[2017-11-22 19:23:21] <MadLittleMods> serapath: The mention will still work even if not in the autocomplete
[2017-11-22 19:23:23] <MadLittleMods> I think the best action here is to transfer the messages back to one of the rooms and rename that room. Is there any overlap to capture most of the people?
[2017-11-22 19:24:05] <serapath> can all messages be moved to both rooms?
[2017-11-22 19:26:24] <MadLittleMods> @serapath NoI don't think you should worry about capturing all of the inactive users. People will find the room again if they need it
[2017-11-22 19:27:45] <serapath> ok, then lets move all the messages to the wizardamigos/program chat
[2017-11-22 19:27:56] <serapath> and maybe forward the codingamigos/chat channel to that one too
[2017-11-22 19:27:58] <serapath> so no amigonia chat
[2017-11-22 19:28:21] <serapath> then we will try to tell people in the condingamigos/chat to move over to the wizardamigos/program chat
[2017-11-22 19:28:56] <MadLittleMods> You could write a script to invite the users listed here, [<-LINK->] (look in the devtools to see what the UI normally does)
[2017-11-22 19:29:02] <serapath> ...and in the future, but maybe not immediately - we would rename the wizardamigos/program chat to amigonia/amigonia chat? if that is possible ...i guess i can link the amigonia repo activity feed to that chat too
[2017-11-22 19:29:13] <serapath> ah sweet
[2017-11-22 19:29:14] <serapath> thx
[2017-11-22 19:29:17] <serapath> i'll try that too
[2017-11-22 19:29:26] <serapath> but could you confirm this above would work?
[2017-11-22 19:30:22] <MadLittleMods> That would work. I'll wait until a support ticket comes in if you want to try out scripting it first
[2017-11-22 19:31:15] <serapath> i see
[2017-11-22 19:31:16] <serapath> ok
[2017-11-22 19:47:09] <serapath> how do i get the room ID?
[2017-11-22 19:48:50] <MadLittleMods> serapath: Let's move to  [<-CODE->] 
[2017-11-23 19:43:33] <mbrookes> Hi!We've recently moved our repo to a new github org https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui. How do we move the gitter chat https://gitter.im/callemall/material-ui to reflect the new org name, while retaining the user list and chat history, with forwarding from the old gitter chat URL?Thanks!
[2017-11-24 06:50:03] <MadLittleMods> mbrookes: Create themui-orgcommunity on Gitter. Send a message tosupport@gitter.im. We can move the room over to the new community.
[2017-11-24 17:34:50] <mbrookes> Thanks@MadLittleMods
[2017-11-25 02:47:05] <HenrikBechmann> Hi I'm trying to use gitter sidecar, but when I click on "Open Chat" I get the dreaded "404. This is not the room you're looking for" The link is for a room that I specified as public.
[2017-11-25 02:47:12] <HenrikBechmann> Any suggestions?
[2017-11-25 02:47:29] <HenrikBechmann>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-11-25 03:33:53] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] That snippet is working for me
[2017-11-25 07:25:58] <HenrikBechmann> Duh. I had put in the entire url. Thanks@MadLittleMods!!
[2017-11-26 13:45:17] <hhirsch> How can I ban a user?
[2017-11-26 13:46:00] <hhirsch> I have this user that was trolling on github and now he won't stop joining gitter and troll there.
[2017-11-26 13:51:17] <hhirsch> Nvm. see you guys.
[2017-11-26 13:51:22] <hhirsch> Found the ban command.
[2017-11-26 15:50:25] <eldadf82> Hi i have a problem with some tokens is there some one from support here in this room ?
[2017-11-26 18:09:11] <MadLittleMods> eldadf82:  Which users are the tokens from?
[2017-11-27 07:36:54] <silberzwiebel> notification settings do not work for me: I've set the overall deafult (and the same for every single room) to "Announcements: Notify me for mentions and announcements" but I'm still getting e-mails every second day or so for messages, I don't want to be notified.
[2017-11-27 08:02:34] <MadLittleMods> silberzwiebel: Emails are tied to unreads. Set your rooms to "Mute", see [<-LINK->] 
[2017-11-28 05:17:12] <lv2eof> Hello. How can I leave a room?
[2017-11-28 06:33:55] <MadLittleMods> @lv2eof You can't leave a one to one room (private message with another person), only hide it from the conversation list, [<-CODE->] 
[2017-11-28 12:28:30] <amosbird> hi. how can I hide the title bar [[file:/home/amos/Pictures/Screenshots/img-2017-11-28-202825.png]]
[2017-11-28 12:28:43] <amosbird>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-11-28 15:01:52] <InternetUnexplorer> amosbird: Hiding the title bar isn't possible at the moment; you can only collapse the side bars.
[2017-11-28 15:08:15] <amosbird> Ok, any plan to suppport that :)
[2017-11-28 15:09:21] <InternetUnexplorer> amosbird: Not that I am aware of, but you could check the issue tracker to see if there is an existing issue. If not, feel free to open a new one :).
[2017-11-28 15:09:43] <InternetUnexplorer> Issue tracker is [<-LINK->] .
[2017-11-28 16:50:40] <amosbird> ok, thanks
[2017-11-28 19:30:38] <gracicot>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-11-28 19:30:40] <gracicot> Hi everyone. Have you even encountered this issue? I cannot create a community is this website for my github project.
[2017-11-28 19:31:08] <gracicot> I have no private repository and I'm not part of any organization
[2017-11-28 19:46:40] <gracicot> I tried to activate "Allow Private repo access" on the menu but it make that button and the "create community" button freeze until I logout and login again.
[2017-11-28 19:50:10] <gracicot> I even tried opening a ticket on the support page, but when I clicked on [<-LINK->] on inbox, the page reload each seconds indefinitely saying "Failed to Update User"
[2017-11-28 19:51:02] <gracicot>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-11-28 19:53:52] <gracicot> After waiting a while on this page watching it reloading each seconds, the error changed to "Too many failed login attempts. Please try again later"
[2017-11-28 19:54:11] <gracicot> Can anyone help me? I just want to create a community on this website. It seems I hit every possible bugs. Is my account corrupted or something?
[2017-11-29 00:55:50] <gracicot> Okay... I managed to add  private access to my github
[2017-11-29 00:57:03] <gracicot> However, I still cannot create the community. I have the same error as before. It needs private access, even though it already have them
[2017-11-29 00:57:25] <gracicot> Here's a proof I'm not crazy:
[2017-11-29 00:57:31] <gracicot>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-11-29 00:58:13] <gracicot> Yet,
[2017-11-29 00:58:20] <gracicot>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-11-29 01:01:34] <MadLittleMods> gracicot:  [<-LINK->] already exists on GitHub. Thekangarucommunity on GitHub would need to be associated with that org in order to be created
[2017-11-29 01:02:36] <gracicot> oh. But in the form, I selected my repository: [<-LINK->] 
[2017-11-29 01:03:28] <gracicot> So I cannot create a room for a repository that has the same name as a user? Can I use another name and then link it to my repo?
[2017-11-29 01:03:34] <MadLittleMods> That error is a guess that you may be the owner ofkangaruGitHub org and we just can't see it yet. But we should probably add another case where if you already associated a different GitHub entity, then we say you need to associate it with the proper GitHub entity. Feel free to create an issue, [<-LINK->] 
[2017-11-29 01:03:48] <MadLittleMods> gracicot: Correct, you just need to change the URL
[2017-11-29 01:05:19] <gracicot> ok. I'll try this. Thank you very much for answering me
[2017-11-29 01:19:28] <gracicot> I tried with another, but it doesn't seem to integrate as well as creating it for a github repository. I'll report the bug
[2017-11-29 04:47:53] <MadLittleMods> gracicot: Thanks for the report, [<-LINK->] 
[2017-11-29 13:54:04] <jasonfb> Can anyone help me log out of the Mac desktop app? I can't find any "log out" button, no "my account" page, I've trashed ~/Library/Application Support/Gitter but the app still opens to the same state every time I open it. I want to reset the app to its original state and create a new account for Gitter. Any help would be appreciated. thanks.
[2017-11-29 14:40:43] <karl-gustav> How do we get issued a new "Personal Access Token" for gitter?
[2017-11-29 15:07:13] <InternetUnexplorer> jasonfb: Try clicking the gitter icon in the status bar (top right of your screen IIRC). There should be a log out option in that menu.
[2017-11-29 16:28:07] <singularity87> Hi. We are building our community on Gitter. One key feature we cannot seem to find is the ability to sticky information to a room. Is there a way to do this?
[2017-11-29 16:28:42] <singularity87> sticky/pin so that people can always find info quickly.
[2017-11-29 18:47:10] <cbj4074> I'm not aware of any such feature. Discord and others implement that, but not Gitter. Conversely, Gitter provides the ability to link to a specific message (byAlt-Clicking the timestamp to the right of the message). Now if only both platforms could do both things...
[2017-11-29 18:47:44] <cbj4074> singularity87: ^
[2017-11-29 18:47:52] <singularity87> That's a bit frustrating. It seems like such a basic but important feature.
[2017-11-29 18:48:07] <cbj4074> Agreed. And the same can be said of the converse in Discord. It's hard to believe.
[2017-11-29 18:48:48] <cbj4074> Nobody has told you that you have to run Slack, Gitter, and Discord all at once to get anything done? ;)
[2017-11-29 18:52:55] <cbj4074> ^ That's kind of a joke... but not really. All of these platforms implement things differently and none of them does it  all.
[2017-11-29 18:53:32] <singularity87> There is no reason for them not to though.
[2017-11-29 18:54:42] <cbj4074> Again, I agree completely. I've spent quite a bit of time digging, upvoting feature requests, and ranting/raving.
[2017-11-29 18:54:50] <cbj4074> None of it seems to help! :D
[2017-11-29 18:55:20] <cbj4074> But, at least Gitter is open-source, so there's hope.
[2017-11-29 19:25:39] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @karl-gustavSend a message tosupport@gitter.im
[2017-11-29 19:28:02] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @singularity87See [<-LINK->] , MR welcome
[2017-11-29 19:36:02] <cbj4074> Upvoted! :D
[2017-11-29 23:32:34] <InternetUnexplorer> It looks like the last commit to the webapp (develop branch) was over a month ago...
[2017-11-30 00:40:53] <esden> MadLittleMods: hey, you gave me the link to download the v3 desktop client for osx ... is there any place I can check if there was a newer release than the one I have installed? (i am aware that it does not have an automatic update system at the moment that is why this version is not officially provided to users)
[2017-11-30 00:42:00] <esden> Just wanted to check if the newer version has less "laggy text updates" (sidenote it definitely works better than the v1 series on osx ... had more issues with that, but the v3 does need some polish... :D )
[2017-11-30 00:49:26] <esden> Just as a note this is what I get in the sidebar of the V3.1.0 desktop client for OSX most of the time when I open the sidebar:
[2017-11-30 00:49:37] <esden>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-11-30 00:49:55] <esden> also I have to click sometimes twice to open a room from the sidebar
[2017-11-30 00:50:29] <esden> and when I type a chat line it does advance the chat window but does not show up until I scroll the chat window or write another text line
[2017-11-30 00:50:51] <esden> these are all small complains ... otherwise it works fine
[2017-11-30 01:50:05] <MadLittleMods> @esden You could check the tags, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/desktop/tags or changelog, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/desktop/blob/master/CHANGELOG.mdThe specific issue you brought up is tracked by https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/desktop/issues/213If you want a newer build that hasn't been released, you can run from source, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/desktop/merge_requests/201
[2017-11-30 10:40:40] <esden> ok thanks :D
[2017-11-30 18:42:10] <hillct> It sems that you’ve got a moderation bot gone amok. Just got a message about something being deleted from here, with no detail of any kind. Totally inappropriate
[2017-11-30 18:51:56] <hillct> There needs to be some significant review of how people are made moderators in this room. What do folks make of this? [<-LINK->] 
[2017-11-30 19:07:32] <cbj4074> Now I'm curious what you said...
[2017-11-30 19:08:02] <cbj4074> Care to share?
[2017-11-30 19:08:07] <hillct> So am I. I haven’t posted in here in 3 months or more
[2017-11-30 19:08:25] <hillct> until I got that random message about something being deleted
[2017-11-30 19:08:29] <cbj4074> Seems probable that the moderator accidentally@d you, instead of whomever posted something completely off-topic.
[2017-11-30 19:08:34] <InternetUnexplorer> hillct: As I said earlier in the PM that you've linked, your message was deleted as it did not appear to be related to the Gitter chat service (which is what this room is for).With over 6,000 people in the room, there are a lot of messages which are posted here on accident. In these cases, myself (and the other moderators) notify those people that their messages are not on topic for the room, so they can find the correct place for their question. Gitter provides no mechanism for viewing deleted messages, and we are not always able to save a copy of every message which we remove.While mistakes are not common, they do happen. If you believe that the message you posted was indeed on topic for this room, feel free to ask it again and I can take a closer look at it.My apologies if you were offended in any way by this action, that was not the intent.
[2017-11-30 19:08:57] <InternetUnexplorer> hillct: The latest message in this room was posted by your account, and appeared to be about an unrelated technology.
[2017-11-30 19:09:27] <cbj4074> If that is in fact the case, you may want to look into your GitHub credentials,@hillct
[2017-11-30 19:09:42] <cbj4074> Revoke your token, change your password, etc.
[2017-11-30 19:10:10] <InternetUnexplorer> While I don't remember the exact content of the message (It was something like 'Is anyone using ...' and a link to a pastebin) it was indeed posted by you.
[2017-11-30 19:10:21] <hillct> InternetUnexplorer: That doesn’t answer the question even slightly. You need to discontinue your moderation activitities until you can properly document your work, and establish a chain of accountability for those moderation activities
[2017-11-30 19:15:29] <cbj4074> If the platform doesn't support said chain of accountability, you're being unreasonable,@hillct. I have no horse in this race, but if you're honestly asking this moderator to take time out of his day to copy/paste every comment he deletes (and I assure you, there aremany, and with good reason), that is an undue burden for somebody who vulunteers his or her time to clean-up the mess in here.
[2017-11-30 19:15:55] <cbj4074> If you'd like to take a crack at moderation, I'm sure there is an ear or two you can bend.
[2017-11-30 19:16:02] <hillct> cbj4074: there are two possibilities. Either, as you say my credentials may have been compromized, or I simply typo’d sometihng posting in the wrong room. I don’t recall a message along the lines of what@InternetUnexplorerdescribes, but either way, if you’re going ot moderate something, it’s critical that you log the activity, so, first, you can demonstrate that the moderation action was taken appropriately, and second, if the poster were a repeat offender, more stringent action could be taken. It seems that Gitter had failed on both these counts. Certainly an area in need of improvement
[2017-11-30 19:16:27] <cbj4074> I agree 100%. Blame Gitter. Not@InternetUnexplorer, though.
[2017-11-30 19:16:38] <cbj4074> AFAIK, he does not work for Gitter.
[2017-11-30 19:16:45] <cbj4074> (please do correct me if I'm wrong)
[2017-11-30 19:17:45] <hillct> cbj4074: association or lack thereof with gitter was never established, but given the room, an association can reasonably be assumed.
[2017-11-30 19:18:32] <cbj4074> Point well-taken.
[2017-11-30 19:19:19] <cbj4074> And please, don't misunderstand, moderation on Gitter is a dumpster-fire at best. Nobody (that I've seen) has ever argued to the contrary.
[2017-11-30 19:19:32] <cbj4074> In fact, one of the founders issued a long, sordid, public apology for issues in relation to it.
[2017-11-30 19:19:54] <hillct> OK, at this point, I don’t want to harp on this issue, having developed reputation systems for discussion environments, going back 20 years, I do have some experience here. There MUST be a log of moderation activities, in order for Gitter to be considered a reliable platform.
[2017-11-30 19:20:21] <cbj4074> I'm quite sure that thereisone, but clearly, the moderator in question lacks access to it.
[2017-11-30 19:21:05] <cbj4074> Again, I agree completely with the premise of your argument and frustration, and am curious what the employees whodohave access to deleted messages will have to say about it.
[2017-11-30 19:21:44] <cbj4074> Anyone who spends time here knows that I call a spade a spade, and have said many unflattering things about the platform, so, take that for what it's worth. :)
[2017-11-30 19:21:44] <hillct> If so (lack of access to logging tools), that’s a problem in and of itself. OK. Enough said. Back to your refularly scheduled programming… :)
[2017-11-30 19:21:54] <cbj4074> 
[2017-11-30 19:21:58] <hillct> thanks for listening
[2017-11-30 19:23:01] <cbj4074> Of course, and I will be staying tuned!
[2017-12-01 10:54:20] <adridadou> hi everyone, I am not sure where to raise bugs but I have an issue with gitter on OSX. If I copy/paste a link to a gist whose content is bigger than the current page, the preview embedded in gitter overflows and I can’t go to the end of the chat anymore
[2017-12-01 10:54:27] <adridadou> and I can’t see what I’m writing anymore
[2017-12-01 10:54:37] <adridadou> I don’t have this issue on the web version, only the desktop one
[2017-12-01 11:48:32] <MadLittleMods> adridadou: Which version of macOS are you using? See [<-LINK->] 
[2017-12-01 11:48:53] <adridadou> HIgh Sierra
[2017-12-01 11:48:56] <adridadou> so that’s me too :)
[2017-12-01 11:48:59] <adridadou> thank you
[2017-12-01 11:49:04] <MadLittleMods> :) no problem
[2017-12-01 20:35:09] <smiller171> Gitter's complete inability to handle notifications if freaking impossible. If I leave it open on my desktop or Chromebook, my phone will never get notifications, no matter how long those other devices have been idle or asleep.
[2017-12-02 10:19:45] <BassemN> When we will be able to signin with Gitlab?

[2017-12-02 21:07:22] <tech4him1> Where is the Gitter source-code hosted?
[2017-12-02 21:08:24] <tech4him1> Ah, nevermind, it was moved to [<-LINK->] .
[2017-12-03 08:12:45] <RaiVaibhav> one basic thing need to if some one add me in private chat , and start spamming, how to leave room or block him .
[2017-12-03 08:12:59] <RaiVaibhav> I tried/leavebut didn't work
[2017-12-04 02:02:28] <urbanintell> Hi everyone first time gitter user here !!!
[2017-12-04 06:01:08] <JustAnotherG> One feature I would like to see, is the ability to filter people who are most recently active in the channel. Is that possible?
[2017-12-04 06:02:12] <JustAnotherG> Are the channel buffers saved locally on each client machine or are they saved on the server? Just wondering how big they are and whether they are user configurable...if anybody knows.
[2017-12-04 06:14:21] <JustAnotherG> Switching to the dark theme causes the visibility of the number of users to be lost.
[2017-12-04 06:29:39] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @gonzela2006The next time we have a release (no eta), [<-LINK->] 
[2017-12-04 06:30:56] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @RaiVaibhavCurrently, there isn't a good way to handle this. You can only hide a one to one room but it will re-appear whenever they other person chats. If someone is harassing you, feel free to send a message tosupport@gitter.imand we can take care of that user
[2017-12-04 06:32:10] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @JustAnotherGYou can track [<-LINK->] 
[2017-12-04 06:32:47] <MadLittleMods> You can't set a room buffer/limit. All messages are archived and accessible
[2017-12-04 06:33:11] <MadLittleMods> You can track [<-LINK->] for the dark theme issue with the roster count
[2017-12-04 06:46:39] <RaiVaibhav> 
[2017-12-04 06:47:33] <JustAnotherG> Thank You for the info

[2017-12-04 09:11:13] <Vamshi99> Hi, I am writing a program to ban a user from a gitter room. I cannot find any api to ban a user. Can anyone help?
[2017-12-04 20:30:30] <mariobehling> Hi, we have changed the name of our repository. Could you help us and rename the gitter chat room as well, please? [<-LINK->] should be [<-LINK->] 
[2017-12-05 00:10:11] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @paulo_dev_twitterThere isn't a way to change your username. It is tied to Twitter with a suffix. It looks like the size parameter might of changed with Twitter. Mind creating an issue? [<-LINK->]

[2017-12-05 13:30:33] <pvanderlinden> Hi I'm struggling with a bug causing gitter to spam me. I have changed every single room I'm in on gitter to only send me notifications on mentions and announcements. I still get emails for unread message from every room I'm in (not a mention or announcment). How do I configure gitter to only send me email about mentions and announcements?
[2017-12-05 14:15:26] <Vamshi99> pvanderlinden: Go to room settings in top right side, then select Notifications  and Change the settings as you like.
[2017-12-05 14:15:48] <pvanderlinden> that doesn't work
[2017-12-05 14:15:57] <pvanderlinden> I have tried that several times
[2017-12-05 14:16:01] <pvanderlinden> it changes it
[2017-12-05 14:16:08] <pvanderlinden> then I still get notifications about everything
[2017-12-05 14:17:10] <pvanderlinden> I even tested it this morning with one  room: went into the room, triple checked that I only get notifications for mentions and announcements. Then cleared all unread messages
[2017-12-05 14:17:32] <pvanderlinden> then got a notification on my email for another random message not being an announcement nor a mention
[2017-12-05 14:18:23] <Vamshi99> I don't have any idea then 
[2017-12-05 14:18:31] <pvanderlinden> just very annoying
[2017-12-05 14:18:59] <pvanderlinden> not sure what to do anymore, but probably should remove my whole account from gitter instead
[2017-12-05 14:58:24] <pvanderlinden> ok, third time today I get notifications about the same room while there hasn't been any announcments or mentions
[2017-12-05 15:11:22] <pvanderlinden> (at least not for me)
[2017-12-05 16:44:07] <InternetUnexplorer> BriandCOUAO: Please note the room description and welcome message; this room is for Gitter support only.
[2017-12-05 17:26:01] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @pvanderlindenThe rooms need to be set to "Mute". Notification emails are tied to unreads which the "Announcements" setting tracks. See [<-LINK->] 
[2017-12-06 10:19:52] <pvanderlinden> Thanks Eric. Unfortunately that makes it impossible to use gitter for me.
[2017-12-06 11:47:18] <jasper22> Hi. It seems very easy but can not find information about it: How I could add 'room' to shortcut list on the right ?
[2017-12-06 11:47:46] <jasper22> I have some 'rooms' there like: Angular and Typescript but I want to add RxJs and didn't find a way to do it :(
[2017-12-06 11:48:59] <jasper22>  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-12-06 11:49:02] <jasper22> like in this screenshot:
[2017-12-06 12:38:24] <jasper22> Ok I found it
[2017-12-06 14:28:04] <Cyric263> Good-Morning!
[2017-12-06 14:37:08] <Cyric263> How come everyone had a black dot in there name; yet I don't?
[2017-12-06 14:37:25] <Cyric263> [ jealous face ]
[2017-12-06 17:24:06] <nickmccurdy> I'm having some usability issues with large code snippets
[2017-12-06 17:24:48] <nickmccurdy> If I try to paste code in a gitter message that's too large, I'm not only unable to send but even if I clear my message I can't send a message until I reload gitter
[2017-12-06 17:25:12] <nickmccurdy> Also if I link to a Gist and the Gist's preview is cut short, there's no visual indicator of this so it seems like the Gist is missing content
[2017-12-06 18:12:47] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @pvanderlindenYou could unsubscribe from emails. There isn't a good solution to this problem yet
[2017-12-06 18:13:47] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @Cyric263Can you share a screenshot of this black dot?
[2017-12-06 18:14:12] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @nickmccurdySee [<-LINK->] 
[2017-12-06 18:35:13] <nickmccurdy> Thanks for the link but I think I have an unrelated issue, the code snippet isn't overlapping with anything it's just not representing the full text of the gist
[2017-12-06 18:35:23] <nickmccurdy> Also not in safari
[2017-12-06 19:25:41] <MadLittleMods> @nickmccurdy hmm, looks like you may be after a scrollable gist. Care to create an issue? https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issuesRelated issue, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/1399
[2017-12-06 21:14:05] <DhawalAgrawal> How can a share an image through gitter??
[2017-12-06 21:14:51] <InternetUnexplorer> DhawalAgrawal: You can use markdown: [<-CODE->] 
[2017-12-06 21:15:07] <InternetUnexplorer> Alternatively, you can drag the image into your browser window to upload it.
[2017-12-06 21:16:44] <DhawalAgrawal> InternetUnexplorer: ok thanks
[2017-12-08 13:16:32] <m4tr1k> Hi everyone, I think I discover a bug on your app and I would like to report, any devs here to talk?
[2017-12-08 13:19:16] <m4tr1k> Ok I will talk here, I will share my problem
[2017-12-08 13:22:54] <m4tr1k> So I usually like to code with some music, with Spotify. I have a keyboard with custom keys to pause, play, next music, etc. The problem is that when I was talking to another person and I wanted to pause the music, I clicked on the button and the app crashed. It crashes every single time. If I want to pause the music, I can't stay on Gitter, because it will crash. Hope you understand my problem and I would like someone to try and see if the problem is only mine or it's actually a bug. Thank you
[2017-12-08 13:24:09] <m4tr1k> Gitter for Windows is what I am using
[2017-12-08 17:30:08] <nickmccurdy> m4tr1k: That does sound like a legit bug, maybe submit a request ( [<-LINK->] As a workaround I would either just use Gitter in another browser windows or use your media keys to pause/unpause/etc spotify without switching apps
[2017-12-08 20:05:48] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @m4tr1k@nickmccurdyYou can track [<-LINK->] 
[2017-12-08 20:29:02] <m4tr1k> Good to know this is already tracked, but it seems it is a bug from long time ago, and it's not fixed yet
[2017-12-10 03:19:33] <billions2013_twitter> Any indication when it will be fixed?
[2017-12-11 09:27:46] <lars20070> I have added a Collaborator to my private repository. (He accepted.) But he cannot be added to the corresponding (private)  gitter chat room. When I try to add him, I get”Forbidden”.
[2017-12-11 10:09:11] <lars20070> PS: He can access public chat rooms without problem.
[2017-12-11 11:07:00] <jayvdb>  [<-LINK->] - lots of gitter there ;)
[2017-12-11 11:09:49] <jayvdb>  [<-LINK->] if anyone wants to improve it
[2017-12-11 20:39:44] <MadLittleMods>  December 11, 2017 3:27 AM @lars20070 When you invite someone to a room, we check from their perspective whether they can join. They probably need to add private repo scope
[2017-12-11 20:39:55] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @jayvdbThanks for the links!
[2017-12-12 02:13:15] <rhunter> Hi folks. I used GitHub to authenticate and noticed the GitHub's OAuth permission-check screen showed a default avatar for the Gitter app: [<-LINK->] 
[2017-12-12 02:14:29] <rhunter> Oops, I messed up the Markdown for an inline image there. I meant:
[2017-12-12 02:18:14] <rhunter> Anyway it's clearly not that big a deal but I guess it'd be an easy fix for someone with permissions for the GitHub app (maybe the relevant settings screen would be under [<-LINK->] )
[2017-12-12 02:31:41] <rhunter> To contextualise the avatar, here's a screenshot from fresh install of the desktop app:
[2017-12-12 04:28:31] <MadLittleMods> Hey @rhunter, thanks for the report! Mind creating an issue to track it? https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues I pinged someone with admin access to the org to update the the image though.I wonder when this changed  It used to use the org avatar, https://github.com/gitterHQ
[2017-12-12 05:51:34] <rhunter> MadLittleMods: Sure. [<-LINK->] is open for tracking.
[2017-12-12 06:50:17] <MadLittleMods> Thanks :)
[2017-12-12 09:13:54] <Juanlu001> hi! I'm trying to create a new community based on an organization with restricted access, but this article [<-LINK->] doesn't help. Is there an alternative to removing the permission restrictions? can be at least done temporarily?
[2017-12-12 10:26:52] <MadLittleMods> Juanlu001: Like the article suggests, instead of removing all restrictions, you can instead "Manually grant access". Does that work for you?
[2017-12-12 11:34:58] <Juanlu001> dammit, didn't see it on first sight. thanks@MadLittleMods!
[2017-12-12 20:45:42] <sfcgeorge> Scrolling conversations is often really laggy. It seems to be due to code blocks with language syntax highlighting (great feature, but please make it faster).
[2017-12-12 20:47:09] <sfcgeorge> Reactions to messages would be really nice as most other chat apps have it now, hell even Github does on issues. Otherwise you get lots of "Thanks" message clutter, or feel too worried to say thanks because you don't want to bother all the other people in the room.
[2017-12-12 20:49:37] <sfcgeorge> The "compose mode" isn't persistent between reloads and defaults to chat mode, so I keep sending half messages which is annoying.
[2017-12-12 20:50:58] <sfcgeorge> When I come back to a channel it often takes me to a random scrolled place. And the unread messages take forever to clear; you have to constantly scroll and wiggle your mouse to get it to notice you've read stuff.
[2017-12-12 22:13:51] <MadLittleMods> @sfcgeorge Are you noticing the slow down with Gists or markdown code fences? Are you in the desktop client (which OS, version)?You can track https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/365 for reactions. [<-CODE->] Is the scroll position actually random? I notice it is sometimes scrolled up just a bit (still a bug). See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/1504#note_38208667The unread fade transition has a 1 second delay which may be contributing to what you perceive as clearing, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/599aa0d3fd638d43eef0f9c0d8758481f592e1f3/public/js/views/chat/chatItemView.less#L199
[2017-12-13 09:16:08] <sfcgeorge> MadLittleMods: Thanks for the responses.I used the +1 button in GitLab to vote on reactions  
Just using the web app in the latest Safari 11 on macOS, and just Markdown code blocks.
Scroll position, for example I came back to this chat after posting my message and there were no new messages since, yet it was scrolled a few messages back.
If there are several pages worth of unread messages then often I can scroll past a block and they don't get marked as read. I have to slowly and methodically scroll a little at a time and wiggle my mouse around. Feels like I'm herding sheep each morning before I've even had coffee. Well, a second coffee, but it's still not enough.
[2017-12-13 14:57:31] <GrosSacASac> How can I send an image ?
[2017-12-13 14:59:15] <GrosSacASac> ok copy paste works, but I had no feedback that my image was indeed uploading, 10 seconds later
[2017-12-13 14:59:20] <sfcgeorge> Drag and drop it onto the chat window. In some browsers it takes 2 attempts.
[2017-12-13 14:59:50] <GrosSacASac> you should add feedback that uploading started
[2017-12-13 15:00:26] <GrosSacASac> yet another example of a feature that was tested on high tier computer configuration but not the rest
[2017-12-13 18:34:52] <MadLittleMods> GrosSacASac: The progress bar is along the textarea [<-LINK->] 
[2017-12-13 18:41:35] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @sfcgeorgeImproving the unread horizon is definitely on the list, see [<-LINK->] and [<-LINK->] 
[2017-12-13 19:36:37] <sfcgeorge> MadLittleMods: Great, thanks.
[2017-12-13 20:51:35] <GrosSacASac> I didn't see any progress bar, I was using the gitter inside the webpack site
[2017-12-14 00:50:31] <jkentjnr> Hi there - I'm wanting to use glitter.im for an application but it is unlikely my users will have github accounts and not all will have twitter accounts.  Do you have other authentication options?
[2017-12-14 02:53:35] <nickmccurdy> As far as I'm aware no, what's the use case?
[2017-12-14 02:53:48] <nickmccurdy> While Gitter in nice you'd probably be better off with Slack or something similar in this scenario
[2017-12-14 06:28:11] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @jkentjnrOnly GitHub and Twitter at the moment. Next up is signing in with GitLab (future)
[2017-12-15 21:40:04] <elorest> I use gitter a lot but recently switched over to linux instead of OSX. In the gitter desktop app the font is unreadably small making the desktop app useless. Is there anyway to change the font size or a conf file I could edit?
[2017-12-16 00:52:08] <bryevdv> FYI with "dark" theme, Repo Info Tab is unreadable
[2017-12-16 00:52:17] <bryevdv>  [<-LINK->]

[2017-12-16 03:15:19] <elorest> I've read those solutions but it says to..Open the dev tools via the Gitter context menu and run the following to zoom the whole window: [<-CODE->] 
[2017-12-16 03:15:41] <elorest> MadLittleMods: How do I open dev tools via the Gitter context menu?
[2017-12-16 03:16:37] <MadLittleMods> elorest:  [<-LINK->] 
[2017-12-16 03:24:26] <elorest> Awesome.
[2017-12-16 03:24:30] <elorest> That worked.
[2017-12-16 03:24:43] <elorest> Presumably I'd need to do this everytime I open gitter?
[2017-12-16 03:28:45] <elorest> Where would index.js be located? ON the first issue he fixed it more permanently by modifying that.
[2017-12-16 03:29:07] <MadLittleMods> elorest: Run from source [<-LINK->] 
[2017-12-16 06:35:46] <elorest> Ok. Thanks.
[2017-12-18 13:23:21] <bryevdv> Please add a users @ name on the mobile app. Only their display name is available (can’t even click their icon to get a profile e.g) so if a users display name and username are different enough to thwart auto completion (happens very often), it’s impossible to @ mention them
[2017-12-19 13:22:19] <Herrner> is copying a message as markdown-source (as described in [<-LINK->] ) still possible? It doesn't seem to work here.
[2017-12-19 18:35:25] <pgnd> fyi - a display prob with github issue display in gitter activity pane.I posted a "postcss-next"-related issue at github.  In appears in the ACTIVITY pane, as expected, at [<-LINK->] .However, the issue display on gitter fails to correctly parse/use the collapsible  "<display><summary>...</summary><display>" tags --  i.e., looks OK on github ; not on gitter.
[2017-12-20 01:38:47] <daddycardona> is there a way i can make the font bigger on the app on my computer? I searched and just get glitter or this chat
[2017-12-20 21:38:10] <janpapenbrock> Is the Gitter app for android officially dead? Maybe kt
[2017-12-20 21:39:49] <janpapenbrock> ... Maybe it should be marked as such, if it is.  I just installed and could not login with Github. Although the login to Github itself worked, the app doesn't care at all.
[2017-12-21 13:10:33] <XiaoCheng123> anyone can tell me why the Axure Components for element-ui has not found?
[2017-12-21 13:10:45] <XiaoCheng123> for help
[2017-12-21 13:13:14] <XiaoCheng123> it always can not be found 404 on github
[2017-12-21 13:22:48] <Herrner> is anyone from gitter responding to these messages?
[2017-12-21 13:26:07] <XiaoCheng123> oh,i am so sorry ,but i do not how to do.i am a chinese student.can you tell me which community i should ask?
[2017-12-21 17:12:33] <daddycardona> 404 means that the site is down or they took it off so that site is no longer there
[2017-12-21 17:16:56] <daddycardona> XiaoCheng123: 
[2017-12-21 17:17:16] <daddycardona> so that means you got the wrong site or they took it down ;)
[2017-12-21 17:18:35] <daddycardona> also if you click on the world you can search for freecodecamp/chinese@XiaoCheng123
[2017-12-21 17:19:08] <daddycardona> Herrner: gitter does not respond i guess lol
[2017-12-21 22:37:06] <CodeJoule> Hello, quick question:  How do I change the time format so it's a 12hr clock?
[2017-12-22 19:29:05] <CodeJoule> Every time I minimize Gitter, it starts to make beeping noises at me.
[2017-12-23 07:32:50] <rokf> CodeTrooperMC: It needs attention . Maybe those are its mating sounds.
[2017-12-25 09:39:21] <Lectem> Hi guys, I created a new room a few days ago, but it ended up being a Community. I would like to associate the Lobby room with my repository, is that possible ?

[2017-12-26 14:19:51] <mariobehling> vaibhavsingh97: @gabru-mdDo you find any way, we can get our chat room back?
[2017-12-26 14:20:08] <gabru-md> not until now.
[2017-12-26 14:20:15] <gabru-md> but we are still looking for it
[2017-12-26 14:21:06] <vaibhavsingh97> Nope, Looking into it
[2017-12-26 15:05:23] <mariobehling> vaibhavsingh97: @gabru-mdI submitted a support request to re-instate the room.
[2017-12-26 15:05:42] <vaibhavsingh97> 
[2017-12-26 15:06:00] <gabru-md>  great
[2017-12-26 15:06:06] <gabru-md> i hope it is done soon
[2017-12-26 15:06:19] <vaibhavsingh97> Yes!

[2017-12-26 15:07:40] <STEdirisuriya> vaibhavsingh97: That's I said it was delete by someone
[2017-12-27 15:26:38] <Sabata02> hi guys how can i include images in my chats?
[2017-12-27 15:27:34] <gabru-md> Juat drag and drop
[2017-12-27 15:28:11] <Sabata02> ok thanks
[2017-12-27 21:56:50] <pydo> Is there anyway to zoom (increase text size) on the linux version of the Gitter desktop app? I triedCtrl - +andscroll - +but neither of them does anything. I checked the support page but nothing showed up [<-LINK->] 
[2017-12-28 11:08:40] <antonioaltamura> guys I set notification "only for mention" INDIVIDUALLY for each room I subscribed (there is no general setting??) and STILL I get mail flooded by gitter notifications daily..what am I supposed to do?
[2017-12-28 17:03:40] <jonasstein> Hi, it would be great to have a "Delete my account" button after logged in as the user. I had to send now a ticket to the support.
[2017-12-28 17:05:35] <jonasstein> Another feature would be to run the server in Germany, because the user data is protected there better by law than in US for example. (at least on the paper ;-)
[2017-12-30 02:54:58] <troxor> Does anyone here know what to do with Gitter rooms that correspond to transferred repositories? I did a bit of repo shuffling, and the gitter room still refers to the old organization name
[2017-12-30 11:08:45] <xispa> Good morning, is there a way to disable by default the preview of links? I know there is the "collapse" option, but I'd like links to always appear "collapsed" for everyone
[2017-12-30 20:04:37] <grahamperrin> markandsbhatt: this room is for help with Gitter, not Xamarin.
[2017-12-30 20:12:08] <mariobehling> Hi, how long does it take for Gitter to respond to support requests usually? I understand that there was Christmas, but it would be good to get an answer to our request to reinstate our channel with 1k devs that was deleted by someone. Should we recreate that channel and try to add the devs manually or would it be possible to undelete the channel?
[2017-12-31 18:42:15] <jonasstein> mariobehling: I wanted to delete my gitter account after I was disappointed by gitter. I am waiting now already since dec 28th for the support to delete my account. If they would allow users to delete accounts on their own, they would save a lot of manpower to respond to questions like yours. I expected this here to be a support chat, but no support member responded yet.

[2018-01-02 16:01:40] <MadLittleMods> @vaibhavsingh97 I took two weeks off and didn't touch any support tickets. I will be taking a look at all of them today.Usually it takes a couple days.

[2018-01-02 21:14:55] <ski7777> Hi
[2018-01-02 21:15:10] <ski7777> I just typed my own name in the gitter desktop client
[2018-01-02 21:15:18] <ski7777> Then I had two sidebars
[2018-01-02 21:15:46] <ski7777> After typing my name in the new sidebar I had three of them
[2018-01-02 21:15:50] <ski7777> And so on...
[2018-01-02 21:15:58] <ski7777> Is this a bug or a feature?
[2018-01-02 21:16:21] <Benwebdev> bug that turned into a feature lol.
[2018-01-02 21:16:30] <ski7777> :D
[2018-01-02 21:16:44] <ski7777> Is it alredy reported somewhere?
[2018-01-02 21:16:57] <ski7777> It is not a feature
[2018-01-02 21:16:58] <Benwebdev> I hate how the gitter mobile app shows display names instead of username so you can never get tagging right.
[2018-01-02 21:17:38] <ski7777> When opening another page in one of the sidebars all sidebars right of it will close 
[2018-01-02 21:17:38] <Benwebdev> if there username is different to the display name it's almost impossible to tag

[2018-01-03 03:33:39] <wxl> correct me if i'm wrong but it seems there's no way to link to a commit via hash as it does on GitHub?
[2018-01-03 04:23:05] <daddycardona> MadLittleMods: that didn't help me at all sorry I wanted it for the app to be able to do this but it can't

[2018-01-03 16:56:35] <wxl> MadLittleMods: yeah i eventually figured that out after looking at the GitHub-flavored md dox. Thanks,
[2018-01-03 20:48:13] <rkitover> MadLittleMods: I uninstalled the desktop client and made a "Chrome Web App" for the website, works much much better and doesn't have the stupid bug, this is the method: [<-LINK->]

[2018-01-05 06:26:07] <danijar> Hello Gitter team, I recently created the Gitter community active_inference and am now trying to link it to my Github organization active-inference. I read through the FAQ but couldn't find how to do this. I was not ask whether I want to link the community to Github when I created it.
[2018-01-05 08:01:02] <MadLittleMods> @danijar There is a link "do you want to start a community for one of your github projects?" on the first page of the create community flow.There isn't a way to associate a community with a GitHub repo after the fact. Send a message to support@gitter.im with the details
[2018-01-05 14:35:06] <limitlessloop> Hello. Is anyone aware of a bug with the desktop app for Gitter on Mac which cause the screen to become unreadable when someone posts a link to a gist?

[2018-01-05 19:28:09] <bkmdev> Hi, I am using the web version of gitter.im on OSX HS + Chrome v63.0.x but am having an issue with notifications not doing anything when clicked on, normally other webapps', ex: irccloud, notifications bring the tab in question back into focus in the foreground.
[2018-01-05 19:28:17] <bkmdev> Is this currently broken?
[2018-01-05 19:28:51] <bkmdev> or a known issue?
[2018-01-05 19:31:08] <bkmdev> I've looked in support.gitter.im and topics but didn't see this metnioned
[2018-01-05 19:32:17] <bkmdev> would also be nice to have notification sounds too :/

[2018-01-05 20:22:56] <bkmdev> hmm, strange, seems to have randomly started working now

[2018-01-08 01:25:52] <MLHKevinTeam4> Hey everyone, looking to login into the windows gitter app w/o entering my github info in the program window. Currently using this tutorial but am unable to enter anything into the console w/enter. Am I doing something wrong? [<-LINK->] 
[2018-01-09 19:12:13] <MadLittleMods> @MLHKevinTeam4 Probably not doing anything wrong. I have experienced that in the past and not really sure how it resolved itself. [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
[2018-01-09 22:03:08] <mmynsted> I looked over the topics and there seems to be no answer to this --> [<-LINK->] 
[2018-01-09 22:03:19] <mmynsted> Is there a way to get a link to a particular message?
[2018-01-09 22:07:35] <cbj4074> Yep:   [<-LINK->] 
[2018-01-09 22:08:08] <mmynsted> How did you do that?
[2018-01-09 22:11:28] <cbj4074> On desktop anyway, if you mouse-over the timestamp to the right of the message, it saysAlt-Click to quote
[2018-01-09 22:11:42] <cbj4074> And when you do, you can see the format of the link it inserts into the input field.
[2018-01-09 22:11:58] <cbj4074> I suspect you could snatch the same URL and paste it anywhere on the web, if that is your use-case.
[2018-01-09 23:24:11] <mmynsted> oh, I guess I need the desktop version . . .
[2018-01-10 12:01:19] <mydigitalself> you should be able to do it on the web app as well, just not mobile
[2018-01-10 12:03:55] <MLHKevinTeam4> MadLittleMods: Tried your solution. Unfortunately, the program rewrites the entire file to default  undoing any of my changes. Any suggestions?
[2018-01-10 13:48:16] <mydigitalself> MLHKevinTeam4: was Gitter entirely closed/quit no processes running when you tried those things?
[2018-01-10 15:18:24] <mmynsted> I see it in the desktop version.  Not in web, non-mobile, version.
[2018-01-10 16:26:31] <InternetUnexplorer> mmynsted: Try double-tapping the message timestamp in the mobile version. It should open a link to that message in your browser, which you can copy.
[2018-01-10 17:53:09] <mmynsted> Thanks@InternetUnexplorerthat seems to be it
[2018-01-11 05:11:45] <MLHKevinTeam4> mydigitalself: Yeah it was. Seems to overwrite on launch.

[2018-01-12 03:10:15] <Luxray5474> Open devtools and change font size

[2018-01-12 17:10:05] <Dorus> Hi
[2018-01-12 17:10:38] <Dorus> Quick question: Hoes does one moderate a gitter channel? We got a spammy user (not real spam, but he repeats the same question nobody answers over and over)
[2018-01-12 17:11:01] <Dorus> Anyone asking anything gets a @ name + 3 pages of code that he has a question about
[2018-01-12 17:11:21] <MadLittleMods> Dorus: As an admin, you can remove the message or ban them/ban @user
[2018-01-12 17:11:41] <Dorus> How do i find the admins? Are that the people that own the repository the channel is associated with?
[2018-01-12 17:12:25] <MadLittleMods> Dorus: Most likely. Depending on the room size, you sometimes see black bars under peoples avatars in the "People" roster in the top-right
[2018-01-12 17:15:25] <Dorus> MadLittleMods: It's fairly active, we got around 100 people watching and people asking questions daily
[2018-01-12 17:15:30] <Dorus> However i cannot find anyone with a black bar
[2018-01-12 17:15:49] <MadLittleMods> Dorus: Which room is it?
[2018-01-12 17:15:59] <Dorus>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-01-12 17:17:01] <MadLittleMods> Dorus: Anyone with push access to the repo is an admin
[2018-01-12 17:17:23] <Dorus> Ah, i see if i can talk to people that have that. Thanks :)
[2018-01-12 17:17:48] <Dorus> Can anyone without push access get access to the gitter admin?@MadLittleMods
[2018-01-12 17:17:58] <Dorus> I wonder if they can add me without giving push access
[2018-01-12 17:19:35] <MadLittleMods> Dorus: Yes, they can add you as a manual explicit admin
[2018-01-12 17:21:23] <Dorus> Ok, thanks again. We never had much issues in the last few years that i'm in it (one pm spammer that the gitter admins dealt with), but the people with push access are not very active on the gitter so we have zero moderation around usually.
[2018-01-12 17:27:41] <Dorus> Anyway i'm going to /part. Bye :)
[2018-01-12 17:27:52] <MadLittleMods> 
[2018-01-12 19:10:34] <apetresc> Question about the IRC bridge: I can't figure out how I'm supposed to interpret the userlist of a channel. It's very often the case that someone will be chatting in the room and not show up as being in the IRC channel. Is it buggy, or is there some other semantics for the userlist that I'm missing?
[2018-01-12 19:38:17] <MadLittleMods> apetresc: Only the first ~30 will be in that list [<-ISSUE->] 
[2018-01-12 19:44:31] <apetresc> Oh interesting
[2018-01-12 19:45:00] <apetresc> Heh, shows how much love the IRC bridge gets, that a simple pagination bug has been open for over 2 years :P
[2018-01-12 19:45:53] <apetresc> Yeah I hadn't noticed that there was always exactly 30 people in every room so I guess this must be it. Although strangely it's not thefirst30 alphabetically, I have the full a-z range
[2018-01-12 19:50:53] <MadLittleMods> apetresc: Probably in order they joined the room or how old their user is
[2018-01-12 19:52:46] <apetresc> Aah that makes sense
[2018-01-12 19:53:17] <apetresc> Maybe if I have time this weekend I'll try for a fix, I suppose. It sounds like it should be pretty trivial
[2018-01-12 19:53:34] <MadLittleMods> apetresc: Trickle method 
[2018-01-13 01:59:36] <pvtennant> what file is the trickle method in?
[2018-01-13 02:00:36] <MadLittleMods> pvtennant: It's not implemented yet. Just an idea on how to get people who chat in a room in the IRC roster, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-01-13 02:02:30] <pvtennant> oh, okay! cool thanks!
[2018-01-13 02:06:17] <pvtennant> is any one else having their message not pop up?
[2018-01-13 02:06:38] <MadLittleMods> pvtennant: I deleted your message, please stay on topic: Gitter support
[2018-01-13 08:39:20] <MLHKevinTeam4> MadLittleMods: So about my last question-- is there anything I can do? The file is being overwritten on launch so I'm unable to input that token code in the .json file
[2018-01-13 10:07:35] <MadLittleMods> @MLHKevinTeam4 I'm not sure why it would overwrite it, it reads the settings in first https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/desktop/blob/713189dba636eda37d5c38f3dd6a7f4536beca48/nwapp/utils/settings.js#L50You could run the app from source https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/desktop
[2018-01-16 03:53:00] <georgewsinger> Question:Is there any way to force notifications to push on Android, even if you have Gitter open on your desktop?

[2018-01-17 23:12:16] <monedadigitalmg_twitter> Hi! How can I unistall Gitter from my pc?
[2018-01-17 23:27:19] <MadLittleMods> monedadigitalmg_twitter: You can follow the steps here [<-LINK->] 
[2018-01-18 10:38:36] <ryansmith94> Hey! Would be really cool if there was a way to add tags to users to show that they're admins/moderators/etc I'm assuming that has been discussed before somewhere
[2018-01-18 10:40:01] <ryansmith94> Sometimes when people external to our company reply on Gitter it looks like they're representing the company/contributors which makes us a little uneasy at times haha
[2018-01-18 13:39:53] <kbrock> Are others having trouble with the gitter.app? It is showing me the red message with the click here for retry
[2018-01-18 13:40:07] <kbrock> chrome seems to be working fine. (I'm on mac)
[2018-01-18 18:09:19] <MadLittleMods>  January 18, 2018 4:38 AM @ryansmith94  There is some admin/contributor indicator in the roster in the right sidebar but not very useful when the latest people aren't there, see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/1365 and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/124Feel free to create a new issue about adding some indicator to the message view, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues
[2018-01-18 18:10:06] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @kbrockStill having problems?
[2018-01-18 18:11:03] <ryansmith94> Awesome thanks@MadLittleMods
[2018-01-18 18:22:20] <MadLittleMods> ryansmith94: Thanks for the issue [<-LINK->] 
[2018-01-18 18:24:22] <ryansmith94> No worries, those other two issues were relevant so thanks for the links, just don't think they were exactly what I was looking for :)
[2018-01-18 18:24:50] <ryansmith94> Thanks for changing the title, that's much better
[2018-01-18 18:25:56] <ryansmith94> And reformatting the description, not sure about changing my UK English to US English though haha ;)
[2018-01-18 18:35:23] <kbrock> MadLittleMods: thnx. After trying a few times, I had to login again and all is working now (fixed ~10:00am)
[2018-01-19 16:59:55] <fulldecent> Gitter Bug, I can't create a room
[2018-01-19 17:00:00] <fulldecent> and the UI is broken
[2018-01-19 17:01:24] <fulldecent>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-01-19 17:57:20] <MadLittleMods> fulldecent: Answered here [<-LINK->] 
[2018-01-19 22:38:18] <dfolch> How do I unhide a room?
[2018-01-20 01:00:35] <mgambrell> Does anyone know how to remove real names display from my user interface? I don't like seeing people's real names, only their github usernames
[2018-01-20 08:28:24] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @dfolchThe other person needs to send you a message or you need to manually visit it again
[2018-01-20 08:29:04] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @mgambrellThere isn't an option in the UI to hide them. You could use your own custom CSS with a browser extension
[2018-01-20 08:36:28] <mgambrell> ok thanks
[2018-01-20 14:47:05] <dfolch> MadLittleMods: That works. Thanks.
[2018-01-20 14:47:08] <dfolch> Related question (I think): Can I see a list of all my rooms (hidden or not)?
[2018-01-21 15:18:12] <MLHKevinTeam4> Anyone know how to generate a new gitter developer token?
[2018-01-21 23:16:31] <domoritz> Is there a way to rename a community as an admin?
[2018-01-22 11:03:34] <janisozaur> Hi, it looks like a room we created was a generic room with integrations added later on. Whenever we post issue numbers (like#14) it looks for issues in whole organisation, but the other room we have was set up for a specific repository and issue number take you directly to those repo's issue page. Can the room type be changed?
[2018-01-22 16:38:43] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @dfolchYou could use the API [<-LINK->] 
[2018-01-22 16:40:02] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @MLHKevinTeam4There isn't a way to regenerate a new token in the UI yet but you can send a email tosupport@gitter.im. You can track [<-LINK->] 
[2018-01-22 16:41:15] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @domoritzThere isn't a way to rename a community after the fact. You can send an email tosupport@gitter.imwith the details. [<-LINK->] best tracks this issue
[2018-01-22 16:42:24] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @janisozaurSend an email tosupport@gitter.imwith the details. Link the room and the repo please
[2018-01-22 16:51:25] <domoritz> Thank you@MadLittleMods
[2018-01-22 18:23:06] <dfolch> MadLittleMods: First time using the API. I got it working with [<-CODE->] . Thanks.
[2018-01-23 16:14:28] <TheJaredWilcurt> MadLittleMods: Spam: [<-LINK->] 
[2018-01-23 22:00:51] <ali-hk> Does the gitter API  support refreshing tokens via [<-LINK->] ?
[2018-01-24 08:13:43] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @TheJaredWilcurtThanks the report. They have been taken care of
[2018-01-24 08:14:21] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @ali-hknot yet. You can track [<-LINK->] 
[2018-01-24 08:27:40] <ali-hk> MadLittleMods: I was actually referring to OAuth App authorization and the OAuth token refresh flow. Sounds like that's talking about the Personal Access Token? I may be misunderstanding.
[2018-01-24 08:30:13] <MadLittleMods> ali-hk: In either case, there isn't a way to refresh or delete
[2018-01-24 08:31:18] <ali-hk> Got it :) thanks!
[2018-01-24 22:22:51] <ericniebler> I'd love to user Gitter for my open-source project (github.com/ericniebler/coronet). I'm trying to create a community around the coronet repo. I go here: https://gitter.im/home/explore#createcommunity and click "github projects?" to build a community around coronet. I click "my repos" and select ericniebler/coronet. When I click "Next," I get: "Allow private repo access on the GitHub org or make your org membership public. We are forbidden from seeing what is going on."I don't know what this means. There is no GitHub org involved here. It's my personal account. coronet is a public repro with public contributors. Why doesn't this work?
[2018-01-25 00:27:14] <MadLittleMods> ericniebler: See [<-LINK->] 
[2018-01-25 00:30:47] <ericniebler> Oh wow. Thanks.
[2018-01-25 17:47:45] <PartyImp> I have a very serious question, Is it pronounced "git-ter" or "jitter" ?
[2018-01-25 20:17:30] <MadLittleMods> PartyImp: "git-ter"
[2018-01-25 20:18:16] <PartyImp> bueno, thanks!
[2018-01-25 21:31:47] <nafg> Has anything changed in gitter in a long time?
[2018-01-25 21:55:04] <MadLittleMods> nafg: No, there hasn't been any deployments. We are currently working on getting deployments going again 
[2018-01-26 17:51:06] <ronnyek> someone appears to have a bot running, just spitting out garbledegoup in one or more channels (primarily the angular related channels)
[2018-01-26 17:51:51] <ronnyek> goes by the name of@TUSPONGPON
[2018-01-26 17:52:08] <ronnyek> as soon as I saw it appear in other channels, someone recommended I leave that information here
[2018-01-26 17:57:29] <ronnyek> oh nice its apparently here now too
[2018-01-26 17:59:44] <ronnyek> apologies if its presence is because I mentioned it... but figure its just gonna get worse if there isnt a way to remove more broadly
[2018-01-26 18:57:39] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @ronnyekCan you give some permalinks to some messages?
[2018-01-26 18:57:55] <ronnyek> yep
[2018-01-26 18:58:32] <TUSPONGPON> keyboard F13@ronnyek
[2018-01-26 18:58:35] <ronnyek> haha
[2018-01-26 18:58:36] <ronnyek> theres one
[2018-01-26 18:58:48] <ronnyek> how can I get permalinks from the message
[2018-01-26 18:59:11] <MadLittleMods> ronnyek: Alt+click the timestamp in the top-right of every message (or click and copy the URL in the address bar)
[2018-01-26 18:59:41] <ronnyek>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-01-26 19:00:14] <ronnyek>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-01-26 19:00:52] <MadLittleMods> Thanks@ronnyek, they have been taken care of ;)
[2018-01-26 19:01:32] <ronnyek> cool yeah I coudl see how what it was spitting out was not terribly disruptive or constant spamming, just annoying because it was like random words
[2018-01-27 18:09:48] <ShawnTalbert> Hi folks. I cannot find any sort of help link or way to provide feedback to gitter. It's very frustrating
[2018-01-27 18:10:14] <ShawnTalbert> I just had toguessthat a gitter channel named 'gitter' might exist
[2018-01-27 18:16:19] <ShawnTalbert> Is this the right place to ask a question about the product?
[2018-01-27 22:28:10] <GoddessMaat> Yes
[2018-01-28 17:35:10] <sashahilton00> Hi guys, a quick question, if I transfer ownership of a repo, I assume the chatroom will also be transferred to the new owner. If this is the case, will the old chatroom links be redirected to the new one automatically?
[2018-01-28 22:37:05] <rodrigortz> How do you delete conversations in the app?
[2018-01-29 00:00:05] <rodrigortz> Anyone else?
[2018-01-29 02:11:30] <ahojukka5> We are having an issue when trying add new room to our (assumed) community JuliaFEM. When I click "new room", I see a dialog adding new room maybe for half second, #createroom tag in url, but after a short time it disappears and having another page adding new community, and #newcommunity tag in url. It's unclear for me what is happening, why I cannot add new room and how to do it. If I try to create new community JuliaFEM instead, I cannot do that either, there's a red ! telling that something is wrong, without a explanation about what is the problem, but I assume that cannot create community JuliaFEM because it already exists. However, I have no idea how to overcome this problem and have a new room created under JuliaFEM?
[2018-01-29 06:00:15] <kysnm_twitter> I would like to switch the account.How can I logout (signout) from Gitter.app on my macbook?
[2018-01-29 07:36:04] <karl-gustav> Am I right in assuming that edits of messages are not sendt in the streaming API (i.e. [<-LINK->] )
[2018-01-29 08:43:53] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @sashahilton00See [<-LINK->] 
[2018-01-29 08:50:30] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @rodrigortzIf you are on the web/desktop app, click the 3 dot dropdown icon in the top-right of every message -> Delete. If you are using the Android, app double tap a message and empty it out. On the iOS app, I think there is an explicit option if hold the message or tap
[2018-01-29 08:52:59] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @ahojukka5If the create community flow is coming up, it means we don't see you as an admin of any community. Ensure the Gitter private repo scope is added to your personal GitHub account and org (it also helps if your org membership is public, [<-LINK->] )
[2018-01-29 08:53:54] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @kysnm_twitterThe sign out option is in the menu bar icon dropdown at the top (right side)
[2018-01-29 08:54:47] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @karl-gustavMessage edits go through this endpoint [<-LINK->] 
[2018-01-29 08:55:25] <karl-gustav> MadLittleMods: I meant listening for edit events, not sending them
[2018-01-29 09:00:16] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @karl-gustavCurrently only new messages go through that endpoint ( [<-LINK->] )
[2018-01-29 09:36:14] <karl-gustav> MadLittleMods: That url gave a 404 since the gitter-stream repo is not public, but I belive you nonetheless :-)
[2018-01-29 13:24:38] <kysnm_twitter>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-01-29 13:24:43] <kysnm_twitter> MadLittleMods: In Web, I know in the menu bar icon.

[2018-01-29 13:26:20] <kysnm_twitter> But, App for mac is not in the menu bar icon. [<-LINK->] 
[2018-01-29 17:47:16] <MadLittleMods> kysnm_twitter: See [<-LINK->] 
[2018-01-30 00:38:03] <kysnm_twitter> MadLittleMods: Thank you! I'm sorry for misunderstanding.
[2018-01-30 21:52:54] <h4ck3rm1k3> Howdy mods, I love gitter
[2018-01-30 21:53:51] <h4ck3rm1k3> was just wondering what you do when you have non-free software hosted on github using gitter? I was under the impression that the particular project was free software but im now very dissappointed.
[2018-01-30 21:56:37] <h4ck3rm1k3>  [<-ISSUE->] 
[2018-01-31 00:49:56] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @h4ck3rm1k3You can use Gitter for whatever you want. It isn't restricted to any particular type of project
[2018-01-31 11:33:02] <h4ck3rm1k3> I was as, many other people were, really misled to think this was open source :(
[2018-01-31 15:20:56] <InternetUnexplorer> h4ck3rm1k3: Gitterisopen source. If you're referring to the repository you linked, you're in the wrong room; this room is for support relating to Gitter itself.
[2018-01-31 15:23:39] <InternetUnexplorer>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-02-04 01:09:44] <GoddessMaat> Okay thank you
[2018-02-04 17:54:26] <ShawnTalbert> I'm running the gitter app on linux... anyone know keyboard shortcuts (i.e to navigate between rooms?)
[2018-02-04 17:54:53] <ShawnTalbert> Also, the ALT+Click shortcut to link to a specific message does NOT seem to work in the linux version of the app
[2018-02-04 18:11:22] <GoddessMaat> No but i just switch back and forth im not really sure but i keep trying
[2018-02-04 18:44:45] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @ShawnTalbertYou can track [<-LINK->] 
[2018-02-04 20:05:46] <ShawnTalbert> how do you switch back and forsth@GoddessMaat, with the mouse? I don't see any keyboard shortcuts for that.@MadLittleModsThanks! Maybe if I disable that shortcut on Cinnamon it'll work here..
[2018-02-04 20:10:24] <ShawnTalbert>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-02-04 20:11:35] <ShawnTalbert> OK, at least for cinnamon I could just go change Windows->Behavior->Special key to move and resize windows
[2018-02-04 20:12:40] <ShawnTalbert> still doesn't help me for navigating between chat rooms :(
[2018-02-04 20:14:32] <ShawnTalbert> I expected pressing '?' or 'Ctrl+?' to bring up a list of app keyboard shortcuts
[2018-02-04 20:46:15] <MadLittleMods> ShawnTalbert: Pressing?(Shift +?key) brings up the shortcuts but you can't be focused in the chat input (press escape to blur the input). You can also access the menu via the markdown help icon in the bottom-right of the chat input -> Keyboard shortcuts
[2018-02-04 20:53:24] <PatrickMassot> Hi everyone. If I understand correctly, gitter uses highlight.js for syntax highlighting. Is this still true? If yes, does someone know which color theme is used? Is it one bundled with highlight.js or a specific gitter defined one? I'd like to PR a new language definition to highlight.js specifically aiming for use in gitter
[2018-02-04 21:22:10] <ShawnTalbert> MadLittleMods: thanks Eric. Wow, wish I could customize some of those - 4 keystroke shortcuts seem overkill!
[2018-02-04 23:53:07] <MadLittleMods> @PatrickMassot Yes, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/599aa0d3fd638d43eef0f9c0d8758481f592e1f3/package.json#L100See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/599aa0d3fd638d43eef0f9c0d8758481f592e1f3/public/less/highlight.less
[2018-02-05 08:04:16] <PatrickMassot> Thank you!
[2018-02-05 16:22:32] <GoddessMaat> Yes i wish someone could help me also
[2018-02-05 16:23:00] <GoddessMaat> Im working remotely to figure this out
[2018-02-05 16:23:43] <GoddessMaat> Hope im answering everyone
[2018-02-05 17:22:00] <InternetUnexplorer> Yes i wish someone could help me also@GoddessMaat You have not asked any questions. If you would like help, please describe the problem you are having.
[2018-02-05 17:49:59] <GoddessMaat> How do i contribute to proposals
[2018-02-05 17:54:36] <InternetUnexplorer> GoddessMaat: Proposals for...?
[2018-02-05 22:43:53] <ogwh> Just trying to use the IRC bridge at irc.gitter.im. It doesn't seem to be returning any channels when I /list (guessing that's a bad idea anyway, is there a convention?) and it keeps disconnecting me with a ping timeout of 78 seconds. Is it effectively down at the moment or is it a me error?
[2018-02-05 22:47:11] <ogwh> It seems to be autojoining me to this channel/room but the disconnects are ongoing. Thanks for any pointers. I'll avoid spamming the channel and leave this as the last message on the subject unless anyone responds.
[2018-02-05 23:40:31] <MadLittleMods> @ogwh We autojoin some rooms you already joined in the webapp if you haven't joined any after a couple secondsSee gitterHQ/irc-bridge#34 for ping pongs
[2018-02-07 19:02:35] <lautarodragan> Hi everybody! I've got a question about Gitter: can I edit the name of a community I've created?
[2018-02-07 19:56:11] <PatrickMassot> MadLittleMods: regarding my earlier "highlight.js in gitter" question: do you noticed that this lib is frozen? It currently has 94 open pull requests, including at least a dozen new language support listed on the [<-LINK->] and an [<-ISSUE->] open in order to find new maintainers.
[2018-02-07 19:57:10] <PatrickMassot> I wonder if you could have inside the gitter code base a place for highlight.js languages definitions
[2018-02-07 19:58:07] <PatrickMassot> so that people using gitter could PR your repo when they want a new language (at least until it appears upstream if resurrection happens)
[2018-02-07 20:13:57] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @lautarodraganThere isn't a way to change it after creation. You can send a message tosupport@gitter.imwith the details though
[2018-02-07 20:14:23] <lautarodragan> Gotcha. Thanks@MadLittleMods!
[2018-02-07 20:16:52] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @PatrickMassotWe have [<-LINK->] but it isn't up to date. From [<-ISSUE->] it looks like some it might get a new life soon. Then we would just need to look into any possible breaking changes between 8.x and 9.x
[2018-02-07 20:18:22] <PatrickMassot> Do you use this fork on this website?
[2018-02-07 20:40:18] <MadLittleMods> PatrickMassot: No (seepackage.jsonlink earlier). If you make a PR against the main repo, we can look into updating our fork and using that
[2018-02-07 20:40:56] <PatrickMassot> Ok, this is was my understanding
[2018-02-07 20:41:10] <PatrickMassot> I did make a PR againt the main repo
[2018-02-07 20:41:36] <PatrickMassot>  [<-ISSUE->] 
[2018-02-07 20:41:45] <PatrickMassot> gitter is even explicitly mentioned ;)
[2018-02-07 20:43:25] <MadLittleMods> @PatrickMassot Next step would be looking into the breaking changes from 8.x and 9.x and update the dependency (create a MR and please test), https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/tree/developThen we can update the fork with the latest 9.x changes along with your changes
[2018-02-07 20:44:43] <MadLittleMods> We also need to update the dependency here, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-02-07 20:50:14] <PatrickMassot> Testing gitter seems non-trivial, especially since the instructions are for MacOS only...
[2018-02-07 22:21:03] <MadLittleMods> PatrickMassot:  [<-LINK->] has macOS(similar for Linux) and Windows instructions
[2018-02-08 03:48:44] <wsdjeg> how to set the logo for my community? if it is not a github organization, the logo is empty in gitter Android APP!
[2018-02-08 05:50:32] <MadLittleMods> wsdjeg: On desktop, you can click the community avatar to upload a new one
[2018-02-08 07:46:41] <wsdjeg> after this is done， the logo will be update for Android APP？ I just  test in PC website. only room's avatar can be changed.
[2018-02-08 16:37:08] <MadLittleMods> wsdjeg: It should update. The avatar in the top-left of the chat header is the community avatar. There is not concept of a room avatar on Gitter
[2018-02-08 19:32:02] <TallTed_twitter> bug report I wanted to join this room because it seems the only way to request enhancement (not about this bug) of gitter.app ... but couldn't join room directly through gitter.app 1.177 because it doesn't show the "I understand" button on the "read before joining" alert, and the text there gives no hint that that button should be present!  Was able to join through browser; app then showed as joined; but still can't post through the app!(having quit and relaunched gitter.app, I can now post through the app.)
[2018-02-08 19:32:13] <TallTed_twitter> enhancement request gitter.app needs preference or other ability (cmd-+, cmd-–) to change font sizes and/or change font faces, similar to what most web browsers support.  I don't personally care much about the faces, but the default sizes are VERY SMALL on my screen.
[2018-02-08 19:32:17] <TallTed_twitter> enhancement request Relatedly, I would like to be able to change relative widths of the main 3 window panes.
[2018-02-08 19:33:12] <TallTed_twitter> 
[2018-02-08 19:35:19] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @TallTed_twitterWe suggest downloading the NW.js version of the app instead, [<-LINK->] (same root issue)
[2018-02-08 19:35:56] <MadLittleMods> You can track [<-LINK->] for font sizes
[2018-02-08 19:36:26] <MadLittleMods> No plans to make the sidebars resizable. They are collapsible though
[2018-02-08 20:21:21] <TallTed_twitter> Thanks,@MadLittleModsMight be time to update what folks get via https://gitter.im/apps -> https://update.gitter.im/osx/latest (and to properly sign the NW.js version)
#28 followed.
Collapsing sidebars doesn't help with room-names that exceed pane-width, nor make the Activity stream readably wide (4-6 words per line is too few).
[2018-02-08 20:23:04] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @TallTed_twitterWe don't point people to the NW.js version of the app because we want to improve our auto-update process first
[2018-02-09 16:23:29] <joey-galaxy> hi all, connecting to irc.gitter.im on hexchat, i am disconnected every minute or so due to ping timeout. i am not disconnected from other IRC servers on hexchat, which leads me to believe it isn't a problem on my end, but i'm not sure. how can i further investigate this problem? also possibly a bug report.
[2018-02-09 17:43:49] <kevinfiol> Gitter randomly breaks in latest Mozilla Firefox. Also, the search functionality is atrocious and the order of the results is seemingly random. But the worst part is, while you scroll and want to highlight the very next search result, the auto-expand/auto-shrink property of the results causes the WHOLE result list to shift, so you can't even view the results in ORDER.
[2018-02-09 17:44:01] <kevinfiol> It's mind-bogglingly bad
[2018-02-09 17:45:37] <kevinfiol> here's a gif of what i'm talking about:
[2018-02-09 17:46:15] <kevinfiol>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-02-09 17:46:21] <kevinfiol> i really dont know how such a thing went overlooked
[2018-02-09 17:53:57] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @joey-galaxySomeone else was experiencing this earlier,  [<-LINK->] . You can try running theirc-bridgefrom source and debugging the code there, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-02-09 17:56:50] <MadLittleMods>  February 9, 2018 11:43 AM @kevinfiol What do you mean by breaks (with Firefox)?Feel free to create an issue to about ways to improve the UX with search. Here is an issue about sorting, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/566
[2018-02-09 18:23:48] <joey-galaxy>  [<-CODE->] 
[2018-02-09 18:24:04] <joey-galaxy> By the way, how did you respond with that emoji and timestamp? Did you write it all out?
[2018-02-09 18:24:16] <joey-galaxy> Also looks like I accidentally wrote in your quote
[2018-02-09 18:30:47] <PatrickMassot> Alt-click (or shift-alt-click) on the time of message
[2018-02-09 18:36:21] <InternetUnexplorer> i really don't know how such a thing went overlooked@kevinfiol I doubt it will be fixed any time soon. For reference, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/1554 (not quite the same issue, but very similar) has been open for over a year now, and the PR to fix it has been open for 5 months.
[2018-02-09 18:52:53] <kevinfiol> MadLittleMods: on FF, sometimes the styles just don't load and the UI becomes this cluttered mess where all images are rendered at full size. I had thought it was uBlock, but even after disabling that, it happens. It's RANDOMLY fixed itself again, so it's not happening now (with uBlock on). I'll try to give more specifics next time it happens.
[2018-02-09 18:55:23] <kevinfiol> InternetUnexplorer: that's saddening to hear. what's kinda silly is that a simple 'fix' would be just to remove the auto-expand/auto-minimize on mouseover. it would make the search actually usable. you don't NEED to be able to view the entire comment in what should just be a preview, I could just click and go to the full comment.
[2018-02-09 19:29:45] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @kevinfiolWe haven't had other reports of styles not loading. When it happens, open the devtools and try to find those requests in the network panel to see what happened.
[2018-02-09 19:35:59] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @InternetUnexplorer@kevinfiolWe are [<-LINK->] . Things have mostly sat because we have other GitLab responsibilities and don't have much Gitter bandwidth these days.
[2018-02-09 19:49:59] <joey-galaxy> PatrickMassot: Alt-click on the timestamp does not work on Firefox on Ubuntu 17.10 -- brings up the taskbar menu instead
[2018-02-09 19:50:21] <PatrickMassot> did you try shift-alt click?
[2018-02-09 19:50:37] <joey-galaxy> Why not add to the...dropdown? that way I can use left-click and not a funky key combo
[2018-02-09 19:51:00] <joey-galaxy>  [<-LINK->] after a few tries shift+alt+click worked :) I might have messed it up
[2018-02-09 19:51:35] <PatrickMassot> I agree it would be more natural to have it in the dropdown
[2018-02-09 20:04:09] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @joey-galaxy@PatrickMassotHere is a proposal I wrote a while back, [<-LINK->] - Feel free to create  MR
[2018-02-09 20:10:24] <joey-galaxy> maybe if there's a BTC bounty for that feature ;)
[2018-02-11 05:37:15] <Sahil5963> hey
[2018-02-11 05:38:37] <Sahil5963> there should be a close button to close the side menu
[2018-02-11 20:25:29] <vinny1962> I do not know why somone from GitHub would send me here can anyone tell me.
[2018-02-11 20:25:47] <vinny1962> I was looking for some software help and she sent me here.
[2018-02-11 21:49:26] <ocramz> Hi! Can you please mention the DataHaskell channel ( [<-LINK->] ) on [<-LINK->] ? thanks!
[2018-02-12 00:49:36] <berieo> its a chatroom for github,u can ask some queastions here
[2018-02-12 03:31:13] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @vinny1962@ocramzThis room is only for Gitter support, not general technical support. Perhaps the person on GitHub was more pointing you to the Gitter room specific to the project you were referred from. Use the search under the magnifying glass on the very left to find the room.
[2018-02-12 03:32:16] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @Sahil5963There are collapse buttons on both the left menu and right sidebar. If you want to completely remove it, you could add some custom CSS via browser extension or just open up the devtools and delete it quickly when you first visit
[2018-02-12 03:43:34] <MadLittleMods>  February 11, 2018 3:49 PM @ocramz What's a good description we can use? [<-CODE->] 
[2018-02-12 18:50:59] <haneefmubarak> So I was trying to add a private org, but apparently I hadn't authenticated for that org yet. I couldn't find a way to do that, so I revoked the GitHub OAuth for Public and Private repos for Gitter. Then I tried to log back in and it did in fact redirect to reacquire the Public token from GitHub, but I can't seem to get Private Repo access.
[2018-02-12 18:52:29] <haneefmubarak> I tried clicking "Allow Private Repo Access", but it doesn't do anything. When I open the link in a new tab, it just presents the same room (but with a messed up layout).
[2018-02-12 19:13:50] <MadLittleMods> @haneefmubarak See https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/topics/topic/57f3830543b5aeb00996b942/why-isnt-my-github-organisation-appearing for how to manually grant access to the org without having to get prompted again."Allow Private Repo Access" may be getting caught by your pop-up blocker. When you click it, you can temporily move past in the address bar with Chrome for example.
[2018-02-12 19:32:11] <haneefmubarak> MadLittleMods: it turned out to be some weird interaction with a cookie
[2018-02-12 19:32:24] <haneefmubarak> It worked after clearing cookies for gitter.im
[2018-02-12 19:35:29] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @haneefmubarakI don't know of a cookie around this. Perhaps the refresh got things going again
[2018-02-12 19:37:36] <haneefmubarak> Eh. I tried refreshing and clearing cache and the usuals
[2018-02-12 20:52:54] <TallTed_twitter> issueSeen with both the v3 and v1 Gitter.app on macOS. Just because a message has been displayed onscreen while the app was active, does NOT make it read -- especially since the app auto-scrolls to the latest message, leaving umpteen unread in the invisible backscroll. I now have 150+ unread messages in one channel that I need to catch up on. The "go up there" thing decided that it didn't need to go to the last message I actuallyhadread, so I had to scroll up manually ~50 messages.  There should be a way for me to set "unread from here forward", and likewise, to set "all read"
[2018-02-12 21:05:02] <MadLittleMods> TallTed_twitter: You can track [<-LINK->] and [<-LINK->] 
[2018-02-12 21:09:39] <TallTed_twitter> MadLittleMods: Gah. Last touched 9 and 12 months ago. Not encouraging.
[2018-02-13 15:06:41] <pombredanne> Hi :)
[2018-02-13 15:06:45] <pombredanne> I am trying to create a room for [<-LINK->] and I get a 404?
[2018-02-13 15:06:59] <pombredanne> actually a "community"
[2018-02-13 15:07:14] <pombredanne> I am not the org admin at GH, but a contributor and the org admin tried without luck
[2018-02-13 15:14:05] <pombredanne> and I could not do it either
[2018-02-13 17:30:57] <MadLittleMods> pombredanne: See [<-LINK->] 
[2018-02-13 17:31:35] <MadLittleMods> Can you expand on what is not working? What are you expecting?
[2018-02-13 18:43:24] <JBallin> hey guys the author of Eloquent Javascript was considering opening a gitter room but had trouble. you can respond here, if interested [<-ISSUE->] 
[2018-02-13 18:46:35] <pombredanne> MadLittleMods: thanks for the reply. Very simply I cannot create a community calledclearlydefined
[2018-02-13 18:47:08] <pombredanne> Sounds like the name has been squatted? but at the same time there is no such existing one in Gitter
[2018-02-13 18:48:31] <MadLittleMods> pombredanne: To create theclearlydefinedcommunity on Gitter, it needs to be associated with the GitHub org. Click the "github projects" link and select it. If you don't see it listed, follow the steps in the article I linked earlier
[2018-02-13 18:55:38] <pombredanne> MadLittleMods: ok, fair enough. But even if I use the plain gitter only creation, it rejects the name as being taken?
[2018-02-13 18:56:38] <MadLittleMods> pombredanne: We reserve the same names that are on GitHub. In order to create something with the same name as a GitHub entity, it needs to be associated
[2018-02-13 18:59:37] <pombredanne> MadLittleMods: This makes sense then :P
[2018-02-13 19:00:00] <pombredanne> thx, let me figure out this oauth policy. That sounds scarry :P
[2018-02-13 20:23:05] <octogonz> I'm using the Gitter desktop app for Windows.  It plays an annoying sound literallyevery timesomeone sends a message.  How do I configure or disable this sound effect?
[2018-02-13 20:23:11] <octogonz> To be clear, I don't want to disable notifications, just the sounds.
[2018-02-13 20:29:32] <MadLittleMods> pgonzal: It's in context menu
[2018-02-13 20:30:00] <octogonz> awesome, thanks!
[2018-02-14 01:36:07] <charafau> Hello! Is Android client source code available somewhere ? I would like to add dark theme to it
[2018-02-14 02:09:39] <MadLittleMods> charafau: The Android app isn't open source yet
[2018-02-14 02:12:14] <charafau> MadLittleMods: thanks, would it be possible to ask devs to change theme to day night ?
[2018-02-14 02:12:32] <charafau> At night is almost unbearable
[2018-02-14 03:34:42] <MadLittleMods> charafau: It's unlikely that any movement will happen there because we have very limited bandwidth atm and are focusing on the webapp. You could use the webapp with the dark theme on.
[2018-02-14 07:22:10] <ogwh> Wrong channel apparently. I think. I don't understand this UI.
[2018-02-14 07:23:38] <ogwh> Looks like I've found a bug in Gitter. When I clicked on the TypeScript channel the URL updated and TypeScript was highlighted but I was still here. Hence the confusion. My brain ignored the header, associating it with the platform and not the channel.
[2018-02-14 07:23:50] <ogwh> After trying again it worked...
[2018-02-14 13:06:05] <hbons> Hi, I'm trying to create a room for my project github.com/hbons/SparkleShare, but I get a warning icon when I type in "SparkleShare" as the room name. Thinking maybe someone else made this room I went to [<-LINK->] but nothing exists there. Help appreciated!
[2018-02-14 17:10:38] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @ogwhCould be one of thesehttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/1191

[2018-02-14 17:11:39] <MadLittleMods>  February 14, 2018 7:06 AM @hbons https://github.com/SparkleShare already exists on GitHub so you would need to sign in as that user to create that community. [<-CODE->] 
[2018-02-14 19:24:42] <hbons> MadLittleMods: that did it, thanks.
[2018-02-14 23:54:23] <ogwh> Thanks Eric it looks like 1191. Sorry I can’t see your username on the iOS app so can’t address you properly.

[2018-02-15 08:19:21] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> Hey everyone. Is there a recent ressource stating the current situation of Gitter and its' development? I read it's been aquired by GitLab, which will probably not help with integration functionality with GitHub. I used it for a while 2 years ago but then moved away because projects didn't require it much anymore. I think it is definately better than Slack for anything public but before I try to motivate my research team to use Gitter, I want to be sure it's "hot".The reasons why I bring this up are:buggy creation of room in community where I am no admin throws error in typescript dev tools but no UI info is shown
issue in gitlab open for 6 months


uploading images failed twice in desktop version and only partially uploaded images (bottom half of jpg missing) on webapp with firefox
app reviews for iOS app are terrible
app reviews for android are mediocre
keyboard shortcuts shortcut not working on LinuxI want to find out if I, by coincidence maybe, stumbled upon some rare bugs but generally everyone is happy with this or if it is a dying platform. Slack sucks in my eyes because it's closed and limits the amount of messages. Gitter seemed the perfect companion for GitHub/Lab but I formed some doubts when I opened up the client again after a while now. Some opinions would be appreciated. I also saw a gitter/webapp-temp-issues-for-move repo where a lot of issues seem to be stuck in. what's that about?
[2018-02-15 12:24:01] <bvhme> I would also want to know if Gitter is no longer developed/maintained, the lastest update on the GitLab repo seems to be 5 months ago: [<-LINK->] 
[2018-02-15 12:38:53] <pombredanne> bvhme: you are likely looking at the wrong branch: [<-LINK->] and see also: [<-LINK->] 
[2018-02-15 12:39:17] <bvhme> Ah, so the Develop branch is the branch that is deployed?
[2018-02-15 12:39:38] <bvhme> (If so, why is there a master )
[2018-02-15 12:39:42] <pombredanne> no idea
[2018-02-15 12:39:55] <pombredanne> but you raise a good point
[2018-02-15 12:41:44] <bvhme> Deployed on web is 708c5f
[2018-02-15 12:43:37] <pombredanne> which from which branch?
[2018-02-15 12:43:42] <bvhme> No idea
[2018-02-15 12:43:58] <bvhme> Can’t figure out how to go to a SHA in the GitLab interface
[2018-02-15 12:44:12] <pombredanne> same
[2018-02-15 12:44:21] <bvhme> But that is what I do if I do [<-CODE->] in the browser
[2018-02-15 12:44:32] <pombredanne> anyway , I am battling FLOSS project to not use slack for projects and Gitter instead.@MadLittleModscan you clarify a bit this?
[2018-02-15 12:44:44] <bvhme> Me too, same situation
[2018-02-15 12:45:09] <bvhme> I'm guessing that version is a SHA
[2018-02-15 12:45:43] <pombredanne> and@pascalwhoopexpressed a similar point wrt. slack above FWIW
[2018-02-15 12:46:10] <bvhme> I do hate that Slack is not open
[2018-02-15 12:46:49] <bvhme> Also, we have a Discourse and I would kind of like the actual important conversations to be on there and not have those things happen on the Slack
[2018-02-15 12:47:13] <pombredanne> well I do not hate them for that. I think this is a great business app and very poor choice for FLOSS projects. Beside the fact that slack is not open, viewing chats requires signin which is a terrible thing to require for an open project
[2018-02-15 12:47:15] <bvhme> There is only one issue that has the exact SHA from that version in it and it is 4 months old… [<-LINK->] 
[2018-02-15 12:47:29] <bvhme> pombredanne: I concur
[2018-02-15 12:48:15] <pombredanne> ok,@bvhmeit looks that you raised a very valid point.
[2018-02-15 12:49:23] <bvhme> pombredanne: are you considering any other tools?
[2018-02-15 12:52:52] <pombredanne> bvhme: not at the moment. I would like to hear from maintainers first :P
[2018-02-15 12:53:11] <pombredanne> e.g. you raised a valid point but I trust folks by default
[2018-02-15 12:53:38] <bvhme> Me too, however I’m just trying to find what is out there
[2018-02-15 14:12:05] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> Yes slack for foss is aweful. The question is what is Gitter supposed to serve? Code related discussion is best occurring in issues and prs. Serious questions why things don’t work or how they work are great to be indexed and sorted on stackoverflow
[2018-02-15 14:12:36] <bvhme> Yeah, however developers love to chat
[2018-02-15 14:12:51] <bvhme> Banter and chatter are important in communities as well
[2018-02-15 14:12:52] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> So mostly easy direkt support I guess and some form of community feeling.
[2018-02-15 14:12:58] <bvhme> Yup
[2018-02-15 14:13:28] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> Me and two other guys earlier found an awful bug in Gitter that allows us to inject any css or html and even I Frames with JavaScript into the chat
[2018-02-15 14:13:48] <bvhme> And, has it been fixed?
[2018-02-15 14:14:15] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> I’ll create an issue with that and use it as a ‘sensor’ on how alive Gitter is. We just found it this morning
[2018-02-15 14:15:03] <bvhme> Do you have a link to the issue for me?
[2018-02-15 14:15:42] <bvhme> Then I can sensor as well :)
[2018-02-15 14:22:00] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> I’ll post it when it’s up. Someone else is posting it, he found it and should get credit
[2018-02-15 14:22:14] <bvhme> Great, thanks!
[2018-02-15 14:22:26] <pombredanne> bvhme: @pascalwhoopwe think alike :P
[2018-02-15 14:25:43] <pombredanne> which projects are you involved with, if I may ask?
[2018-02-15 14:26:55] <bvhme> I’m involved in an EU project to get cities to develop software together
[2018-02-15 14:28:05] <pombredanne> actually the nick link to GH users ;)
[2018-02-15 14:28:09] <pombredanne> bvhme: very nice!
[2018-02-15 14:28:37] <pombredanne> And I just commented on this [<-LINK->] :P)
[2018-02-15 14:29:42] <bvhme> Actually, could you comment that at: [<-LINK->] :p
[2018-02-15 14:30:06] <bvhme> I’m actually just now trying to get that to become bigger
[2018-02-15 14:30:21] <bvhme> So we can get more governments to collaborate on their software
[2018-02-15 14:31:43] <pombredanne> bvhme: done :P
[2018-02-15 14:32:04] <bvhme> Awesome, thanks!
[2018-02-15 14:32:58] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> Please ask Naples, Italy to join that. I figured out how to hack all their trains security cameras last week. It's all based on WEP wifi encryption and XP based displays  some good software and QC would desperately be needde
[2018-02-15 14:33:29] <pombredanne> tstt :P
[2018-02-15 14:33:50] <bvhme> Yeah, actually the Team Digitale people in that repo want to make national policy out of adopting this as a standard
[2018-02-15 14:34:00] <bvhme> Those are the other collaborators
[2018-02-15 14:34:46] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> 
[2018-02-15 14:35:36] <bvhme> Ow snap
[2018-02-15 14:42:40] <cbj4074> I've used Gitter consistently for the last three years and I've seen as little forward progress as I've seen from Slack. Neither platform has done anything useful in years.
[2018-02-15 14:43:08] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> bvhme: @pombredannehas been filled with KaTeX as that is the attack vector. But I believe it's not the library that's to blame but rather Gitter not sanitizing server-side before redistributing to clients [<-ISSUE->] 
[2018-02-15 14:43:10] <bvhme> I actually think Slack has become impressively stable

[2018-02-15 14:44:12] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> brutally stable. and brutally inappropriate for not-20ppl offices
[2018-02-15 14:44:19] <cbj4074> One would hope so, with a $5-9bn valuation and $250m in funding
[2018-02-15 14:44:20] <bvhme> True
[2018-02-15 14:44:42] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> I actually worked in a startup with 10 ppl, perfect for an all-slack team. We had slack premium but everyone defaulted back to emails. 10 developers that is. No idea why
[2018-02-15 14:44:53] <cbj4074> I still can't use Slack (or Gitter, for that matter) on a 4K monitor with display scaling at 175%.
[2018-02-15 14:45:04] <cbj4074> (scrolling gets all jacked-up)
[2018-02-15 14:45:08] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> cbj4074: why not?
[2018-02-15 14:45:13] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> works fine for me. What OS are you using and what client?
[2018-02-15 14:45:22] <cbj4074> Are you using display scaling?
[2018-02-15 14:45:23] <cbj4074> The chat doesn't scroll on its own.
[2018-02-15 14:45:30] <cbj4074> Every time someone types I have to scroll down manually.
[2018-02-15 14:45:59] <cbj4074> OS is Windows 10, and desktop client
[2018-02-15 14:46:01] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> I'm on Ubuntu w/ Firefox and 4k 60hz 27", no scrolling issues
[2018-02-15 14:46:41] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> okay. can't help then 
[2018-02-15 14:46:41] <cbj4074> I believe it to be a product of display scaling, specifically. Not sure what Ubuntu calls that feature, but surely it exists there, too.
[2018-02-15 14:46:58] <cbj4074> And it's only with certain scales. 150% works fine. 175% does not.
[2018-02-15 14:47:03] <cbj4074> Somebody's math is bad.
[2018-02-15 14:47:23] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> well as I use it as a web-tech based app. It's simply a matter of pressingctrl +until I have a scaling I like
[2018-02-15 14:47:47] <cbj4074> Yeah, I should test it in the browser, too. A fairly minor annoyance, I suppose.
[2018-02-15 14:48:02] <cbj4074> (I just live with it at 150% instead of where I really want it, which is 175%)
[2018-02-15 14:48:05] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> would bug the hell out of me too though. move hand to mouse for every new message. meh
[2018-02-15 14:48:13] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> or page-down works too I guess
[2018-02-15 14:48:28] <cbj4074> Yep, exactly, it bugs the hell out of me, so I threw in the towel and adjusted the UI to 150%.
[2018-02-15 14:49:02] <cbj4074> But to answer your question (I don't work for Gitter or GitLab), I do not see forward progress here. I could be wrong. But since the acquisition, everything has been put on hold.
[2018-02-15 14:49:28] <cbj4074> We keep hearing, "We just need to sort the high-priority issues related to the transition first, then we'll get back to development"
[2018-02-15 14:49:36] <cbj4074> I'll believe it when I see it
[2018-02-15 14:49:53] <cbj4074> IMO, Discord has blown by both of these platforms.
[2018-02-15 14:49:57] <bvhme> That is sad, so Gitter might be abandonware?
[2018-02-15 14:50:19] <cbj4074> It looks that way to me, but I'm just a "regular user", with no insight into the company's plans
[2018-02-15 14:50:38] <cbj4074> But there are still so many high-priority issues that have remained untouched for months or even years in some cases.
[2018-02-15 14:51:10] <cbj4074> Like even the most basic forms of moderation
[2018-02-15 14:51:58] <cbj4074> GitLab's lack of straightforwardness with regard to future plans for Gitter says it all, IMO.
[2018-02-15 14:53:01] <pombredanne> sigh:|
[2018-02-15 14:55:16] <pombredanne> sometimes I regret Google wave :D

[2018-02-15 14:55:30] <cbj4074> $2.2M + $20M in funding
[2018-02-15 14:55:35] <cbj4074> A team of six people...
[2018-02-15 14:56:01] <cbj4074> And no updates as to future plans since early 2017
[2018-02-15 14:56:07] <cbj4074> (when it was acquired)
[2018-02-15 14:56:14] <pombredanne> cbj4074: wrong article?
[2018-02-15 14:56:23] <cbj4074> Yep, sorry
[2018-02-15 14:56:28] <pombredanne> :D
[2018-02-15 14:56:51] <cbj4074> Thanks, sorry, haha. No idea how that happened.
[2018-02-15 14:57:19] <cbj4074> Oh, I see now. If you scroll down the page, to the next article, the URL changes. Not sure how I feel about that...
[2018-02-15 14:57:28] <pombredanne> bad :P
[2018-02-15 14:57:55] <pombredanne> terrible thing!
[2018-02-15 14:57:59] <cbj4074> So here we are, a year on since the acquisition, tens of millions of dollars dumped into it, and no apparent changes of any sort.
[2018-02-15 14:58:20] <cbj4074> I hope I'm proven wrong, and something amazing comes about...
[2018-02-15 14:58:23] <pombredanne> MadLittleMods: is responsive to questions here
[2018-02-15 14:58:37] <pombredanne> at least
[2018-02-15 14:59:06] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-02-15 15:00:10] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> Let's see what's happening with this ticket. I'm really tempted to inject some Rick Rolled audio into this channel to get the teams' attention quickly but I will refrain xD
[2018-02-15 15:00:24] <pombredanne> pascalwhoop: please do not :P
[2018-02-15 15:00:38] <pombredanne> I meant, please refrain
[2018-02-15 15:01:02] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> No fan of Rick Astley?
[2018-02-15 15:01:06] <cbj4074> pascalwhoop:  I, too, am curious to see how it's handled.
[2018-02-15 15:02:45] <cbj4074> loves Rick Astley
[2018-02-15 15:22:23] <pombredanne> not the kind of thing you want to do in a channel with 6K folks, IMHO
[2018-02-15 15:33:18] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> well we just established everyone is dormant and barely anyone is active soooo. No i'm cool about it, but you can understand the temptation. Imagine 6k developers accumulated shame when you play something less socially acceptable on their machines in the offices. just because they have gitter open. I sure hope they react fast to the issue
[2018-02-15 15:33:54] <bvhme> :’(
[2018-02-15 15:33:55] <ArStah> pascalwhoop: 
[2018-02-15 15:34:13] <bvhme> PLEASE DONT RICKROLL ME
[2018-02-15 15:34:45] <bvhme> So are we going to fork and build a new startup out of this? ;)
[2018-02-15 15:35:18] <ArStah> bvhme: why not?
[2018-02-15 15:36:54] <bvhme>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-02-15 15:37:15] <ArStah>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-02-15 15:37:31] <ArStah> But we need to add this as feature
[2018-02-15 15:37:39] <bvhme> Do you know: [<-LINK->] 
[2018-02-15 15:37:43] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> haha the "fuck off, I'm going home" button?
[2018-02-15 15:38:01] <bvhme> Interesting concept
[2018-02-15 15:38:07] <bvhme> :D
[2018-02-15 15:38:33] <ArStah> pascalwhoop: yep
[2018-02-15 15:38:39] <ArStah> :D
[2018-02-15 15:48:17] <ArStah> I'm listening music from that chat for about 3 hours :)
[2018-02-15 15:48:51] <bvhme> Ow snap
[2018-02-15 15:56:01] <cbj4074> ArStah: Rick Astley on repeat?
[2018-02-15 15:56:30] <ArStah> No [<-LINK->] 
[2018-02-15 15:56:38] <ArStah> Wow, embeding
[2018-02-15 15:58:00] <bvhme> Have you inserted bitcoin miners into our clients yet?
[2018-02-15 15:58:19] <ArStah> bvhme: you'll never know
[2018-02-15 16:01:17] <ArStah> bvhme: why did you write it??? My kind and bad angels on my shoulders began to argue
[2018-02-15 16:01:38] <bvhme> ArStah: write what?
[2018-02-15 16:01:47] <ArStah> Have you inserted bitcoin miners into our clients yet?
[2018-02-15 16:02:04] <bvhme> Everyone in this chat
[2018-02-15 16:02:18] <bvhme> Enjoying a day of low security gittering
[2018-02-15 16:02:55] <cbj4074> ArStah: LOL, that goes back to my point about critical issues not being fixed for years. The fact that you can't disable displaying embeds like that by default is absurd, IMO.
[2018-02-15 16:03:25] <ArStah> cbj4074: i can... this is the issue))
[2018-02-15 16:03:38] <cbj4074> Hehehe, true!
[2018-02-15 16:03:44] <bvhme> Yeah I know, that is what we’re worrying about ;)
[2018-02-15 16:07:57] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> Now I gotta say I am in a bit of a pickle. What about a simple "ping" script to inject that pings a server. See how many clients execute it. Wouldn't do anything but do a PUT on some server. Just to see how many are exposed.
[2018-02-15 16:08:18] <bvhme> Very interesting
[2018-02-15 16:08:22] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> holy shit team, please fix quickly or I am getting the fuck out of here
[2018-02-15 16:08:26] <ArStah> pascalwhoop: i just trying to do it)
[2018-02-15 16:08:46] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> meanwhile engineering ping script
[2018-02-15 16:09:07] <bvhme> HackerOne page of GitLab says ‘Average time to resolution: 3 months"
[2018-02-15 16:09:17] <ArStah> Woioioi
[2018-02-15 16:09:29] <bvhme> Time to first response: 6 hours
[2018-02-15 16:10:44] <cbj4074> Yep, I won't stick around either, if this isn't fixed very quickly.
[2018-02-15 16:13:11] <bvhme> I’m going to tweet at them
[2018-02-15 16:15:19] <ArStah> 
[2018-02-15 16:16:26] <pombredanne> bvhme: hey give the dev a chance to react first
[2018-02-15 16:16:31] <pombredanne> be nice, be cool
[2018-02-15 16:16:54] <bvhme> okay okay okay
[2018-02-15 16:16:59] <pombredanne> and may be submit a patch :P
[2018-02-15 16:17:07] <bvhme> but then don’t inject any miners into my stream okay
[2018-02-15 16:17:11] <bvhme> promise?
[2018-02-15 16:17:21] <pombredanne> I would never do such thing
[2018-02-15 16:23:14] <cbj4074> Well, that's another issue; the fact that nobody on staff is monitoring this channel with relative frequency is a problem.
[2018-02-15 16:23:44] <bvhme> Or their issues on the repo
[2018-02-15 16:28:58] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> Okay I think we can all agree that miners and anything bad is not cool
[2018-02-15 16:29:31] <ArStah> Yep
[2018-02-15 16:29:53] <bvhme> And that we’re all resposible adults
[2018-02-15 16:30:04] <bvhme> That never do not-cool things
[2018-02-15 16:32:04] <bvhme> Although the video on this issue is pretty cool
[2018-02-15 16:32:17] <bvhme> GitterSpinner
[2018-02-15 16:34:14] <TallTed_twitter>  [<-LINK->] @MadLittleMods- That's not a context[ual] menu, that's the main app menu. Contextual menu is what comes when you right-click. Worth noting -- these sorts of settings don't generally belong in the main app menu, especially but not only on macOS where they break with the [<-LINK->] . Theymayreasonably be accessed through a dialog which is opened via a Preferences item in that main menu.
[2018-02-15 16:48:52] <cbj4074> This reminds me ^, that's another problem with Gitter: the inability to see a link's destination (in the Desktop client, anyway).
[2018-02-15 16:49:28] <bvhme> Yup, that also seems like a fishy  phising situation
[2018-02-15 16:49:35] <cbj4074> (I could use DevTools, but that's not a practical requirement for the average end-user)
[2018-02-15 16:56:16] <bvhme> Sk
[2018-02-15 16:57:08] <bvhme> pascalwhoop: Maybe make a HackerOne report for GitLab? Or is that a different crew...
[2018-02-15 16:59:22] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> I guess why not.@ArStahwould you like to do that or shall I? You already made one with Khan right?
[2018-02-15 17:00:40] <ArStah> No, i didn't make report to gitter there, didn't find it
[2018-02-15 17:04:50] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> ArStah: they are part of GitLab now. That's probably what started the whole dormant dev situation
[2018-02-15 17:05:15] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> I mean we are basically discussing in their living room about how fucked their app is right now and no one cares
[2018-02-15 17:06:29] <ArStah> Okay, if you want - create an issue on hackerone
[2018-02-15 17:06:43] <ArStah> If not - i'll do it little bit later
[2018-02-15 17:28:07] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> bvhme: It's actually a "GlitterDisco" as we replaced "Gitter" up top with a pink "Glitter", playing disco and we have spinning colorful balls dancing around the screen. but then Arsen went all crazy with the dizzying spinning of the whole client. I guess he was trying to make a point
[2018-02-15 17:28:36] <ArStah> pascalwhoop: not glitter, there is "Disco" label
[2018-02-15 17:28:44] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> Damn there goes a whole afternoon down the drain :-D

[2018-02-15 17:53:32] <TallTed_twitter> oh, even more excitingissue-- I'm here, and in 4 other rooms, but none of them show me as one of the People! In case it matters, I'm using Gitter 3.x on macOS.
[2018-02-15 18:13:04] <TallTed_twitter> Client doesn't seem to matter, as there's no change with webapp nor with Gitter 1.x on macOS.  (6 MB 1.x built June 2016, 113 MB 3.x built Aug 2016...  unreal.)
[2018-02-15 18:20:33] <cbj4074> Was the issue made private ( [<-LINK->] )?
[2018-02-15 18:20:43] <ArStah> Yes
[2018-02-15 18:20:49] <cbj4074> Okay, fair enough. At least they are aware of it.
[2018-02-15 18:31:46] <MadLittleMods> Heya, sorry for the slow response. I’m working on a proper response but we want to make sure everything is correct before commenting.I made the issue confidential, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/1859
[2018-02-15 18:44:56] <ArStah> Good
[2018-02-15 18:51:03] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> Gitter is alive
[2018-02-15 19:55:12] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] We have some future roadmap plans for Gitter here, https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/gitter/-/epicsCommunity moderation has been long overdue. I have a couple PRs on the old GitHub repo that need to be ported over to the GitLab repo that add soft-deletion and reporting/flagging of users (previous closed source project, will 404). But we need to get deployments going again first.We are currently working on a security fix for the problem @pascalwhoop/@ArStah reported (currently confidential, will 404) and will get an emergency deployment out through the old GitHub repo.
[2018-02-15 19:58:43] <ArStah> MadLittleMods: happy to see pretty fast reaction
[2018-02-15 20:17:56] <rokf> 
[2018-02-15 20:21:32] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> MadLittleMods: Yes, great reaction  sorry for the kiddo like discussion here. In retrospect it feels a bit immature. I guess we were excited about our first XSS  is there a place where helping hands can grab something heavy to carry in the future? I might have some motivation to help the next months as my main focus will be working with a team that will switch to gitter.
[2018-02-15 20:49:03] <MadLittleMods> pascalwhoop: Anything with thereadylabel is something needs to be addressed, [<-LINK->] but feel free to tackle something of personal interest (discuss in an issue then create a MR)
[2018-02-15 20:49:24] <cbj4074> MadLittleMods: To echo the other sentiments, thank you for the reassuring commentary. That makes me (and my colleagues) feel much better about the status quo. Thanks also for jumping on that vulnerability quickly. Gitter is unique in the FLOSS aspect, which is what attracts many of us to the product and project. Great to hear that things are moving forward, albeit slowly at the moment. Thanks again.

[2018-02-15 22:54:19] <adelbertc> but would a name of the person who filed the ticket help?
[2018-02-15 22:57:01] <pombredanne> MadLittleMods: thank you 
[2018-02-15 23:13:51] <bvhme> So@pombredannewhat is your project?
[2018-02-15 23:15:16] <bvhme> And also you@pascalwhoop? I'm pretty interested now
[2018-02-15 23:24:02] <pombredanne> bvhme:  [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] and [<-LINK->] and a few other :P
[2018-02-15 23:24:37] <pombredanne> most have to do with finding code origin, licensing and eventually vulnerabilities ;)
[2018-02-16 03:03:08] <MadLittleMods> thevipulaggarwal: @somosSwan_twitterThis room is for Gitter support, not general technical help. Please use [<-LINK->] 
[2018-02-16 03:20:01] <MadLittleMods> Heads-up (Gitter dev here), there was an XSS exploit in Gitter that allowed someone to embed a crypto mining script via chat message (this room was targeted). The exploit has been fixed and the messages removed but you could still be affected. You can check whether you are still affected by following the instructions in the blog post, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-02-16 04:29:28] <ycyash_twitter> I created a new room. Added some people. Then left the room accidently. Now i have rejoined the room but have lost the admin options. Is this something that can be rectified?
[2018-02-16 04:29:56] <MadLittleMods> ycyash_twitter: Link the room please
[2018-02-16 04:30:51] <ycyash_twitter> MadLittleMods:  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-02-16 04:33:00] <MadLittleMods> ycyash_twitter: I see that you are the admin of the community, [<-LINK->] but there are 3 other admins in the [<-LINK->] room that can add you back
[2018-02-16 04:38:02] <ycyash_twitter> MadLittleMods: So under room settings, I no longer see options in the drop down like "Integrations, Tags, Settings". I only see "Add People, Share, Notifications, Archives, Leave this room"? On my other rooms, I see a lot of other options.
[2018-02-16 04:56:39] <MadLittleMods> ycyash_twitter: One of the other 3 admins has the "Permissions" option and can add you back
[2018-02-16 04:57:18] <ycyash_twitter> MadLittleMods: Thanks!
[2018-02-16 06:35:14] <bvhme> In the end I am a bit sad that someone mined this channel even though we said we wouldn't...
[2018-02-16 06:35:52] <bvhme> Thanks again@MadLittleModsfor fixing it!
[2018-02-16 06:39:52] <ArStah> Hi everyone...Yep, big thanks to gitter developers for fixing it@bvhmeprobably it is my fault, because i sent the message to see, how much clients will launch it. I deleted it after 2 minutes, but, seems, that someone found the code... Sorry about that
[2018-02-16 06:49:01] <bvhme> ArStah: No bad blood, I was actually a bit tounge in cheek about this, we knew it was going to happen and stayed around 
[2018-02-16 06:49:27] <bvhme> Maybe because we are digital thrill seekers
[2018-02-16 06:49:58] <bvhme> Really did love the work you did@ArStahand am quite impressed
[2018-02-16 06:50:28] <ArStah> Swear i found this bug almost by accident)
[2018-02-16 06:52:50] <bvhme> that doesn't make it any less impressive 
[2018-02-16 06:53:36] <ArStah> It started just from doing empty message\huge {~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~}
[2018-02-16 09:09:35] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> Honestly. Some douche that was... It's silly to think you can make and kind of money with this crap. It's a few dozen PC's for a day. Meh.. but I see it this way: idiots are so focused on crypto mining, they toss a miner in a vulnerability and call it a day. Now good old hackers went all the way, exploiting the shit out of stuff and that was always quiet information gathering. Which is much more dangerous I think. So good thing it was just some dick trying to earn his next coffee.
[2018-02-16 09:27:03] <ArStah> Hope he'll even don't earn coffe
[2018-02-16 09:34:05] <anddam> how do I join a channel from the IRC gateway?
[2018-02-16 09:35:22] <anddam> the usual IRC syntax  #user/project  doesn't work, even tho' the one channel I see via the IRC client has that same form
[2018-02-16 09:38:49] <anddam> mm odd enough I could join this channel from the irc client (where I'm typing this very line), but I cannot do the same with scopatz/xonsh
[2018-02-16 09:39:35] <anddam> ohhh wait, the github project got renamed, but the title via web interface stayed scopatz/xonsh
[2018-02-16 09:39:41] <anddam> my bad, sorry for the noise
[2018-02-16 18:15:06] <MadLittleMods> infinite-turtles: You can use [<-LINK->] instead of this channel for testing. You could also setup your own private test room.
[2018-02-16 18:15:14] <infinite-turtles> Is the IRC bridge working? I can send but not receive?
[2018-02-16 18:15:26] <MadLittleMods> infinite-turtles: You won't receive your own messages
[2018-02-16 18:15:45] <infinite-turtles> yep, that was my problem. Didn't realize that
[2018-02-17 02:23:26] <EreckGordon> i don't like bridges that make it impossible to ping the user.matrixbotis one. very difficult to tell who you are talking to.
[2018-02-21 12:58:20] <Cynede_twitter> hi
[2018-02-21 12:59:26] <Cynede_twitter> gitter is completely broken for me for long time, github integration is broken, twitter integration is somehow working but either broken...
[2018-02-21 14:31:55] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> Cynede_twitter: define "broken". That could range anywhere fromthe colors don't match my keyboard to 
I cannot log in on my custom kernel linux with a rigorous blacklisting of hosts to 
fresh install windows on newest chrome without plugins doesn't work
[2018-02-22 06:41:07] <Cynede_twitter> pascalwhoop: when I try login with github Im getting some error - it just doesn't work, I can provide error if anyone interested, when I login with twitter it takes some old username, no avatar and I can't change anything
[2018-02-22 09:24:12] <aolko> hey there, any eta on mass "mark as read"?
[2018-02-22 10:36:34] <ghost~5539edbc15522ed4b3df7357> Cynede_twitter: sure provide the error, that will help
[2018-02-22 11:46:33] <archenroot> Hi folks, sorry for stupid question, but I named wrong the community when linking to organization and now I have now chance to rename it and I also cannot create new one as linked already to organization, how to resolve this?
[2018-02-22 11:49:26] <archenroot> I would like to rename Common Services here [<-LINK->] to something else, but there are no options to do this, I can remove rooms, but not the community...
[2018-02-22 17:40:09] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @Cynede_twitterI assume you are running into a E11000 duplicate key error. This usually happens after you have done some tricky renaming, see [<-LINK->] . Send an email tosupport@gitter.imexplaining the whole situation and and usernames that you have previously used and are currently using
[2018-02-22 17:41:28] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @aolkoThere is/mark-all-readfor the current room but not across all rooms. You can track [<-LINK->] which has no ETA but MR welcome
[2018-02-22 17:42:20] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @archenrootSend an email tosupport@gitter.imwith a link to the community and your new desired name
[2018-02-22 18:16:34] <ipatch> i thought gitter supported some HTML 5 markup, i.e. [<-CODE->] am I mistaken?
[2018-02-22 18:17:33] <MadLittleMods> ipatch: See [<-LINK->] 
[2018-02-22 18:19:28] <ipatch> damn, it’s been open for a year now, \(ツ)/
[2018-02-22 18:19:58] <w96k> is there github mirror of gitlab repo?
[2018-02-22 18:46:16] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @w96kno, the webapp is only available on GitLab, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-02-22 18:46:36] <w96k> thanks for the answer
[2018-02-22 22:22:55] <TallTed_twitter> wow, here's a fun one, just noticed in this channel even!@MadLittleModsissuetimestamp in your "points up" is 1 hour earlier from timestamp in targeted message.  (e.g.,  [<-LINK->] targets a message that shows as 13:19 for me, but your point-up says 12:19.)  Weirdly, my own point-up does the right thing.  I bet it's app-specific.  (I'm in Gitter.app v3.1.0 on macOS 10.10.5.)  Or maybe it's a symptom of TZ translations.  Still needs some addressing.
[2018-02-22 23:01:46] <TallTed_twitter> MadLittleMods: -  [<-LINK->] Gaining clarity on the issue, as I'm explaining use of point_up to others -- the problem is that the timestamp literal in the link is in the pointer's TZ, while the message timestamp in the spool is shown in each reader's TZ.  This suggests to me that it might be beneficial (at least as a user preference, at least in the OS-native apps) to put all timestamps into full ISO YYYY-MM-DDZhh:mm:ss notation, and to stick with UTC rather than localizing anywhere.
[2018-02-23 00:10:48] <FixelAlgorithms> Hello, Are all Communities Public?I created community to the organization and it is public while I'd like it to be private (Invitation only or by Email Domain). How can I do that?
[2018-02-23 00:12:12] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @TallTed_twitterSee [<-LINK->] 
[2018-02-23 00:13:00] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @FixelAlgorithmsCommunities on Gitter are public and there isn't a way to change it. But you can have private rooms under a community. The default "Lobby" room is public but you can delete it after you have your other rooms setup
[2018-02-23 00:31:42] <FixelAlgorithms> I see. So all communities are Public.
[2018-02-23 00:31:56] <FixelAlgorithms> Only rooms can be private.
[2018-02-23 00:32:14] <FixelAlgorithms> I thought it would be like Slack. Being able to have a private place.
[2018-02-23 12:28:22] <sylr> Hi
[2018-02-23 12:28:39] <sylr> I've just installed the windows gitter app on windows 10
[2018-02-23 12:28:56] <sylr> I'm unable to login as I get a black page when I click on github login
[2018-02-23 17:20:58] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @sylrDo you mean a "blank" page? Are you behind a proxy? [<-LINK->] 
[2018-02-24 00:45:55] <doublah> I get the same issue [<-LINK->] No proxy
[2018-02-25 20:28:44] <alipourm> Hi all, is there any limit in the number of REST API calls? I'm trying to dump the conversations in a room and I cannot get more than 5000 messages.
[2018-02-26 13:49:39] <Cynede_twitter> I can't disable notification
[2018-02-26 23:40:44] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @doublahYou can try to look at the Sawbuck logs to see what is happening, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-02-26 23:45:14] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @Cynede_twitterCan you be more specific? You could use/notify-muteor go to Room settings -> Notifications in the top-right of the chat header. Perhaps you are using the desktop app on macOS, see [<-LINK->] 
[2018-02-27 06:46:28] <Cynede_twitter> MadLittleMods: I can't completely disable notifications there, I can't login from github, my twitter stats are outdated, I can't change avatar and nickname, when I open notifications mail it shows two dialogs with notifications settings, everything feels like big broken mess
[2018-02-27 06:49:09] <Cynede_twitter> sent signed mail to support
[2018-02-27 15:56:44] <MadLittleMods> Cynede_twitter: I responded to the support ticket
[2018-02-27 16:49:39] <var2dan> I get the same issuesame issue here (windows 10) Twitter login works, Github login just shows an empty page
[2018-02-27 17:37:30] <TallTed_twitter> Seems inability to log in with github account is a broad issue.  I didn't raise it when I was first getting connected, because I was having plenty of other issues, but I'd much rather my gitter use (which is about github work) be connected to my github account than to my twitter account, even if those are also connected/connectable.
[2018-02-27 18:10:07] <MadLittleMods> @sylr @doublah @var2dan One of you mind creating an issue to track this?  https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/desktop/issues [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
[2018-02-27 18:43:32] <thehitechpanky> ps. gitter doesn't identify (y) as 
[2018-02-27 19:20:52] <BasixKOR> How do I disable unread message email?
[2018-02-27 19:21:53] <BasixKOR>  [<-LINK->] . never mind.
[2018-02-27 20:27:04] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @thehitechpankyWhich platforms do that substitution? It's unlikely to be added because we are probably going to get rid of the:)type shortcuts, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-02-28 20:24:41] <alexandred> Hey guys, I'm the developer of an open source driver for OS X ( [<-LINK->] ). I've been using gitter as a platform for discussions regarding the driver for the good part of 3 years now and I'm really happy with the service, thanks! I've been using a chat room attached to my own github account (gitter.im/alexandred/VoodooI2C) but i'd like to start using a gitter community attached to a github organisation i've set up specifically for the driver. The only issue is that someone (who has no relation to the project) appears to have taken the gitter name and is not using it whatsoever ( [<-LINK->] ) . The only accounts in that chat (apart from my own when I tried asking them if theyre using it) are empty Github accounts. I was wondering if the gitter staff could purge this empty community so that I could start using it for the right purpose?
[2018-02-28 20:26:32] <alexandred> It would be very useful considering that, currently, all development chat is interlaced with support chat and I'd like to be able to separate those out into two rooms
[2018-02-28 20:58:53] <MadLittleMods> alexandred: Send an email tosupport@gitter.imwith the details. Please also include a link to the new organisation you setup. [<-LINK->] looks like a user atm
[2018-03-01 09:16:31] <var2dan>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-03-01 09:17:12] <var2dan> looks like this is the reason I get blank page when trying to use github oauth (windows 10)
[2018-03-01 09:18:02] <var2dan> in the chrome browser the gitter.im works fine though
[2018-03-01 16:01:42] <MadLittleMods> var2dan: Thanks for the extra info. I created an issue to track this, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-03-02 03:21:04] <uthemus> Gitter profile picture at top right not updating from Github, although the chat picture has updated?
[2018-03-02 03:23:49] <MadLittleMods> @uthemus Signing out and signing back in to Gitter will update your info from GitHub.Your avatar in the roster (top-right) and in the chat match what you have on GitHub for me (orange/red background)
[2018-03-02 03:26:37] <uthemus> MadLittleMods: Tried that.  Avatar pics don't match.  Chat is updated.  OCD....taking over....
[2018-03-02 03:26:49] <uthemus> *twitch
[2018-03-02 03:27:08] <MadLittleMods> uthemus: You can try clearing your cache. What are the image sources for your chat avatar vs roster?
[2018-03-02 03:27:57] <uthemus> It's all Github I assume.  Not aware of any profile settings on Gitter in order to update avatar manually.
[2018-03-02 03:28:08] <uthemus> Will clear cache.  Standby...
[2018-03-02 03:30:56] <MadLittleMods> uthemus: By image sources, I meant, inspect element to open the the devtools and look for thesrc. This is what I am seeing for you and they are up to dateChat, https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/27595862?v=4&s=30

[2018-03-02 03:37:08] <uthemus> Hey sorry for the delay.  I angered the wifi when I cleared the cache.  Didn't work.  Let me check on the image sources.
[2018-03-02 03:41:24] <uthemus> <img id="profile-menu-avatar" src="https://avatars-04.gitter.im/gh/uv/4/uthemus" class="profile-menu__avatar">

[2018-03-02 03:42:32] <uthemus> But that's different than my chat (and Github) avatar.
[2018-03-02 03:42:39] <uthemus> That was the former picture
[2018-03-02 03:43:14] <MadLittleMods> It looks like this on GitHub and the previous links from Gitter look the same [<-LINK->] 
[2018-03-02 03:43:38] <uthemus>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-03-02 03:45:40] <uthemus> This is the roster.  Hasn't updated.
[2018-03-02 03:46:22] <MadLittleMods> Sorry, I wouldn't call that the roster, profile menu icon seems more accurate. The roster I was referring to was the list of people below. [<-CODE->] 
[2018-03-02 03:47:09] <MadLittleMods> It seems like you are using a browser by being able to clear the cache but just to make sure; Are you using the desktop client?
[2018-03-02 03:47:15] <uthemus> Got it..profile pic.  Thanks.  Hmm, maybe I'll sleep on it.  Sometimes that works.
[2018-03-02 03:47:39] <uthemus> I am, yes.
[2018-03-02 03:48:04] <MadLittleMods> You might just need to exit and bring the desktop client back up. I am not sure how you are clearing the cache within the desktop app
[2018-03-02 03:48:41] <uthemus> Safari, clear history.  Confirm in preferences.  Develop empty cache to go an unnecessary step further.
[2018-03-02 03:50:00] <MadLittleMods> Although the macOS client is Safari-based, I don't think clearing the cache in Safari will directly affect the desktop client. Plus you would need to refresh the desktop client after. Does exiting the desktop app and bringing it back up change things?
[2018-03-02 03:51:15] <uthemus> No, if by exiting you mean exiting Safari.
[2018-03-02 03:52:22] <uthemus> Tried signing out.  Signing in first with Github.  Signing in first to Gitter with Github.
[2018-03-02 03:57:18] <MadLittleMods> Sorry, I think we are crossing terminology. By desktop app, I mean the standalone desktop app [<-LINK->] . It sounds like you are accessing Gitter via the Safari browser. In any case, you have exhausted the obvious solutions and might just be best to check in tomorrow if you still have the problem
[2018-03-02 03:59:07] <uthemus> Ahhh. Roger again.  Ok, I'm going to sleep in.  Hopefully that works!
[2018-03-02 03:59:27] <uthemus> Thanks a bunch.
[2018-03-02 12:01:31] <holtzermann17> Hi, has MathJaX support been implemented yet?  If so, $x$ might render with italics.
[2018-03-02 12:02:10] <holtzermann17> Looks like it doesn't work yet!  Earlier discussion here: [<-LINK->] 
[2018-03-02 12:04:58] <holtzermann17> This would be really useful for my project, so I'd be keen to help get it working -- assuming I can be helpful.
[2018-03-02 13:09:34] <holtzermann17> I added MathJaX as an issue here, so that it doesn't get drowned out by noise: [<-LINK->] 
[2018-03-05 10:01:02] <boxsnake> Hi all. I am wondering if Gitter has a way to remove a community (which is created by myself)
[2018-03-05 10:03:10] <boxsnake> I created a community by accident, and now I want to delete it. However, I only found the button "Leave" rather than "Delete". After clicking "Leave", it is still in the community list when I create a room.
[2018-03-05 10:04:18] <boxsnake> Thanks in advance.
[2018-03-05 16:19:51] <MadLittleMods> boxsnake: There isn't a way to delete the community yourself in the UI but you can send an email tosupport@gitter.imwith the details and we can clean it up
[2018-03-05 18:12:08] <boxsnake> MadLittleMods: Got it, thanks.
[2018-03-05 22:00:54] <uthemus> MadLittleMods: Profile menu avatar never updated to match the chat and roster avatars from GitHub.  Not a big deal for me but thought you might like to know.
[2018-03-06 00:15:45] <MadLittleMods> uthemus: hmmm, I can reproduce now. I created [<-LINK->] to track this
[2018-03-06 00:23:30] <uthemus> MadLittleMods: nice.  tanks.
[2018-03-06 12:07:10] <xCASx> Hi guys. I have a qeustion about rendering issue. I see it for very long time. It's more than a year I think. And it is so ugly that I can't even imagine why it wasn't fixed yet. In some cases it is even preventing me from sending messages, just because unrolled URLs collide with typing area.And the worst thing is that in settings there is no option to disable URL preview. At least I didn't find it.
[2018-03-06 12:08:44] <xCASx> This is how it look like: [<-LINK->] 
[2018-03-06 12:11:45] <xCASx> This example is for github gist link. The same happens with tweets. Fortunately images are good.
[2018-03-06 12:29:03] <xCASx> And here how it looks like in action (gif 1.7Mb): [<-LINK->] You can see lot's of glitches at the beginning, when i switch from one channel to another and it starts to render unrolled links.
[2018-03-06 16:23:26] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @xCASxSee [<-LINK->] 
[2018-03-06 16:59:59] <charles-dyfis-net> Is "create community" actually the right thing to do, if I just want a single chat room associated with one public repository? It seems much more heavyweight.
[2018-03-06 17:03:35] <charles-dyfis-net> The public repository in question is [<-LINK->] ; I was expecting/hoping to just be able to navigate to that, but the 404 message talks about giving access to private repositories, which... not gonna' happen.
[2018-03-06 17:24:04] <ilanolkies> Hey! How can I use topics in mi channel??
[2018-03-06 17:24:37] <charles-dyfis-net> RSKilan: , ...from the blog post announcing them, I gather that they're not available for wider/public use yet.
[2018-03-06 17:44:21] <jacksonisiah> Is there a way to block direct messages?

[2018-03-06 19:42:28] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @xCASx [<-LINK->] has a workaround in the comments. We don't have bandwidth for every issue
[2018-03-08 01:40:27] <dgenr8> How do
[2018-03-08 01:41:08] <dgenr8> I clear the suggested rooms from the Android app
[2018-03-08 01:49:25] <boxsnake> dgenr8: I do not think there is a way to clear suggestions in App. You may "at" Gitter developers to ask if they can consider this feature in future app.
[2018-03-08 04:31:15] <dgenr8> Ok thanks!
[2018-03-08 11:58:43] <skaor> Hello everybody ! I'm new on Gitter. I try to connect with my github account to the windows application but when i click on the 'sign in with github" i just get a blank page
[2018-03-08 17:23:49] <MadLittleMods> skaor: See [<-LINK->] 
[2018-03-08 18:00:44] <cmseaton42> I cant login with the windows desktop app? I select login with github and the screen goes blank. Any thoughts on this?
[2018-03-08 18:04:09] <cmseaton42> nevermind, found the workaround

[2018-03-08 18:10:55] <Sebb767> Hey there :)I have a problem with Gitters mail notifications. I'd like to receive mails only when I'm mentioned (announcements are okay to). Still, even though my notifications are set to this, I regularly receive mails about missed messages and no mail when I'm mentioned. Turning the notifications fully off works, but then I don't receive any notification when I'm mentioned either.
[2018-03-08 18:11:05] <Sebb767> Do you have any idea how to fix this?
[2018-03-08 18:19:48] <Sebb767> Nevermind, I found [<-LINK->] . I hope someone fixes this soon :/
[2018-03-08 18:20:22] <skaor> thank@MadLittleMods
[2018-03-08 20:45:12] <rkitover> I have some kind of problem with the gitter android app, any channel I go to is a blank page, I tried clearing cache and data for the app, does not help
[2018-03-08 23:12:48] <MadLittleMods> @rkitover This is the only issue I could find that is slightly related, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/941Mind creating a new issue with some more details, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues
[2018-03-09 05:47:09] <ghost~5928d90bd73408ce4f629b9e> Gitter has the most terrible UI
[2018-03-09 05:48:44] <ghost~5928d90bd73408ce4f629b9e> Gitter search bar is the worst

[2018-03-10 12:20:47] <nikitavoloboev> How can I change the room name fromLobbyto something else
[2018-03-10 12:21:01] <nikitavoloboev> I want to change it togithub-org/repo-nameinstead
[2018-03-10 12:21:07] <nikitavoloboev> I can't find anywhere how to do it
[2018-03-10 14:46:40] <JohnOH> Is the Android app for Gitter still current?
[2018-03-10 14:47:30] <JohnOH> I have some kind of problem with the gitter android app, any channel I go to is a blank page, I tried clearing cache and data for the app, does not helpMe too, started failing a few days ago.
[2018-03-10 14:48:16] <JohnOH> Appears to be lots of internet traffic but never shows the page.

[2018-03-11 05:15:43] <Alann200> Like this : [<-LINK->] 
[2018-03-11 05:47:30] <TecMunky> I have the same problem.  Has anyone figured out how to get my gitter back?
[2018-03-11 09:11:31] <boxsnake> DEVviL0: It's Markdown text's code block. Either a indent of whole code block, or use three ` to open/close block.
[2018-03-11 09:12:12] <boxsnake> ` is not quote, it's the key left to 1, under Esc.
[2018-03-11 09:16:09] <boxsnake> DEVviL0: Moreover, for ` to start/end a code block, you have to start it with a new line. Otherwise, it will not work.
[2018-03-11 09:16:35] <boxsnake> e.g```Your code```
[2018-03-11 09:17:49] <Alann200> Ok
[2018-03-11 09:18:32] <Alann200>  [<-CODE->] 
[2018-03-11 09:18:40] <boxsnake> You got it.
[2018-03-11 09:18:54] <boxsnake> You can also write language name after `
[2018-03-11 09:19:07] <boxsnake> ```javascript
[2018-03-11 09:19:13] <boxsnake> Like this.
[2018-03-11 09:23:42] <Alann200> Okay thanks
[2018-03-12 08:38:39] <iraklisg> JohnOH: same issue here on android 7  Does anybody knows if there is a workaround for this issue or if it is a confirmed bug ?
[2018-03-12 08:39:29] <vegegoku> yup the android app isnt working
[2018-03-12 10:00:28] <JohnOH> iraklisg: A number of people share our problem but I haven't seen any recognition of the issue yet.
[2018-03-12 11:04:51] <dkirrane> How do I search a specific room for my messages and any responses to those
[2018-03-12 11:52:35] <vegegoku> dkirrane: Select the room then click the search icon on the left, and type the words you want to search
[2018-03-12 13:29:24] <martinklaus2_twitter> Gitter isn't loading the rooms on Android app, some ideas?
[2018-03-12 14:03:47] <vegegoku> it have bean broken for few days, 3 i guess
[2018-03-12 14:03:56] <vegegoku> and no response regarding this yet
[2018-03-12 14:15:09] <martinklaus2_twitter> All Android User has this Problem? Or all app user? You know if Desktop app is working?
[2018-03-12 14:15:37] <boxsnake> Mine is fine.
[2018-03-12 14:16:39] <martinklaus2_twitter> boxsnake: App version and Android version?
[2018-03-12 14:17:47] <boxsnake> Android 8.0 (Oreo). App 3.1.1
[2018-03-12 14:18:25] <martinklaus2_twitter> boxsnake: Have the same situation, thanks.
[2018-03-12 14:19:01] <boxsnake> Did you get blank page?
[2018-03-12 14:19:07] <martinklaus2_twitter> yes
[2018-03-12 14:19:21] <boxsnake> Not the same situation, mine is fine.
[2018-03-12 14:19:38] <boxsnake> Quite different.
[2018-03-12 14:20:00] <martinklaus2_twitter> Same basis i mean
[2018-03-12 14:21:00] <vegegoku> i am on android version 7.0 and gitter version 3.1.1

[2018-03-12 15:22:28] <arcanck> Hi, guys!
[2018-03-12 15:24:33] <arcanck> I have a question about Gitter. Can someone help me? I created a community using a URL. Then I deleted this community. But it still exists. Only I'm not the owner anymore. How is this possible? Does it take time to actually be excluded?
[2018-03-12 15:29:25] <boxsnake> I asked it, some one told me to send email to request cleanup.
[2018-03-12 15:47:47] <uthemus> MadLittleMods: Check it out!
[2018-03-12 16:42:55] <dgenr8> Desktop app shows white screen after choosing "Login with github"
[2018-03-12 16:43:03] <dgenr8> This is on windows
[2018-03-12 16:47:49] <boxsnake>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-03-12 16:48:00] <boxsnake> A workaround
[2018-03-12 16:54:50] <dgenr8> Thanks@boxsnakeI'll wait for fix if it avoids storing token in the fs
[2018-03-13 08:33:03] <mygitter5634> how do I disconnect my github user from a gitter channel?
[2018-03-13 08:43:37] <swarnk> sorry for that noise )
[2018-03-13 09:42:54] <mygitter5634> anyone? (I have 2 github accounts && I want to disconnect one of them from gitter and only leave the other
[2018-03-13 10:07:15] <swarnk> maybe: profile-applications-Authorized OAuth Apps
[2018-03-13 10:07:47] <swarnk> and Revoke of course

[2018-03-13 11:22:05] <mygitter5634> is there a 'gitter account settings' anywhere in 'http:/gitter.im' ?
[2018-03-13 21:17:04] <kpr001_twitter> Hi
[2018-03-13 21:17:19] <kpr001_twitter> How can I pm to some one please guide me
[2018-03-13 21:17:34] <kpr001_twitter> I'm new in gitter
[2018-03-13 21:19:19] <vegegoku> Click on his profile image then select private message
[2018-03-13 21:20:02] <kpr001_twitter> I'm on mobile is this working?
[2018-03-13 21:20:36] <vegegoku> For desktop app
[2018-03-13 21:21:29] <vegegoku> In mobile i think you can do it if you are using the browser and select desktop site
[2018-03-13 22:22:09] <luisvt> Hello my gitter is not showing the messages on Android
[2018-03-13 22:22:21] <luisvt> What could be the reason?
[2018-03-13 22:27:12] <luisvt> Is there a way to get any error message?
[2018-03-14 00:56:41] <mstellaluna> I have a quick question. Is there a way to block a person in gitter from contacting you via IM? i don't seem to find any info.. I'm assuming no but just want to confirm
[2018-03-14 01:00:22] <JeffLabonte> Hey guys!
[2018-03-14 01:00:40] <JeffLabonte> Has anyone used Gitter app on Linux with a 4k screen?
[2018-03-14 01:05:47] <JeffLabonte> Well, I finally found the solution on Linux. I had to simple add --force-device-scale-factor=2 to the exec line in the .desktop file
[2018-03-14 02:39:55] <ketan> Hi — I'm also having issues with the android app described above (blank screen). Anyone know if there's a fix that'll be pushed out soon.
[2018-03-14 05:12:50] <edmundedgar> Same problem here on android, I get notifications about new comments but clicking on a room results in a blank page.
[2018-03-14 06:42:47] <loewenstein> Same here, just gave a single star for the app because of it
[2018-03-14 09:49:13] <mygitter5634> is there a 'gitter account settings' anywhere in ' [<-LINK->] ' ?
[2018-03-14 09:54:08] <alecthomas> i'm also having the blank screen issue on android
[2018-03-14 14:59:38] <MSripadarao_twitter> /join #datahaskell
[2018-03-14 15:05:36] <ochrons> got the same blank room problem on Android with 3.1.1
[2018-03-14 15:29:46] <cbj4074> Just off-the-cuff, and based on other recent issues people have noticed, that "blank screen" issue seems like a TLS issue of some variety.
[2018-03-14 15:31:04] <cbj4074> Android 3.1.1 is ancient (2011), so I would be surprised to find its CA store even remotely useful 7 years later.
[2018-03-14 15:41:16] <davesque> Me too with the blank page issue.  Can't use the android app at all.  Every chat room just shows that blank page.
[2018-03-14 15:41:50] <davesque> And I don't think it's an old CA.  I'm on that latest version of Android on a Pixel 2 phone.
[2018-03-14 15:42:49] <cbj4074> davesque: Ahh, okay. Very interesting. That does indeed seem to rule-out CA certs.
[2018-03-14 15:44:55] <cbj4074> Interesting to note that the Android app appears not to have been updated since Nov 10, 2016 (that's the date shown in the Play Store).
[2018-03-14 15:45:17] <davesque> Hmm…that’s an awfully long time ago.
[2018-03-14 15:45:17] <cbj4074> My point is simply that it's not as though Gitter rolled-out an update to the app that broke everything, which implies that something changed server-side.
[2018-03-14 15:45:28] <davesque> sure
[2018-03-14 15:49:43] <davesque> I guess there’s an issue open for this on Gitlab which is good.
[2018-03-14 15:49:52] <cbj4074> Let's give it a million thumbs-ups
[2018-03-14 15:49:58] <cbj4074> Got a link for it?
[2018-03-14 15:50:20] <davesque>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-03-14 15:50:48] <davesque> it’s also in the activity bar on the right of the chat log (not sure if you can see that with whatever client you’re using)
[2018-03-14 16:22:10] <cbj4074>  Thanks for the link@davesque
[2018-03-14 20:44:01] <mantaro301_twitter> Name Test. I think it will show up a name that i inserted to twitter years ago, when i created the account, but it seems, that it was saved somewhere and gitter can see and display it. Does anyone faced the same problem as I?
[2018-03-14 20:44:47] <mantaro301_twitter> And yes. Even my old twitter name is used. Although i changed it a few months ago :/
[2018-03-14 22:24:07] <subtuppel> My android client shows only blank pages recently, anyone else with the issue? Maybe due to webview/play services updates?
[2018-03-14 22:25:06] <davesque> yeah a lot of people have been mentioning it.  there's an open issue ticket a little further up in the chat log.
[2018-03-14 22:25:25] <subtuppel> ah sorry, just saw the link above, thanks
[2018-03-14 22:26:13] <subtuppel> I was unsure if the combination of all my privacy tools could be the reason all of a sudden (afirewall+, xprivacy, servicely etc. pp)
[2018-03-14 22:26:45] <davesque> don't think so.  i don't use anything fancy on my phone and i'm getting the same thing.
[2018-03-14 22:27:15] <subtuppel> So my guess regarding google dependencies seems right... both webview and play services updated b4 it started
[2018-03-14 22:27:55] <davesque> hmm...yeah must be something related to that i bet
[2018-03-14 22:28:05] <davesque> more likely the webview component update
[2018-03-14 22:28:10] <davesque> would be my guess
[2018-03-14 22:28:51] <subtuppel> I'll check if that's the reason tomorrow, got the older versions backed up but gtg to bed now.. have a nice evening/good night!
[2018-03-15 14:05:35] <subtuppel> Alright, to anyone who has the same problem: webview v. 64 fixes it. Available at apkmirror.com
[2018-03-15 14:06:08] <subtuppel> 65 beta versions not tested, 65 final causes the bug
[2018-03-15 14:27:32] <radu-munteanu> Hi, is there any plan for an RPM package release for the gitter.im desktop client?
[2018-03-15 16:02:16] <davesque> i'm not familiar with how gitter is managed and updated.  is there a team of core devs that maintain it?  is there a company or organization that supports its development?
[2018-03-15 16:30:42] <radu-munteanu> davesque: Gitter was bought by GitLab last year [<-LINK->] 
[2018-03-15 16:31:20] <davesque> i see.  so the gitlab folks are essentially responsible for maintaining it?
[2018-03-15 16:32:27] <radu-munteanu> I guess it's still the team who made Gitter initially plus people from GitLab, as GitLab, from what I've read, wants to make an open source version.
[2018-03-15 16:32:41] <davesque> mkay
[2018-03-15 16:41:33] <cbj4074> That is basically my understanding as well.
[2018-03-15 17:25:44] <arcanck> How I delete a room?
[2018-03-15 17:25:54] <arcanck> Or a community?
[2018-03-15 19:59:38] <mcarpenterjr> davesque: That's pretty wild, so what happens to the relationship that gitlab built with Mattermost?
[2018-03-15 20:09:26] <bew> I also have the issue with the android app for the last few days, is there an issue tracker I can report this to?
[2018-03-15 20:10:32] <bew> Nvm found the link above
[2018-03-15 20:17:28] <subtuppel> bew: Rollback to webview 64.x solves it
[2018-03-15 20:19:04] <bew> Is that an app? Maybe it got updated when I updated chrome
[2018-03-15 20:21:13] <bew> Can you mention it on the issues about it?
[2018-03-15 20:27:24] <vegegoku> It might be better to change gitter into a PWA
[2018-03-15 21:02:01] <cbj4074> bew: I, too, am confused as to which piece of software on my phone was updated to cause this. It sure as hell wasn't the OS, because LG has seen to it that it hasn't had an update in nearly a year.
[2018-03-15 21:07:53] <stavlor> cbj4074: Probably just Webview components
[2018-03-15 21:08:06] <subtuppel> Yes, as I said
[2018-03-15 21:08:15] <cbj4074> stavlor: How would those get updated, though? Like, which app? Something from the Play Store?
[2018-03-15 21:08:45] <stavlor> cbj4074: Play Store Probably automatically updated you as it is the default behavior
[2018-03-15 21:08:53] <cbj4074> I see, okay, thanks 
[2018-03-15 22:03:34] <dreinhold>  [<-LINK->] good to see someone from gitter finally looking at the 6 day old ticket that the android app has been broken ;)
[2018-03-15 22:59:36] <bew> I tried to downgrade the webview app, but doesn't look like to do anything..
[2018-03-15 23:12:56] <bew> Actually I can't downgrade it.. Will wait for a fix then
[2018-03-16 06:52:51] <amosbird> Hi
[2018-03-16 06:53:09] <amosbird> why does gitter keep joining me back to leaved rooms?
[2018-03-16 16:05:18] <hulkish> hi, i cant seem to load any messages on gitter android app, anyone else?
[2018-03-16 16:05:39] <hulkish> ive tried everything...clearing app data/cache, reinstalling
[2018-03-16 16:05:45] <hulkish> no luck
[2018-03-16 16:06:06] <luisvt> it was already reported: [<-LINK->] 
[2018-03-16 16:06:54] <hulkish> oh, ok ty
[2018-03-16 16:30:39] <stavlor> it was reported/fixed but fix is a bit delayed in getting pushed to Google play.
[2018-03-17 00:39:03] <bew> Yay gitter app updated, problem gone thank you ;)
[2018-03-17 04:16:39] <JoEeeezy_twitter> i wish gitter had a "dark mode"  >_>
[2018-03-17 04:17:00] <bew> there's one
[2018-03-17 04:17:11] <JoEeeezy_twitter> really? how do i activate it ?
[2018-03-17 04:17:24] <bew> click on your profile picture
[2018-03-17 04:17:29] <JoEeeezy_twitter> i tried manually changing css using a chrome extension but it sucks
[2018-03-17 04:17:35] <JoEeeezy_twitter> wow
[2018-03-17 04:17:38] <bew> :)
[2018-03-17 04:17:50] <bew> there's an option to activate dark mode there
[2018-03-17 04:17:51] <JoEeeezy_twitter> fml this whole time i'm looking way too deep
[2018-03-17 04:17:58] <JoEeeezy_twitter> in settings... css. etc.
[2018-03-17 04:17:59] <JoEeeezy_twitter> lol
[2018-03-17 04:18:02] <JoEeeezy_twitter> thanks alot

[2018-03-17 14:09:35] <mygitter5634> can I stop gitter from notifying me about new messages by mail?

[2018-03-17 17:07:12] <BobbyKitten> Hi, maybe it is a stupid question, but is it possible to make new line in gitter for Android?
[2018-03-18 00:56:15] <JoEeeezy_twitter> mygitter5634:  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-03-18 00:56:36] <JoEeeezy_twitter> you have to do that for every room you're subscribed too though
[2018-03-18 03:42:13] <alecthomas> thanks for fixing the android client!
[2018-03-18 09:56:53] <Lite5h4dow> Has anyone else noticed the gitter app not working?
[2018-03-18 09:57:15] <Lite5h4dow> It just shows a white screen when you load a chat
[2018-03-18 20:32:34] <jisuxk_twitter> how do i logout gitter desktop(MAC) ?
[2018-03-19 13:11:30] <tommck> Lite5h4dow: yeah.. the windows desktop app stopped working for me a couple days ago
[2018-03-19 13:15:03] <tommck> I even uninstalled and reinstalled and it's not working
[2018-03-19 15:01:03] <cbj4074> Lite5h4dow:  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-03-19 15:01:38] <cbj4074> (make sure you are on version 3.1.2)
[2018-03-19 15:09:08] <tommck> cbj4074: I uninstalled and installed latest... same problem
[2018-03-19 15:09:26] <tommck> I get the blank page after clicking the login w/ github button
[2018-03-19 15:09:41] <cbj4074> tommck: Just noticed that you were referring to the Windows version... my bad. The above issue is exlusive to Android. Hmm...
[2018-03-19 15:09:57] <cbj4074> (and the latest version on Windows is 3.1.0)

[2018-03-19 15:11:13] <cbj4074> Yep, was just about to paste the same link. Sounds like the issue you are having.
[2018-03-19 15:11:55] <tommck> yeah... might not bother fixing it for now... too busy
[2018-03-19 18:13:55] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @dkirraneYou can usefrom:dkirranesyntax to find your own messages
[2018-03-19 18:15:18] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @dgenr8There is unlikely to be a fix soon. If your sign in with GitHub, the token is stored there anyway
[2018-03-19 18:17:34] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @mygitter5634There isn't a way to disconnect completely but you can change the admins for the room via room settings -> Permissions, [<-LINK->] , [<-LINK->]

[2018-03-19 18:22:09] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @radu-munteanuNo plans but there is this, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-03-19 18:23:14] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @davesque@radu-munteanuThe webapp is already open source here, [<-LINK->] but there are many more pieces that need to be made public
[2018-03-19 18:23:55] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @arcanckThere isn't a way to delete a community in the UI but you can send a message tosupport@gitter.imwith the details and links
[2018-03-19 18:28:35] <MadLittleMods>  March 16, 2018 1:52 AM @amosbird Is this with the IRC bridge? We auto-join some rooms that you already joined in the webapp.If you are mentioned in a room, you will be added to it again
[2018-03-19 18:30:09] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @mygitter5634Unreads are tied to emails currently so you have to unsubscribe or adjust your notification settings to "Mute". See [<-LINK->]

Sorry for the troubles, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-03-19 18:35:32] <stavlor> MadLittleMods: indeed, working well thanks for fixing it.
[2018-03-19 18:37:18] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @nikitavoloboevFirst create thegithub-orgcommunity on Gitter that is associated with the GitHub org(not the repo). Then click the "Add a room" button at the bottom of the room list, select thegithub-orgcommunity, and type in the name of the repo which will auto-associate or appear in the typeahead. If you don't see the repo in the typeahead, see [<-LINK->] 
[2018-03-19 18:41:10] <looca1> hey
[2018-03-19 18:41:24] <looca1> is there something like gitter except not so segregated?
[2018-03-19 18:41:42] <looca1> hold up
[2018-03-19 18:42:23] <looca1> I'm probably talking about Twitter? Is there gitter-like programming talk on Twitter though? I've never actively used it.
[2018-03-19 18:44:21] <vegegoku> MadLittleMods: thank you very much
[2018-03-19 18:45:13] <JohnOH> MadLittleMods: Thanks, it nows a treat. 
[2018-03-19 20:31:50] <Lite5h4dow> MadLittleMods: Excellent job dude works a charm
[2018-03-19 20:33:28] <MadLittleMods> Lite5h4dow: Props goes to@suprememoocowwho fixed it up and made the release while I was on vacation, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-03-20 13:42:41] <ljhade24_twitter> Gitter show me blank page when I click github login button on windows 10 anyone having this issue?
[2018-03-20 13:53:42] <stavlor> Not having an issue here.
[2018-03-20 14:30:22] <JeffLabonte> MadLittleMods: Thank you! I have had already found a fix for my problem.
[2018-03-20 20:28:11] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @ljhade24_twitterSee [<-LINK->] 
[2018-03-20 22:40:55] <fterbo> Is there any chance that gitter will offer authentication that isn't based on other sites?
[2018-03-21 01:12:50] <MadLittleMods> @fterbo There aren't any plansAs a little aside, I really like the sign in with email option here, https://www.keybr.com/account
[2018-03-21 01:14:12] <MadLittleMods> Any non-OAuth sign in option would come after we decouple Gitter usernames from OAuth service(GitHub/Twitter)
[2018-03-21 09:32:03] <fiedl> Hi, does anyone know if there is a way toauthenticate for gitter through our own oauth provider? Currently, we are embedding our gitter channel on the status page for our sites and I would like our users to be able to reply right there without github or twitter account.
[2018-03-21 12:37:38] <pnkfelix> I have a problem: someone posted a link to a gist in a channel, and its automatically rendering the gist in a manner that it covers up all the comments that people added below the gist
[2018-03-21 12:40:22] <pnkfelix> 
[2018-03-21 12:42:16] <pnkfelix> ah, it seems like the "collapse" command on the options for that message makes the image mostly go away. (There are still some artifacts in the my own text entry box, but I'm guessing that's some sort of refresh bug.)
[2018-03-21 17:11:00] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @fiedlWe only support GitHub/Twitter OAuth for authenatication
[2018-03-21 17:11:25] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @pnkfelixSounds like you may be running into [<-LINK->] 
[2018-03-21 20:02:52] <fiedl> Thanks,@MadLittleMods
[2018-03-22 16:58:19] <sk1p> Hey, I have some feedback on the Android client. I started to type a message, then switched to another app, lost my connection and switched back. I got the "no connection" view, and lost the message (the input area was empty, and didn't fill up again after coming back online)

[2018-03-22 18:54:28] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @uthemusI don't think it is resolved. It's an intermittent nginx or GitHub issue
[2018-03-22 19:10:49] <sk1p> MadLittleMods: issue filed: [<-LINK->] 
[2018-03-24 05:52:17] <alecthomas> hello. i've set up GitLab webhooks for Gitter, but i see 5 xGitLab | undefined pushed to ...when i push a commit to gitlab, with one successfulGitLab | Alec Thomas pushed 1 commits to ...
[2018-03-24 05:52:22] <alecthomas> is that a known bug?
[2018-03-24 09:58:00] <fba4ceb5d65644d_twitter> I need a help ..I login with my twitter account but the username shown on my gitter profile that is not my twitter username .Then how to change gitter username
[2018-03-26 22:11:09] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @alecthomasI've seen it before but it isn't being tracked. Mind creating an issue? [<-LINK->] (PR welcome)
[2018-03-26 22:11:33] <alecthomas> MadLittleMods: for sure
[2018-03-26 22:13:12] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @fba4ceb5d65644d_twitterSend a message tosupport@gitter.imwith the details (old username and new username). You might be running into [<-LINK->] 
[2018-03-27 03:47:54] <alecthomas> MadLittleMods: i'm not sure that this is a problem with gitter though, it could be a gitlab issue
[2018-03-27 04:52:10] <MadLittleMods> alecthomas: The GitLab API response probably changed but it's still good to track it on the Gitter side to update the service/integration to match the new response shape. You can see the test for it here, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-03-27 20:23:16] <chrisvanoort_twitter> Is Gitter available for in-house installation for use with Git servers internal to an enterprise?Is there a glitter integration with GIT on TFS?
[2018-03-28 02:21:32] <TallTed_twitter> MadLittleMods: Hey, take a look at the right-side ACTIVITY div!  Eleventeen mysterious "GitLab | undefined pushed to webapp" tells no-one anything.  That seems rather less than useful.
[2018-03-28 08:07:25] <ghost~5ab04790d73408ce4f92282c> Is there an integration with Zeplin? Trying to move off Slack but I'm missing the update messages for design changes in Zeplin
[2018-03-28 08:19:51] <ghost~5ab04790d73408ce4f92282c> If one doesn't exist, can I develop one?
[2018-03-28 08:31:06] <fterbo> Is there any way to disable the avatar bar on the right hand side of the window?
[2018-03-28 15:48:26] <MadLittleMods>  March 27, 2018 3:23 PM @chrisvanoort_twitter The webapp is open source so you can run it in-house but we don't offer any support or specific docs on setting up a more production-like setup, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webappI don't know of a Team Foundation Server integration and I don't see any issue about it (feel free to create one), https://github.com/gitterHQ/services/issues
[2018-03-28 15:51:17] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @TallTed_twitterThis was reported recently, [<-ISSUE->] . No ETA but is something I want to tackle at some point (PR welcome as well)
[2018-03-28 15:52:26] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @jasperamorgan_twitterI don't see a Zeplin integration yet. You can develop one via this guide, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-03-28 15:52:59] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @fterboNo, the roster is always visible
[2018-03-28 16:53:01] <fterbo> hrmph, ok, I guess maybe I can tweak my proxy to block it
[2018-03-28 16:54:16] <MadLittleMods> fterbo: If you want to customize that sort of thing, you could use a browser extension to add a little bit of CSS to hide it
[2018-03-29 07:22:10] <elia> I'm having trouble with re-creating a community for https://github.com/keycastr, after I deleted a room in it the community disappeared and I'm now unable to create a community linked to the project whatever the name I use. (permission in the individual org has been granted, and I already checked support.gitter.im without success). Is this the right place to ask?
[2018-03-29 07:46:43] <MadLittleMods> @elia The community still exists, https://gitter.im/keycastr/homeI created a dummy Lobby room you can join and create your actual desired rooms, https://gitter.im/keycastr/LobbyThis can happen when you don't have any room membership for that community. Mind creating an issue? https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issuesRelated codehttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/e8f819094df505e26423723327c5b6245a210a60/modules/groups/lib/group-membership-service.js#L62

[2018-03-29 07:47:26] <elia> MadLittleMods: will do! thank you very much!
[2018-03-29 08:10:04] <aydwi> I'm having a little problem with a bot account I'm trying to test on Gitter. Earlier it was working fine on a test channel I created, but now whatever message it posts, either via command line or directly through browser, the message is not getting saved.
[2018-03-29 08:11:11] <aydwi> When I try to edit it, it always shows a red outline. If I refresh, the message is gone. I've checked my network connectivity which is okay. Can someone help me with this
[2018-03-29 08:11:23] <aydwi> I'll remove my question if this is not the right place to ask
[2018-03-29 14:48:37] <cbj4074> aydwi: Seems more likely that you're being throttled. This is probably the best place to ask, and I suspect@MadLittleModswill be able to point you in the right direction.
[2018-03-29 15:04:40] <aydwi> cbj4074: This is the GitHub account: [<-LINK->] 
[2018-03-29 15:05:01] <aydwi> Not sure why is it getting throttled
[2018-03-29 15:06:42] <cbj4074> aydwi: Could just be the frequency and type of message... I'm not sure how throttling works, but I've seen other instances here in which peoples' bots have been throttled or similar for various reasons. Hopefully a Gitter dev is along shortly and can explain what's happening.
[2018-03-29 15:39:40] <MadLittleMods>  March 29, 2018 3:10 AM @aydwi Your account was blocked by our spam detection for saying the same message over and over.I have unblocked the account but it could still run into the same problem again. You will need to vary up the messages a bit
[2018-03-29 16:01:53] <aydwi> MadLittleMods: Thanks a lot! It is working now.I'll make sure not to test it with same messages again
[2018-03-30 02:18:27] <Scrappy-Dev> Hello. I am new to gitter and I came here to make my own community. I could have easily made a Discord Server, but I chose gitter instead. Can someone re assure me I made the right choice and why? Thanks
[2018-03-30 05:22:30] <mnasafi> Scrappy-Dev: : welcome to gitter. My team is also Discord currently and I am slowly getting them to switch over to Gitter. You made the right choice. Discord lacks many features that Gitter has such as code formatting, gitHub integration, Latex, etc.
[2018-03-30 05:23:31] <mnasafi> checkout the markdown section.. something missing in discord
[2018-03-30 08:26:42] <ghost~58b61b72d73408ce4f4d933b> Hi there, anyone knows the best way to send self-made gif on gitter?
[2018-03-30 08:27:08] <ghost~58b61b72d73408ce4f4d933b> Those gifs might be hundreds of megabytes.
[2018-03-30 08:28:48] <ghost~58b61b72d73408ce4f4d933b> So if I just upload it to imgur and send with![](link from imgur), it might take a long time to load.
[2018-03-30 08:30:05] <ghost~58b61b72d73408ce4f4d933b> I noticed that other apps might convert gifs into short videos, because of compression.
[2018-03-30 08:30:36] <ghost~58b61b72d73408ce4f4d933b> And play that video with nonstop loops.
[2018-03-30 08:31:09] <ghost~58b61b72d73408ce4f4d933b> Actually there's no difference for user experience.
[2018-03-30 08:32:05] <ghost~58b61b72d73408ce4f4d933b> I wonder whether there are similar mechanisms in Gitter
[2018-03-30 08:34:12] <ghost~58b61b72d73408ce4f4d933b> As I finally convinced my friend to use Gitter as daily IM, however, they complained a lot that there's no elegant way to send animations.
[2018-03-30 09:24:39] <MadLittleMods> TommyJerryMairo: Inline image syntax is the best way to go imo![alt text](link-here)but it doesn't support webm videos. You might be able to find a service that embeds(we use some version of [<-LINK->] ) but I tried imgur, gfycat, and giphy with no luck. Mind posting an issue? [<-LINK->] 
[2018-03-30 17:08:14] <Daenyth> hey
[2018-03-30 17:08:18] <Daenyth> is there a bug tracker?
[2018-03-30 17:08:23] <Daenyth> gist links make the desktop client unusable
[2018-03-30 17:08:26] <Daenyth> and it's been that way for a long time
[2018-03-30 17:12:35] <mcarpenterjr>  [<-LINK->] ?
[2018-03-30 17:12:54] <mcarpenterjr> looks like they've migrated from github
[2018-03-30 17:38:08] <cbj4074> Daenyth: Can you elaborate at all? I'm just curious to which aspect of the behavior you're referring, as another user.
[2018-03-30 17:38:46] <cbj4074> Ultimately, I'm wondering if "collapsing" the Gist "fixes" the issue, or if you're referring to another behavior.
[2018-03-30 17:38:55] <Daenyth>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-03-30 17:39:18] <Daenyth> I don't see any collapse option
[2018-03-30 17:41:25] <cbj4074> Gotcha, thank you for clarifying. I seemed to recall all embedable content having the option to collapse, but maybe I'm remembering that wrong, or the implementation is different on Mac OS (which I assume to be your OS).
[2018-03-30 17:41:54] <Daenyth> slack has collapsing
[2018-03-30 17:42:00] <Daenyth> I've never seen it on gitter, even on the website
[2018-03-30 17:42:04] <Daenyth> could be wrong
[2018-03-30 17:42:58] <Daenyth> ok hey, there it is
[2018-03-30 17:43:02] <Daenyth> that's actually very helpful
[2018-03-30 17:53:58] <cbj4074> Hehe, so thereisa collapse option after all for the Gist?
[2018-03-30 17:54:22] <cbj4074> By no means a "fix" or an ideal behavior, but at least it's a "workaround".
[2018-03-30 21:00:15] <MadLittleMods>  March 30, 2018 12:08 PM @Daenyth Tracked by https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/desktop/issues/211 [<-CODE->]

[2018-04-01 20:46:14] <0xa1ch3mist_twitter> I see that I am the only one without an avatar. Even though my twitter has a profile picture, it doesn't get updated in gitter.
[2018-04-01 20:46:39] <0xa1ch3mist_twitter> I gave it enough time to update. more than 3 months without an avatar.
[2018-04-02 07:10:41] <aydwi> Somewhat similar case with me. Updated my Github avatar, but Gitter still shows the older one at some places. It's been a week.
[2018-04-02 15:22:13] <jewilki1> hey guys
[2018-04-02 19:19:59] <sinuslebastisan_twitter> is there a dark mode/theme for gitter?

[2018-04-02 19:36:05] <sinuslebastisan_twitter> how do i enable it?
[2018-04-02 19:36:34] <sinuslebastisan_twitter> also can i have it enabled by default on embed?
[2018-04-02 19:42:54] <stavlor> Click your profile pic in the upper right and hit toggle dark mode

[2018-04-03 19:44:47] <HH0718> Okay, just saw this: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/desktop/issues/231Any workarounds?
[2018-04-03 19:48:37] <cbj4074> HH0718: Yeah, follow the section calledWorkaroundin that Issue. ;)
[2018-04-03 19:53:53] <HH0718> Hi@cbj4074Thanks, I have been using the workaround method (sounds dirty) but unfortunately typing anything in the console does nothing.
[2018-04-03 19:56:16] <cbj4074> HH0718: I would avoid that method. Use the other one, whereby you simply editgitter_preferences.json.
[2018-04-03 19:56:23] <cbj4074> On Windows, the file isC:\Users\YOUR USERNAME\AppData\Local\Gitter\gitter_preferences.json
[2018-04-03 19:57:00] <cbj4074> If you scroll down to the comments, there's an example of the edit you need to make to that file.
[2018-04-03 19:57:20] <HH0718> Ah, thank you, I will give it a try.
[2018-04-03 19:57:35] <cbj4074> No problem, let us know if it doesn't work for you 
[2018-04-03 19:59:05] <0xa1ch3mist_twitter> MadLittleMods: I tried signing out and signing in a lot of time. Still no luck with updating the avatar. Even if the avatar doesn't update from twitter, why is there no avatar at all? Its just blank.
[2018-04-03 20:01:54] <cbj4074> alchemist_et_twitter: I don't see a blank avatar for you. It's a little Gitter logo. The contrast is horrible (white on gray), so it almost looks like a gray square, but you do have one. Not terribly helpful, I know.
[2018-04-03 20:04:37] <0xa1ch3mist_twitter>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-03 20:04:39] <0xa1ch3mist_twitter> Oh is it? Its just blank on my machine. I am not a fan of the cosmetics. But in channels, people tend to miss my messages thinking it is a continuation of the previous person's message.
[2018-04-03 20:07:31] <cbj4074> Ahh, yeah, that's not what I see. I'm using the Dark theme, which may not make any difference, but I'd be curious to see if it changes the behavior for you.
[2018-04-03 20:07:48] <cbj4074> There's also some kind of CSS bug whereby the avatar is "invisible", as in your screenshot, until you mouse over it (or some part of the adjacent message, I can't remember which)
[2018-04-03 20:08:34] <cbj4074> Here's what I see:
[2018-04-03 20:08:39] <cbj4074>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-03 20:09:04] <cbj4074> All said, the damn thing should just work, though. :)
[2018-04-03 20:22:41] <HH0718>  [<-CODE->] Thank you.
[2018-04-03 20:22:58] <cbj4074> HH0718: Great! No problem, glad that fixed it for you. 
[2018-04-03 20:48:33] <MadLittleMods>  April 3, 2018 2:59 PM @alchemist_et_twitterYou might be running into https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/1834. Send an email to support@gitter.imhttps://gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter?at=5ac3c7f02dfcfffd2b2c1541
[2018-04-03 20:51:23] <MadLittleMods> alchemist_et_twitter: Your avatar might be showing as blank because what we have saved, [<-LINK->] just 404's
[2018-04-04 01:48:28] <0xa1ch3mist_twitter> MadLittleMods: I mailed the support and got my issue fixed. Thanks a lot for the prompt response and solving my issue. Should have done this months ago :)
[2018-04-04 02:29:04] <MadLittleMods> 0xa1ch3mist_twitter: No problem 
[2018-04-04 07:28:05] <owlfakes_twitter> Hi "Sign in with github" make desktop app white blank. but "with Twtter" works fine. Where can I issue this?
[2018-04-04 07:28:39] <MadLittleMods> owlfakes_twitter: It is being tracked here [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-04 17:50:39] <TallTed> MadLittleMods: Is there a way to tell these systems that I'm the same user, whether I'm logged in via Twitter or Github, so that if I join a room under one login, it applies to both? and/or if someone tags one handle (@TallTed_twitter, previously used by necessity) I see notifications under the other (@TallTed, used now and preferred)?
[2018-04-04 17:51:22] <MadLittleMods> TallTed: It's not possible to merge accounts yet
[2018-04-04 22:52:53] <TallTed> MadLittleMods: - Tell me there's an admin-ish way to deal with spam.... like   [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-04 22:53:27] <MadLittleMods> TallTed: Admins can delete messages. 
[2018-04-04 22:57:25] <TallTed> MadLittleMods: - Cool.  Enhancement request: explicit "notify admin" (for times when you don't know who's the admin and/or they're not watching channel)
[2018-04-04 23:07:08] <MadLittleMods> TallTed:   I have a PR on the private repo that needs to be ported over at some point, [<-ISSUE->] 
[2018-04-05 02:10:06] <Tanedo> Hi all, I hope this is the right place to ask for troubleshooting. I recently created a gitter room associated with a GitHub repository, call it Unique_Name.  The gitter room is also named Repo_Name. Then I instead wanted to have this Gitter room (Unique_Name) be associated with an organization (with the same name, Unique_Name) instead of the original repository.I tried deleting the Unique_Name gitter room, but now when I try to create a new room for the Unique_Name organization, it won't let me make a room of any name.
[2018-04-05 02:11:40] <Tanedo> Tanedo: Maybe I didn't properly delete the room?
[2018-04-05 02:13:18] <MadLittleMods> Tanedo: Are you confusing communities and rooms (a community consists of many rooms)? Communities can't be deleted so it still exists, try visiting/Unique_Name/home. It would be easier if you shared the actual URLs
[2018-04-05 02:15:56] <Tanedo> MadLittleMods: , Ah, I see. You are absolutely correct.
[2018-04-05 02:17:20] <Tanedo> MadLittleMods: So indeed, the community still exists and has 0 rooms with 0 people, and I'm not even sure if I can access it anymore now that I left the room.
[2018-04-05 02:17:59] <MadLittleMods> Tanedo: If it isn't showing up in the create room modal ("Add a room" button), I create a dummy room you can join. Just pass along the community name
[2018-04-05 02:18:47] <Tanedo> MadLittleMods: I see. Is there a way to pass off "ownership" of the community from my personal GitHub to the Organization?
[2018-04-05 02:20:05] <Tanedo> and/or to associate the community with a the organization?
[2018-04-05 02:20:24] <MadLittleMods> @Tanedo It's really hard to reason about the best way forward without the details. Please send an email with all the links and desired details to support@gitter.imCould we just delete the community and you can re-create it with the correct association?
[2018-04-05 02:20:52] <Tanedo> Yes, that would be great. Thanks,@MadLittleMods. I'll send the e-mail.
[2018-04-05 03:33:25] <gafflatus> Could anyone tell me how to change my nickname of gitter?
[2018-04-05 03:54:30] <MadLittleMods> Lcafebabe: Your username matches whatever you have on GitHub. If you updated your GitHub username, sign out and sign back in to Gitter to have it updated
[2018-04-05 03:57:41] <gafflatus> Ah,,I see,thanks a lot
[2018-04-05 07:28:04] <joeha480> Hello. I just downloaded the windows client and clicked "Sign in with Github" but there's just an empty window. Nothing happens.
[2018-04-05 07:30:20] <gafflatus> Actually I am too.
[2018-04-05 07:31:03] <MadLittleMods> joeha480: @LcafebabeSee [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-05 07:34:51] <joeha480> MadLittleMods: Thanks! It worked.
[2018-04-05 07:36:03] <gafflatus> MadLittleMods: Thanks!
[2018-04-08 09:50:10] <Blaisorblade> I think Gitter UX has an unfortunate behavior prone to abuse by trolls — this message is an example (in fact, it's by@Blaisorblade, but I don't have to say that, and the information is not reliable)
[2018-04-08 09:50:44] <Blaisorblade> Hi! The above message is from me
[2018-04-08 09:50:59] <Blaisorblade> but as you can see, Gitter doesn't show that
[2018-04-08 09:51:17] <Blaisorblade> to reproduce, enter a/memessage, then edit out your username at the start
[2018-04-08 09:52:04] <Blaisorblade> I learned this by accident
[2018-04-08 09:52:26] <Blaisorblade> but other people in the room immediately realized they could exploit this for abuse
[2018-04-08 09:53:37] <Blaisorblade> Unrelatedly, the notifications to the right of this room link to GitHub not GitLab
[2018-04-08 10:03:51] <Blaisorblade> Back to the original, I was searching for issues because searching formetriggers a 500 error in gitlab [<-LINK->] , so I'm afraid I'll be back to bugs in the software I'm supposed to work on. Hope this report helps anyway
[2018-04-08 10:36:43] <pdurbin> Blaisorblade: that reminds me of the "Libelous quote-to-reply" feedback I gave to Discourse: [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-08 11:06:28] <Blaisorblade> pdurbin: see the difference? that one's detectable, this isn't
[2018-04-08 11:07:05] <Blaisorblade> pdurbin: deleting example
[2018-04-08 11:14:36] <pdurbin> Yes, I see the difference.
[2018-04-08 15:38:30] <voltage555> hey, im really having a bad time using gitter right now, it's not really intuitive
[2018-04-08 15:42:42] <voltage555> for example, i was trying to search for communities and favorite them, but it seems like you can't do that, you can only search for rooms in side communities, and it seems like the favorite button for communities doesn't work (but for rooms inside communities it does) - idk if it's a bug or it's on my end, i tried disabling ublock origin and try, still didn't work, idk what else could cause that on my end
[2018-04-08 15:44:31] <voltage555> and it seems like the only way to add a community to the "Your communities" on the menu is by joining a room in the community
[2018-04-08 23:47:22] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @BlaisorbladeThis is tracked by [<-LINK->] . If you are interested in fixing it up, propose a design change in the issue. The relevant code is here for a MR, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-08 23:49:07] <MadLittleMods> Blaisorblade: The GitLab activity issues are tracked by these issuesgitterHQ/services#83
gitterHQ/services#99
[2018-04-08 23:50:22] <Blaisorblade> MadLittleMods: OK, happy that it's at least tracked
[2018-04-08 23:51:12] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @voltage555Staring on the community home is broken, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-08 23:52:51] <pdurbin> Yep, +1 for the issue already being tracked. Thanks,@MadLittleMods
[2018-04-09 12:18:29] <mcarpenterjr> Hey is there a full screen option in gitter? triedF11, no action.
[2018-04-09 14:48:07] <MadLittleMods> mcarpenterjr: F11 fullscreens the browser for any tab. There isn't a shortcut for the desktop app
[2018-04-09 14:49:16] <cbj4074> Unless you're on Windows, in which case it's Windows Key + Up Arrow ;)
[2018-04-09 14:50:58] <MadLittleMods> cbj4074: Maximizing != fullscreen though. It looks like NW.js has some methods to set it up but requires adding the shortcuts yourself
[2018-04-09 14:53:48] <cbj4074> MadLittleMods: Oooh, good call. I mis-read his question. Thanks
[2018-04-09 15:23:31] <mcarpenterjr> Shouldf11work then or does it need to be configured? because I got nothin.
[2018-04-09 16:43:47] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @mcarpenterjrIt won't work atm. I found [<-LINK->] and added some links to the relevant code we need to add (MR welcome)
[2018-04-09 17:17:08] <mcarpenterjr> MadLittleMods: awesome, I'll take a look.
[2018-04-09 17:18:19] <MadLittleMods> mcarpenterjr: heads-up, there is some unreleased work that updated NW.js in this MR which is probably easier to work from, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-10 15:01:02] <muattiyah> On iOS, is there any way I can get all notifications as push and not get email notifications?
[2018-04-10 18:21:11] <tstackhouse> Is there any news about this issue? [<-LINK->] It's a good 2 years old and I'm sick of getting emails for unread messages (so I turned emails off)
[2018-04-10 18:21:42] <tstackhouse> At the very least, is it possible to update this help article to point at the issue on gitlab and not github? [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-10 19:10:51] <MadLittleMods> @tstackhouse Thanks for bringing it up, I updated the articleNo progress but is a big pain point I want to fix. I added a link to the relevant code in the issue description if you want to take a stab,https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/tree/157e8a0bee4ba121bb83c8848e443c93ae6271ff/server/services/unread-items
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/tree/157e8a0bee4ba121bb83c8848e443c93ae6271ff/server/services/unread-items/redis-lua
[2018-04-10 19:11:51] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @muattiyahYou should be getting push notifications. You won't get push notifications if you have a desktop instance open or the [<-LINK->] active though
[2018-04-10 19:14:14] <muattiyah> MadLittleMods: Sometimes I won’t get push notifications but instead get email notifications
[2018-04-10 19:14:32] <muattiyah> I want to disable email notifications and receive only push notifications
[2018-04-10 19:14:39] <muattiyah> I only have the ios client open
[2018-04-10 19:25:55] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
[2018-04-10 19:29:12] <MadLittleMods> muattiyah: You can disable email notifications using the "Unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any notification email or toggling the checkbox in the notification defaults modal, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-10 19:32:02] <muattiyah> I only have the gitter ios app so I don’t know what that whole 3 mobweb thing is about
[2018-04-10 19:32:19] <muattiyah> I got the push notification fo these messages
[2018-04-10 19:32:50] <MadLittleMods> muattiyah: I think the iOS app counts asmobweb(it's just looking formobilein the user agent)
[2018-04-10 19:32:56] <muattiyah> Push works fine, it’s just that sometimes I will get email notifications jnstead of them
[2018-04-10 19:33:26] <muattiyah> The notification defaults modal is in the desktop web app only, right?
[2018-04-10 19:34:51] <MadLittleMods> muattiyah: Perhaps. The "Unsubscribe" link from an email does the same thing and is probably easier for you to access on mobile
[2018-04-10 19:35:17] <muattiyah> MadLittleMods: I see, I just logged in via the browser to do it
[2018-04-10 19:35:54] <muattiyah> MadLittleMods: I am assuming I am going to have to do this for each channel, right? 
[2018-04-10 19:36:24] <muattiyah> nope, worked out just fine
[2018-04-10 19:36:26] <MadLittleMods> muattiyah: Nope, the checkbox applies to all notification emails
[2018-04-10 19:36:34] <muattiyah> Yes, perfect.
[2018-04-10 19:36:44] <muattiyah> MadLittleMods: Thanks for your help :)
[2018-04-10 19:38:20] <MadLittleMods> muattiyah: No problem. I'm not an iOS user so details are bit foggy and I have to use the iOS simulator
[2018-04-10 19:39:24] <muattiyah> ah I see, sorry about the hassle :)
[2018-04-10 23:19:27] <neachdainn> Hopefully this is the correct place to ask. I'm trying to follow the guide posted [<-LINK->] but Weechat isn't producing a SHA-1 fingerprint. Any suggestion on how to proceed?
[2018-04-10 23:35:27] <MadLittleMods> neachdainn: You can try [<-LINK->] . There is also this short guide in the wiki, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-10 23:37:12] <neachdainn> I'll try there. Thanks!
[2018-04-11 15:44:45] <hanct> hi curious, is there any gitter room for asking general android question?
[2018-04-11 15:50:55] <MadLittleMods> hanct: There is a Russian room, [<-LINK->] . There is also a very general developer room, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-11 16:03:20] <hanct> Thanks Eric!!
[2018-04-11 17:11:31] <InternetUnexplorer>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-12 05:34:41] <replaysMike> not sure if this is the right place to ask, but the windows client just shows a white page when I click Sign In. Can't get it to work
[2018-04-12 05:35:19] <replaysMike> google search sent me here ;)
[2018-04-12 05:38:14] <replaysMike> I just found a working solution: [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-12 05:53:14] <chompoo500ml> replaysMike: Does that workaround work for you?
[2018-04-12 05:53:29] <replaysMike> yea it totally did
[2018-04-12 05:53:43] <chompoo500ml> thank you
[2018-04-12 15:27:40] <tstackhouse> MadLittleMods: Thanks for checking that out! If I had the time it could be fun to take a stab at that, but I'll keep my ears open.
[2018-04-13 21:03:03] <MadLittleMods> Heads-up, I'm going to do some maintenance on the production Elasticsearch servers to fix recent messages not showing up in search, [<-LINK->] . This means that search will 500 and not return any results for a little while. If you are curious what I'm up to see, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-13 22:01:38] <MadLittleMods> Search is up again but won't have recent messages yet. I'm waiting for the cluster to be green and will create the new river indexes
[2018-04-14 03:35:47] <cbj4074> 
[2018-04-14 16:34:44] <MadLittleMods> Recent messages should be showing up in search again , [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-15 18:35:00] <badape-net> I was wondering if there was a bug with the windows desktop app and signing in using github, i tried and ended up with a blank app with only gitter - login showing
[2018-04-15 18:35:10] <badape-net> twitter sign in page seems to work
[2018-04-15 19:06:04] <badape-net> oh manually enter a code into the config file, that worked
[2018-04-15 19:22:24] <MadLittleMods> badape-net:  For future onlookers, see [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-15 19:23:44] <badape-net> the link in the topic didn't have anything about it, my hopeless googling skills took a while to find that
[2018-04-15 19:24:44] <MadLittleMods> badape-net: There is [<-LINK->] btw
[2018-04-15 19:24:53] <badape-net> so this is the post irc world, well it looks nicer,
[2018-04-15 19:26:07] <badape-net> weird i did look for another channel
[2018-04-15 19:26:50] <badape-net> so what can gitter do that others can't?
[2018-04-15 19:29:07] <MadLittleMods> badape-net: It's a chat app like any other. People like the markdown and KaTeX support for formatting messages and it's often used for open source GitHub projects. If you prefer IRC, you can use [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-15 19:31:17] <badape-net> MadLittleMods: i don't mind what i use, a fair few of my favourite projects moved from freenode to gitter recently, as i've been on irc since 94 and freenode since 98,
[2018-04-15 19:31:24] <badape-net> oh i just noticed the activity stream
[2018-04-15 19:34:00] <MadLittleMods> badape-net: TheundefinedGitLab events in the activity stream are being tracked by [<-ISSUE->] . Currently working on the production deploy but want to tackle that soon after
[2018-04-15 20:20:53] <badape-net> that is a really good feature
[2018-04-15 20:21:47] <badape-net> i was using gitlab, but i migrated to github because of the cost of gitlfs space
[2018-04-16 20:13:32] <Algorithman> Just a quick question: is there maybe a poll function planned for gitter? or something like a sticky post?
[2018-04-16 20:34:37] <MadLittleMods> Algorithman: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/489
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/501
[2018-04-16 20:36:09] <Algorithman> seems there's not much interest for them :) but thx
[2018-04-17 05:20:00] <YungGlitch> Hi, I just installed Gitter app for windows and after i try to log in with git hub the screen goes white and doesen't load anything, any ideas?
[2018-04-17 05:31:29] <MadLittleMods> YungGlitch: See [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-17 05:39:59] <YungGlitch> MadLittleMods: Thank you, it solved my problem
[2018-04-17 11:25:36] <YungGlitch> how can i block someone?
[2018-04-17 12:22:27] <dupl10> i am new...so i don't know...
[2018-04-17 12:22:57] <jacksonisiah> YungGlitch: that feature doesn't exist yet
[2018-04-17 12:23:04] <dupl10> can you guys understand my poor English?
[2018-04-17 12:23:08] <jacksonisiah> yes
[2018-04-17 12:23:39] <dupl10> yes for who?for me?
[2018-04-17 12:24:52] <YungGlitch> jacksonisiah: ignore?
[2018-04-17 12:25:55] <dupl10> what is the "HQ" meaning  in this group id?

[2018-04-17 12:26:33] <jacksonisiah> YungGlitch: I'm not sure but I don't think so
[2018-04-17 12:26:47] <dupl10> thank  you
[2018-04-17 12:26:53] <jacksonisiah> I asked about that ~1 month ago
[2018-04-17 12:28:35] <dupl10> i must refer a dictionary for really understanding this "headquarters" word...
[2018-04-17 12:29:11] <jacksonisiah> synonyms:    the head office, the main office, HQ, the base, the nerve center, the war room, mission control, the command post
[2018-04-17 12:29:16] <jacksonisiah> that might help.
[2018-04-17 12:30:16] <dupl10> 司令部...i know...
[2018-04-17 12:32:50] <dupl10> jacksonisiah: you are good at English
[2018-04-17 12:33:02] <jacksonisiah> thanks

[2018-04-17 21:03:22] <nrc> How can I report a bug in Gitter?
[2018-04-17 21:05:55] <nrc> The bug is that I cannot add a room and there are a bunch of JS errors appearing in the dev tools console (OS X, Chrome, no extensions)
[2018-04-17 21:11:02] <MadLittleMods> nrc: You can explain it here and paste the JS errors, then create an issue if there isn't already one [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-17 21:15:17] <nrc> STR: click 'add a room' button, enter text in the 'room name' box, on editing I see the errorvendor.js:14 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'get' of undefined. When I click 'create' nothing happens on the web page and I see the following errors in the console:vendor.js:14 Uncaught Error: A group needs to be selected in order to create a room,router-app.js:4 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'get' of undefined. No room is created.
[2018-04-17 21:15:46] <nrc> A cursory search showed no similar issues, but I'm not familiar with the GitLab UI
[2018-04-17 21:18:21] <MadLittleMods> @nrc Can you give some details on the room you are trying to create (community, room, connected to a repo)? Share a screenshot?It seems like community isn't selected. Perhaps it was manually typed but it doesn't actually exist
[2018-04-17 21:35:52] <nrc> MadLittleMods: it's a room connected to a repo - rust-lang (which I have admin access on GitHub, not sure about Gitter permissions), it is auto-populated when I click 'add a room' since I was in a rust-lang room. After checking, rust-lang does not appear in the drop down list, but it definitely exists - there are other rooms and other people can create rooms for that repo
[2018-04-17 21:44:53] <MadLittleMods> @nrc I can see where the confusion comes from. We auto-select the community of the current room but we don't ensure that you can actually admin that community.Here is the relevant code,https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/fb79d582016e923c289d6f09affca175ff97e5fe/public/js/ensured/present-create-room-dialog.js#L31Care to create an issue about ensuring you are a room admin before auto selecting in the create room modal? https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issuesIn terms of why you aren't considered an admin of the community, you can try the tips here, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/faq.md#why-isnt-my-github-organisation-or-repos-appearingWhat is the URL of your community so I can check the security descriptor (it might be set to manual you aren't an admin)?
[2018-04-17 21:46:19] <nrc> MadLittleMods:  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-17 21:47:41] <MadLittleMods> @nrc Anyone who is part of the https://github.com/rust-lang GitHub org should be able to admin https://gitter.im/rust-lang but we might not be able to see you.This is outlined in the FAQ doc I linked but the easiest thing to do is make your org membership public https://github.com/orgs/rust-lang/people?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=nrc. You can also add private repo scope for yourself and the org
[2018-04-17 21:50:43] <nrc> Excellent - that worked, making my ownership public allows me to create rooms, thanks!
[2018-04-17 21:50:57] <nrc> I'll file the issue about populating rooms ...
[2018-04-17 21:54:19] <nrc> Filed [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-17 21:58:05] <MadLittleMods> Thanks @nrc Sorry for the trouble you ran into 
[2018-04-17 21:58:23] <nrc> Thanks for helping!
[2018-04-17 22:26:21] <nrc> Heh, so now I have another problem - how do I create a channel for a repo? If I try to add a room with that name then I'm not allowed, but if I go to the url ( [<-LINK->] ) I get a 404
[2018-04-17 22:26:26] <nrc> It's a public repo
[2018-04-17 22:28:54] <MadLittleMods> @nrc The room needs to be associated with the GitHub repo in order to create something with the same name on GitHub. [<-CODE->] 
[2018-04-17 22:35:33] <MadLittleMods> The fix for this on our side would be to check from both public and private tokens at the same time. There is a PR on the old private repo that needs to be ported over to the public GitLab repo and revived, [<-ISSUE->] , that will add this functionality.
[2018-04-17 22:42:17] <nrc> Hmm, I don't get any auto-complete in the room name box
[2018-04-17 22:42:32] <nrc> I've tried with an without allowing private repo access for me
[2018-04-17 22:42:44] <nrc> which sounded like the thing to try from the FAQ entry
[2018-04-17 22:45:31] <MadLittleMods> @nrc Ensure public repo scope is granted on the org.It should work if you only have public repo scope personally and public repo scope granted on the orgAnd it is a public repo
[2018-04-17 22:47:08] <MadLittleMods> nrc: At the moment, I don't think public repo scope is granted on the org because your GitHub token doesn't return anyrust-langrepos
[2018-04-17 22:47:39] <nrc> Yeah, that seems to be right
[2018-04-17 22:55:09] <nrc> OK, managed to fix that and have created the room!
[2018-04-17 22:55:16] <nrc> Thanks again@MadLittleMods!
[2018-04-17 23:02:33] <MadLittleMods> @nrc I updated the repo conflict message to be more actionable and clear on what to do next, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/merge_requests/1118I also created a fix for the auto-selected community regardless of permissions, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/merge_requests/1117
[2018-04-17 23:05:04] <nrc> Nice 
[2018-04-18 11:19:44] <x8-999-github> Hi! I wonder if gitter can be self -hosted? (I have seen many github repo and some talk about it but .. I don't know the answer)
[2018-04-18 11:24:39] <x8-999-github>  [<-LINK->] looks like the main app ?
[2018-04-18 17:35:24] <MadLittleMods> x8-999-github: You can technically self-host just with the Docker instructions in the readme. There isn't a guide on how to make a more battle hardened production setup though
[2018-04-18 20:54:58] <kngako> Hi, is this the chat room to discuss gitter's UI/UX? As a new user of the chat platform I have a few questions.
[2018-04-18 21:55:50] <MadLittleMods> kngako: Yes, it's for Gitter support which includes reporting issues, discussing potential new features, and any general feedback
[2018-04-18 22:11:16] <kngako> Ayt, I'd like to know if there's a reason to why replies are not threaded. Or does gitter have a different way of allowing users to form/follow a subtopic in a chat room apart from the whole mention/@ of the person you are replying to?
[2018-04-18 22:13:53] <MadLittleMods> @kngako I responded to your tweets but I'll copy that same info here.Threaded conversations is definitely on the list, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/741. As a first step, I want to implement threads like StackExchange chat has where it points to the message you are referencing. Proper siloed threads can come later on. There are some things in between this actually getting implemented by me but feel free to create a merge request if you are up for itOn Gitter, there are permalink pointers  April 18, 2018 5:11 PM which help somewhat but hovering doesn't highlight the message (you have to click through). You can click the timestamp in the top-right of every message and copy from the address bar or alt-click to get the markdown snippet in the chat area.
[2018-04-18 22:14:11] <kngako> And also is there a reason why my client (Android, web, Linux desktop) sometimes renders message text and after a short delay renders the styles of the message entities (user handles, issues, and the likes)? Surely the message entities are known before initial rendering?
[2018-04-18 22:15:25] <kngako> Another thing I noticed is the email
[2018-04-18 22:16:58] <kngako> Nice, I just discovered the pointer. Clicked on it from my Android client and it opened the browser instead of scrolling to the message. But I get what it should.
[2018-04-18 22:19:55] <MadLittleMods> @kngako  April 18, 2018 5:14 PM Mentions and issue decorations happen client-side, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/tree/715f47451b2541281c9e056df4dc14c9852a60fe/public/js/views/chat/decoratorsFor example with issues, we can't bake in the info for everyone because one user may have access while another may not. Pre-fetching server-side with your token could work and was probably done client-side for simplicity and to defer the potential load time delay from waiting for all the request so you can see the message faster. Plus there might be some scaling issues
[2018-04-18 22:20:39] <MadLittleMods> kngako:  [<-LINK->] What about email?
[2018-04-18 22:22:12] <kngako> Oh the client side decor makes sense. Complex hurdle to handle.
[2018-04-18 22:22:20] <MadLittleMods> kngako: You can track this issue for better permalink pointer support in the apps, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-18 22:25:47] <kngako> With the unread messages email reminder I always found the featured to be very uneventful. A part from being a nice reminder of a chat room I once joined I wouldn't see messages worth seeing in the email. But I guess since theirs no upvote or down vote feature. Picking unread messages to add to the email reminder is a random function?
[2018-04-18 22:29:19] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] Currently, the messages in the notification email should be the most recent unreads when it was sent.I really like how Twitter sends a digest every day of interesting tweets and it would be great if Gitter had something similar. This might be easier once we add a like/reaction system to messages https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/365. At the moment we could infer interest by how many people read the message or message activity/frequency around that time
[2018-04-18 22:29:58] <MadLittleMods> You can track [<-LINK->] for a better email digest
[2018-04-18 22:33:34] <kngako> Since you say you are planning on adding more PWA features to Gitter is it safe to assume that the rest API allows one to carry out all the actions one would find on the official apps by implementing a smaller client?
[2018-04-18 22:35:01] <MadLittleMods> @kngako Most of the actions are in the public API. Some things are in the private API but still accessible if you want to dig into the details yourself. We are willing to move to the public API if need be (MR welcome)We list 3rd party apps here, https://gitter.im/apps. There is also some 3rd party API wrappers here, https://developer.gitter.im/docs/third-party-api-wrappers
[2018-04-18 22:42:01] <kngako> Great! I think I might play around with API and see what I can create. Thanks for talking me through the things.
[2018-04-18 22:42:36] <MadLittleMods> kngako: You're welcome. There is [<-LINK->] if you want to discuss with others who have touched the API
[2018-04-18 22:50:32] <kngako> 
[2018-04-20 04:58:23] <huahuayu> Hi, I think there's official support in this group, I'd like to report an issue: when you share a gist link in gitter, it will expend automatic, and hide your input box, no way to get it off, does anyone can solve this
[2018-04-20 04:58:53] <MadLittleMods> huahuayu: See [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-20 05:00:32] <huahuayu> it’s opend 6 month ago but no fix?
[2018-04-20 05:01:00] <MadLittleMods> @huahuayu Workaround is here https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/desktop/issues/211#note_41487372If you are signing in with GitHub there is another bug, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/desktop/issues/231
[2018-04-20 05:06:12] <huahuayu> how about just don't expend the link
[2018-04-20 05:07:49] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] Not expanding gists in the future is on the list (MR welcome), https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/1399
[2018-04-20 05:40:17] <huahuayu> MadLittleMods: I don’t know how to run /collapse-all, where is it
[2018-04-20 05:40:36] <MadLittleMods> huahuayu: Type it in the chat area and send the message
[2018-04-20 05:41:27] <huahuayu> I need do it once not every group right?
[2018-04-20 05:41:45] <MadLittleMods> huahuayu: You need to do it every time someone posts a gist
[2018-04-20 05:43:38] <huahuayu> ok, a litter inhuman but works
[2018-04-20 05:44:42] <huahuayu> thanks@MadLittleMods, warmhearted
[2018-04-20 05:46:56] <huahuayu> followed you
[2018-04-20 19:03:49] <ljtill> Is there a way to change the zoom level of the Gitter Desktop client (Windows 10)?
[2018-04-20 21:08:50] <MadLittleMods> ljt91: See [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-21 03:58:12] <tstager> Gitter desktop client login with GitHub produces a blank white screen any fix for this?
[2018-04-21 04:01:16] <tstager> I just found the work around. Thanks anyway guys. Sorry for wasting your time.
[2018-04-21 06:58:18] <MadLittleMods> tstager: Workaround here for future onlookers, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-21 09:15:46] <nikitavoloboev> Hi all
[2018-04-21 09:15:58] <nikitavoloboev> I m trying to create a room for an org
[2018-04-21 09:16:02] <nikitavoloboev>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-21 09:16:10] <nikitavoloboev> However Gitter doesn't allow me to do that
[2018-04-21 09:16:47] <nikitavoloboev> I believe the reason is that we once made a Gitter room under [<-LINK->] and removed it after a while
[2018-04-21 09:16:51] <nikitavoloboev> But now we want to make it again
[2018-04-21 09:17:04] <nikitavoloboev> The URL is not taken by anyone but Gitter still doesn't allow us to create the room
[2018-04-21 09:19:15] <nikitavoloboev> And when I press CREATE button here
[2018-04-21 09:19:16] <nikitavoloboev>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-21 09:19:19] <nikitavoloboev> It does nothing
[2018-04-21 16:46:44] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] The links from the "Your organisations" section of the conversation list do nothing and should be removed, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/1617#note_38209051
[2018-04-21 16:49:20] <MadLittleMods> nikitavoloboev:  [<-LINK->] still exists though and I recreated the lobby room, [<-LINK->] , that you can join and create your actually desired rooms with the create room flow "Add a room" button at the bottom of the conversation list
[2018-04-22 13:13:43] <kpion> Hi, can someone @ mention me please?  I just want to see if I'll get notification :)  And sorry if this channel isn't for this kind of tests. BTW, is there a 'test' channel or something? I can see "gitter-integrations-tests" but I doubt this is it?
[2018-04-22 13:15:17] <CodingCreate101> Lol. Anyway. Go away and I ll mention ya.
[2018-04-22 13:15:40] <CodingCreate101> konradpapala: mentioned.
[2018-04-22 13:16:39] <kpion> CodingCreate101: - yeah, it worked, thank you!
[2018-04-22 13:17:08] <CodingCreate101> Lol. You are welcome. Have good time.
[2018-04-22 13:18:48] <kpion> You too :)
[2018-04-22 16:40:17] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @konradpapalaThere is [<-LINK->] or you could use your own room and delete it afterwards
[2018-04-22 17:19:18] <kpion> MadLittleMods: - Thanks !
[2018-04-22 18:09:57] <yeastor_twitter> Where is Activity section on mobile version and app?
[2018-04-22 18:11:00] <ljtill> MadLittleMods: thank you for the link!
[2018-04-22 18:26:22] <christomoore> Hello, any mod around ? I have created  support request, any chance it could be speeded up ?
[2018-04-23 02:34:39] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @yeastor_twitterThe activity stream isn't visible in the mobile apps, you can track [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-23 02:35:14] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @christomooreI'll tackle all of the support tickets on Monday. I don't see one particularly tied to you by name at least
[2018-04-23 12:39:23] <mcarpenterjr> So when my windows app opened this morning it looked like I had a direct mention in the express room but it was really what looked like a block of mentions/messgaes from the nodejs/possibly other rooms. In addition there was an all mention in the angular-cli room that i was alerted to. I was not a memeber of either room at the time. Not sure if this is a bug/glitch or intended?
[2018-04-23 12:43:12] <oliverfoster>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-23 12:43:17] <oliverfoster> I've had this all morning ^
[2018-04-23 13:10:18] <oliverfoster> signing in with github
[2018-04-23 13:10:23] <oliverfoster> twitter sign-in seems to be fine
[2018-04-23 13:15:29] <ghost~580a566dd73408ce4f2fe189> 
[2018-04-23 13:16:15] <oliverfoster> yup, very bazaar
[2018-04-23 13:20:42] <TallTed> oliverfoster:  [<-LINK->] It's very popular.  There is a workaround, on that page.
[2018-04-23 13:21:12] <oliverfoster> stupendous, thanks dude
[2018-04-23 15:28:10] <christomoore> MadLittleMods: Thank you for getting back to me, i will direct message you the email address tied to the support ticket.
[2018-04-23 15:44:31] <oliverfoster>   worked perfectly@TallTed
[2018-04-24 14:27:54] <ewels> Hi! Apologies if this is documented somewhere and I've missed it, but can I archive a a room? eg. Close it without deleting it..
[2018-04-24 14:29:48] <MadLittleMods> ewels: It's not possible at the moment, related issue here [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-24 14:30:32] <ewels> ok cool, thanks 
[2018-04-25 13:53:04] <mittalyashu77_twitter> How can I re-connect gitter with my twitter account?
[2018-04-25 15:09:07] <MadLittleMods> mittalyashu77_twitter: If you mean update your Gitter account with the latest info from Twitter, normally you can do this by signing out and signing back in to Gitter but there is this bug, [<-LINK->] . Send an email tosupport@gitter.imwith links and details and we can manually update your info
[2018-04-25 18:20:54] <nolash> Is there a way to silence automated github messages (pull request sync etc) in the gitter irc?
[2018-04-25 19:14:44] <MadLittleMods> nolash: No, see [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-25 19:25:05] <nolash> MadLittleMods: ty
[2018-04-25 19:54:31] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] You can view a list of the changes here, CHANGELOG.md. New accurate smiling emoji :slight_smile: for exampleWe'll finish off the release and deploy to production (everyone) in the coming days, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/merge_requests/1128
[2018-04-26 12:44:42] <cbj4074> 
[2018-04-26 17:24:58] <stavlor> nice 
[2018-04-27 11:50:09] <mittalyashu77_twitter> MadLittleMods: okay, thanks.
[2018-04-27 13:12:08] <OlegDokuka> Hey there.
[2018-04-27 13:12:37] <OlegDokuka> Got an issue with streaming API
[2018-04-27 13:14:14] <OlegDokuka> it seems that messages simply do not come to the client. Did you make any changes regarding current streaming API or that is a known issue for now?
[2018-04-27 13:17:25] <Shatha-Alhamad> Hi all please guide me to angular/protractor group
[2018-04-27 13:17:35] <Shatha-Alhamad> Thanks in advance
[2018-04-27 15:50:50] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @OlegDokukaWhat account are you using with the API? It's possible it got caught in our spam detection
[2018-04-27 15:52:04] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @Shatha-AlhamadYou can use the search in the top-left (look for a magnifying glass) and type in the name of the room you are after. Simply googling "angular/protractor gitter" also got me there, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-27 16:05:32] <OlegDokuka> Hi@MadLittleMods. Yeah, it might be and right, I'm using this account. I'm public speaker and demoing reactive programming techniques on the example of  communication with gitter. Hence, there is high probability that my account caught in spam list since there is retry mechanism in my application which may reconnect in case of error once per 200 ms. Nevertheless, api.gitter.im is accessible regardless potential ban of my acc for stream.gitter.im. In the case if my account got to black list I would kindly ask to, potentially, whitelist me
[2018-04-27 16:09:03] <OlegDokuka> It is very important for me, since I'm planing to give a talk on the 5th of May at Java Day.Istanbul and it would be amazing if my demo will go smoothly
[2018-04-27 17:15:24] <MadLittleMods> OlegDokuka: OlegDokukalooks to be fine and would be if you can still send messages here. I'm not sure what your code looks like but the streaming API is only for listening and you send messages via this endpoint [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-27 17:24:42] <OlegDokuka> Am,  yeah I supposed that something wrong in my code but then I tried examples from official docs and found that plain curl simply does not work
[2018-04-27 17:34:31] <OlegDokuka>  [<-CODE->] 
[2018-04-27 17:34:47] <OlegDokuka> and then write some messages here
[2018-04-27 17:34:48] <OlegDokuka> so if you try
[2018-04-27 17:35:10] <OlegDokuka> you will observe nothing in the terminal I guess
[2018-04-27 19:42:02] <omerasif57> feature request: dark mode for android app.
[2018-04-27 20:04:45] <MadLittleMods> omerasif57: See [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-27 20:20:15] <omerasif57> posted an year ago.
[2018-04-27 20:22:40] <cbj4074> You must be new here...
[2018-04-27 20:26:44] <omerasif57> very new.
[2018-04-27 20:27:36] <omerasif57> was searching for evernote dark theme for windows
[2018-04-27 20:28:27] <omerasif57> came to know about Tusk evernote client. tusk send me here. gitter.
[2018-04-27 20:29:20] <omerasif57> and no dark theme again.
[2018-04-27 20:30:00] <MadLittleMods> cbj4074:  
[2018-04-27 20:36:03] <cbj4074> LOL :D
[2018-04-27 20:38:24] <cbj4074> @omerasif57 The best course of action is to Thumbs-Up the issue to which @MadLittleMods linked on GitLab, so it gains more attention.Gitter changed ownership in the past year, and code was not shipped for a while. The pipeline is open again, so up-voting issues is probably the best way to voice your request.
[2018-04-27 20:53:11] <omerasif57> okay
[2018-04-28 07:44:06] <darkdev4k> anyone else having an issue when trying to sign up with gitter from the windows client
[2018-04-28 15:39:26] <pdurbin> Hi! I was thrilled to read that Gitter is open source these days. Does that include the mobile apps?
[2018-04-28 16:45:07] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @darkdev4kSee [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-28 16:46:53] <MadLittleMods>  April 28, 2018 10:39 AM @pdurbin Ideally yes but not currently. Only the webapp, desktop app, and various libraries are open source at the moment.We will continue moving projects over to GitLab and making them open source though
[2018-04-28 18:51:45] <umputun> looks like some internal version was released by accident? A lot of errors with access tohttp://beta-internal:8080/job
[2018-04-28 20:28:06] <MadLittleMods> umputun: Where are you seeing it? It can probably be ignored
[2018-04-28 21:17:40] <MadLittleMods> ^ It's just trying to grab source maps that you don't have access to. They are safe to ignoreWarning from Firefox as an example [<-CODE->] 
[2018-04-29 13:22:08] <george-antohi78> Hi all
[2018-04-29 13:22:41] <george-antohi78> Using Gitter app for dekstop windows 10. I can;t see the GitHUB login screen. Any one else with this problem?
[2018-04-29 16:09:05] <N8Solutions> can anyone tell me if it's possible to block a person from gitter chat?
[2018-04-29 16:10:07] <N8Solutions> I've blocked said individual via settings in Github but I still see them in gitter chat. Is that normal?
[2018-04-29 16:31:46] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @george-antohi78See [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-29 16:32:25] <MadLittleMods>  April 29, 2018 11:09 AM @N8Solutions There isn't  a way to block someone, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/370If someone is harassing you, please send an email to support@gitter.im with the details
[2018-04-29 16:33:52] <N8Solutions> MadLittleMods: thank you
[2018-04-29 16:34:09] <N8Solutions> not harassing, just annoying
[2018-04-29 16:34:25] <N8Solutions> and rude
[2018-04-29 16:40:37] <MadLittleMods> N8Solutions: If it is in a normal room (not a one to one) you can ban them/ban @user
[2018-04-29 16:41:03] <N8Solutions> I don't run the room though
[2018-04-29 16:41:12] <N8Solutions> MadLittleMods: 
[2018-04-29 16:41:18] <N8Solutions> I'm  just a visitor in that room
[2018-04-29 16:41:44] <MadLittleMods> N8Solutions: There isn't a solution there ( [<-LINK->] ). If you can get the admin's attention, perhaps they would agree
[2018-04-29 16:42:14] <N8Solutions> OK, thank you for your time
[2018-04-29 20:30:14] <pdurbin> MadLittleMods: good to know that you plan to open source the mobile apps as well. Thanks!
[2018-04-30 08:54:20] <george-antohi78> Using Gitter app for dekstop windows 10. I can;t see the GitHUB login screen. Any one else with this problem?
[2018-04-30 08:54:29] <george-antohi78> Any one?!
[2018-04-30 08:55:26] <OptikWebCreative> george-antohi78: how do you mean you can't see the GitHub login screen, can you provide a little more info & also context
[2018-04-30 08:56:03] <george-antohi78> OptikWebCreative: On th elogin screen you have two option: GitHUB or Twitter. I selected GitHUB, the screen is empty
[2018-04-30 08:57:14] <OptikWebCreative> so the modal popup window appears, but its empty
[2018-04-30 08:57:35] <OptikWebCreative> sadly I use the app on Mac, but it was working when I logged in yesterday
[2018-04-30 08:57:44] <OptikWebCreative> will log out, and try again
[2018-04-30 08:57:48] <george-antohi78> OptikWebCreative: Indeed. The Twitter one works, but I need GitHUB, and that one is empty.
[2018-04-30 08:58:26] <george-antohi78> OptikWebCreative: yeahm sadly I have to use Windows 10...
[2018-04-30 08:59:59] <OptikWebCreative> its working for me, when did you download the app?
[2018-04-30 09:00:20] <george-antohi78> OptikWebCreative: Two days ago :D
[2018-04-30 09:00:55] <OptikWebCreative> ok, well that rules out an old code base or api conflict
[2018-04-30 09:01:09] <OptikWebCreative> could you try uninstalling the app
[2018-04-30 09:01:20] <OptikWebCreative> deleting the downloaded file
[2018-04-30 09:02:09] <OptikWebCreative> and re-downloading it from [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-30 09:02:28] <OptikWebCreative> then try re-installing it, just incase something failed
[2018-04-30 09:05:09] <george-antohi78> OptikWebCreative: Sure thing, i can rtry
[2018-04-30 09:05:36] <OptikWebCreative> if that doesn't help im afraid I don't have anything else :(
[2018-04-30 09:16:10] <george-antohi78> OptikWebCreative: right...not working :(
[2018-04-30 09:17:04] <george-antohi78> OptikWebCreative: as per freaking usually, all bugs on Windows...
[2018-04-30 09:17:21] <OptikWebCreative> hmm, do you have the GitHub client? - just wondering if you can get a connection to GH from any desktop app
[2018-04-30 09:17:25] <george-antohi78> OptikWebCreative: anywy, much appreciated man
[2018-04-30 09:18:18] <george-antohi78> OptikWebCreative: ofcourse GitHUB works and git clients, using Git Bash every day as development goes on, but the app Gitter provided with Git integration is not working...
[2018-04-30 09:18:58] <OptikWebCreative> not sure if you can login with GH on either Glip or Slack but it might be worth trying those ideas too or some other app that allows you to use GH as a login
[2018-04-30 09:19:47] <george-antohi78> OptikWebCreative: I have others and works just fine.
[2018-04-30 09:20:00] <OptikWebCreative> try to isolate the issue to being either the gitter app, or if its an api call issue at GitHub's end
[2018-04-30 09:21:14] <george-antohi78> OptikWebCreative: I will try to look into it as soon as I have a bit time to spare...
[2018-04-30 09:21:14] <OptikWebCreative> if you can isolate it, perhaps on the Gitter GitHub channel create an issue
[2018-04-30 09:22:48] <george-antohi78> OptikWebCreative:  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-30 09:23:13] <george-antohi78> OptikWebCreative: so it;s already known bug and reported one week ago. Some one will fix it I think :) - thanks again man.
[2018-04-30 09:24:03] <OptikWebCreative> there is a workaround on that page which should work for you
[2018-04-30 09:25:51] <george-antohi78> OptikWebCreative: I already red about it and will try later on today and see if it fixes my issue. :D
[2018-04-30 10:44:56] <mahdiraddadi> hello
[2018-04-30 10:46:03] <mahdiraddadi> is there a Gitter desktop application available for Fedora ?
[2018-04-30 15:03:32] <MadLittleMods> george-antohi78: I replied to you above already,  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-04-30 15:06:04] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @mahdiraddadiYou can run the desktop app from source, [<-LINK->] . There is also a neglected MR to build rpm packages, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-05-01 17:09:25] <dylangerdaly> Anyone know if the Backend to Gitter is open source as well?
[2018-05-01 17:09:37] <dylangerdaly> I.E Ability to spin up a Silo Private Instance of Gitter
[2018-05-01 17:54:48] <mcarpenterjr> That would be sweet.
[2018-05-01 17:55:11] <mcarpenterjr> I will say, gitter feels much snappier now...
[2018-05-01 18:17:47] <MadLittleMods>  May 1, 2018 12:09 PM @dylangerdaly The backend and frontend are in the webapp repo, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webappInstructions for setting up your own dockerized dev instance are in the README

[2018-05-01 18:44:44] <dylangerdaly> :O Wow thanks heaps
[2018-05-01 21:19:42] <dylangerdaly> Anyone know if Gitter does any E2E?
[2018-05-01 21:19:48] <dylangerdaly> Encryption at Rest?
[2018-05-01 21:21:35] <MadLittleMods> dylangerdaly: There isn't any encryption on messages
[2018-05-01 21:21:59] <dylangerdaly> Aw man, that would make this so perfect
[2018-05-01 22:58:43] <ghost~59d9ee50d73408ce4f7916bf> How do I leave gitter and remove my account of gitter?????

[2018-05-02 06:34:57] <renatomarinho> 
[2018-05-02 15:39:31] <nikomatsakis> A lot of people have been reporting problems around messages not showing up lately in the rust-lang rooms — I also see it, only sometimes.
[2018-05-02 15:39:44] <nikomatsakis> Usually you have to click on the "unread messages" indicator to see the missing messages
[2018-05-02 15:40:04] <nikomatsakis> though sometimes messages fromsomepeople show up but not others (which can be quite confusing, if one of the missing people is talking to one of the not missing people)
[2018-05-02 15:40:11] <nikomatsakis> I can't see to find an issue on this, should I try to file one?
[2018-05-02 15:40:16] <nikomatsakis> it's hard to "reproduce" reliably
[2018-05-02 17:47:40] <MadLittleMods> @nikomatsakis Yes please, I have noticed this a few times (@sunjay has also mentioned it)Have you noticed it as much today? The infrastructure is in a better place now after yesterdays down time but we should better handle this case regardless
[2018-05-02 17:47:57] <nikomatsakis> MadLittleMods: still happening today definitely
[2018-05-02 17:48:06] <nikomatsakis> not so much to me, as by others
[2018-05-02 17:48:08] <nikomatsakis> though I did have it some
[2018-05-02 17:48:43] <nikomatsakis> unrelated,  but I also filed: [<-LINK->] 
[2018-05-02 17:48:53] <nikomatsakis> since it took me a long while to figure out how to join this room in the first place :P
[2018-05-02 17:49:43] <MadLittleMods> Nothing has changed application code wise in production in a long time but messages not showing up until clicking the unread indicator has been happening more lately [<-CODE->] 
[2018-05-02 17:50:46] <nikomatsakis> filed [<-LINK->] 
[2018-05-02 17:51:04] <nikomatsakis> it looks like I have that off
[2018-05-02 17:51:17] <nikomatsakis> though I'm not sure if that is reflecting the status of the app
[2018-05-02 17:51:30] <nikomatsakis> (vs the browser)
[2018-05-02 17:52:10] <MadLittleMods> Thenexttoggle is stored locally (per-client) but the features below are cross-platform (stored in the db)

[2018-05-04 13:57:56] <Razva> is there any way to import emails into Gitter?
[2018-05-04 13:58:28] <Razva> I'm looking into unifying my email notifications for servers/services
[2018-05-04 16:18:55] <MadLittleMods> Razva: You can invite people to your room by email. Press "Add" button underneath the roster on the right or the "Add people to this room" option in the room settings dropdown, then just enter the email in the input. There isn't a way to bulk add but you could automate it with some JS in the devtools console
[2018-05-05 13:33:05] <skygate2012> Are non-programming related chatrooms allowed on Gitter?
[2018-05-05 15:27:18] <harysim> Hi, i am trying to retrieve all chat messages of a specific Gitter room, I used postman app, and I was able to get something, however it seems that I am not getting all the messages, only around 52 messages. Is there a way to get a full archive of messages of a specific Gitter room? thanks
[2018-05-05 16:26:35] <root-ansh> hi there, i am completely new to gitter and i don't seem to understand how to use it.1) I have seen people adding a link to their github chat on their main profile. how to make one? and  would that chatroom mean that "this chatroom is a public one- to many  chatroom for all those who need to talk to me. and i am the admin."?2)some repositories also have a chatroom set for them only. how to make one? and would that chatoom mean : " an faq chat for all the q/a related to this repository/library " ?How can we find more such rooms?3) just before entering this chatoom, i was asked to read the 'topic' so as to not ask already answered  questions. But where is this 'topic' section?4)can someone please point me to  some tutorials and detailed documentation of it?I just want to learn about this amazing  software. Hope am not posting this message at  a wrong place
[2018-05-05 16:46:16] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @skygate2012You can create a Gitter room for whatever topic you want
[2018-05-05 16:47:40] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @harysimYes, but you have to [<-CODE->] . Here is an example that you will need to modify to get exactly what you want, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-05-05 16:56:24] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @chaostools [<-CODE->] 
[2018-05-05 23:44:56] <harysim> MadLittleMods: Thank you for your help, I managed to retreive older messages by beforeId parameter, However I am retreiving thousands of message, how many messages are allowed to retrive each time? I tried rest Api [<-LINK->] but i only get 52, then I used the beforeId parameter and I had to use the limit option, What I am trying to ask, is that anyway where I retrieve thousands of messages at once or the only option is to go with 50 or 100. thanks again
[2018-05-06 00:32:39] <ersin-ertan> I have not seen a topic about this issue, please include a way to change the font size. I'm using a 4k monitor, Ubuntu system(200% zoom), and for whatever reason the font size in gitter is so small.
[2018-05-06 01:22:33] <InternetUnexplorer> @harysim Looks like you can only get 100 at a time: [<-CODE->] 
[2018-05-06 13:32:00] <harysim> Thanks
[2018-05-06 13:53:24] <chrsengel> Is it possible to set global notification settings in the android app?

[2018-05-07 01:39:17] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @chrsengelFrom some quick digging, I don't think it is possible to adjust the global defaults in the Android app
[2018-05-08 02:04:51] <LWSS> yo are you related to clint eastwood
[2018-05-08 02:05:11] <LWSS> MadLittleMods: 
[2018-05-08 07:54:33] <MadLittleMods> LWSS:  [<-LINK->]  .... nope
[2018-05-08 12:41:05] <CHN2018> Dear all. may i kindly ask that when i start normalization on the website of metaX, why it always show "Disconnected from the server." I am sure my network is OK.  Thank you !
[2018-05-08 13:48:02] <LDaVinciF_twitter> guys, i'm really know on gitter, and I'm comming here for a question that is also a feed back, ok?1st - love the tools, didn't knew about its existense =) really like, thank you all :]2st - I love dark themes, but the gitter's dark theme isn't cool =/ it's not easy to ready... I don't know why, I'm not a  designer, but my shot is that it needs to have darker background colors. Thankfully that light theme is very nice.
[2018-05-08 13:51:18] <LDaVinciF_twitter> now the questions:I logged with my twitter, which is very old, I'd like to change my profile photo... coun't find where; I'd like to update my info... coun't find where; I'd like to give acess to my github account... coun't find where.u see? All thing related to setting arend ease to find (I don't even know if it's possible to change that)
[2018-05-08 13:54:52] <teivah_twitter> how do I change my username?
[2018-05-08 14:38:28] <cbj4074> LDaVinciF_twitter: Your avatar is pulled directly from Twitter, so you'd need to change it there. Which other info would you like to update (you didn't specify)? Re: GitHub, you would simply login with your GitHub account (but that will create a second, separate username for you, which while annoying, I don't believe to have any "side-effects")
[2018-05-08 14:39:10] <cbj4074> teivah_twitter: You can't; it's tied to your Twitter (or GitHub) account.
[2018-05-08 17:11:41] <MadLittleMods>  May 8, 2018 8:48 AM @LDaVinciF_twitter @cbj4074 Normally, Twitter/GitLab info is updated when you sign out and sign back in to Gitter but there is currently this bug https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/1834 which stops it from happeningSend an email to support@gitter.im with your username and I can manually update it
[2018-05-08 20:26:18] <LWSS> yo are you guys ever going to fix the size of the youtube previews
[2018-05-08 20:27:35] <MadLittleMods> LWSS: The current plan is to stop embedding YouTube and GitHub gists. Merge request welcome (look for iframely), [<-LINK->] 
[2018-05-08 20:28:10] <LWSS> is gitter actually open source now
[2018-05-08 20:28:26] <LWSS> huh
[2018-05-08 20:29:05] <MadLittleMods> LWSS: The webapp and many other libraries are open source. We are still working towards getting other projects open source like the mobile apps
[2018-05-08 20:30:28] <LWSS> it's a nice platform
[2018-05-08 20:31:18] <LWSS> apps like discord have been hunting down and banning what they see as unsavory
[2018-05-08 20:31:37] <LWSS> ex: cheating in video games
[2018-05-08 20:32:09] <LWSS> not to mention it's a botnet but everyone uses it
[2018-05-09 16:04:32] <MadLittleMods> Gitter 19.0.0 has been pushed into production  Some highlights: [<-CODE->] 
[2018-05-09 16:35:03] <cbj4074> MadLittleMods: Looking good in the browser, but seeing lots of issues in the Desktop client (Windows, in this case). I don't see a newer version of the client (it's still3.1.0). Is there some specific user action required in the Desktop client to clear asset caches or similar?
[2018-05-09 16:36:00] <cbj4074> That said, I do see a vertical scrollbar for some messages in the browser, which I don't recall seeing before.
[2018-05-09 16:36:26] <cbj4074>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-05-09 16:36:49] <MadLittleMods> cbj4074: Link to that message?
[2018-05-09 16:37:02] <cbj4074> It's the one just above,   [<-LINK->] 
[2018-05-09 16:37:55] <MadLittleMods> cbj4074: Thanks for the heads-up, I'm open the desktop client now
[2018-05-09 16:38:27] <cbj4074> MadLittleMods: No problem. Also, even in the browser (latest Chrome), the viewport is not scrolling-down automatically when a new message comes in.
[2018-05-09 16:38:42] <cbj4074> I see the mention badge, but not the message, until I click the mention badge.
[2018-05-09 16:39:36] <MadLittleMods> @cbj4074 hmm, this seems to only happen with mentions. I fixed the case for normal messages yesterday, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/merge_requests/1146I'll make a hotfix
[2018-05-09 16:41:08] <MadLittleMods> @cbj4074 I'm not seeing the scrollbar in the desktop client btw, https://i.imgur.com/Sp3j393.pngDo you still see it after a restart of the app (bad cache)?
[2018-05-09 16:53:14] <MadLittleMods> cbj4074: I do see other problems in the desktop app though. Some NPE error aroundObject.assignbut we use it throughout the codebase already 
[2018-05-09 16:53:21] <cbj4074> MadLittleMods: Okay, good deal re: mentions. I do see the veritcal scrollbar in the Desktop client, too.
[2018-05-09 16:54:31] <cbj4074> (and yes, it persists even after restarting the desktop client)
[2018-05-09 16:55:27] <cbj4074> With regard to other, more significant problems in the Desktop client, new messages don't come in at all, until I switch rooms.
[2018-05-09 16:56:43] <cbj4074> And when I switch rooms, the whole viewport goes white for a split-second, and the room selection is not retain (highlighted) in the lefthand pane. Whenever this happens, the console shows:Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a functionrouter-chat.js:1 n.exportsrouter-chat.js:1 (anonymous function)vendor.js:1 lrouter-chat.js:1 (anonymous function)vendor.js:1 lvendor.js:1 window.webpackJsonprouter-chat.js:1 (anonymous function)
[2018-05-09 16:57:15] <cbj4074> (sorry, the formatting is bad, whether with backticks or quote operator)
[2018-05-09 16:57:32] <cbj4074> Going to take lunch, happy to help you troubleshoot when I'm back.
[2018-05-09 16:59:17] <MadLittleMods> cbj4074: I created [<-LINK->] to track the mentions issue and [<-LINK->] for the desktop issue
[2018-05-09 17:05:32] <cbj4074> MadLittleMods: 
[2018-05-09 17:21:03] <RoyalBN> Hello everyone ! I just installed Gitter App on my Xubuntu 16.04 and when opening it and clicking on "Sign in to start talking" nothing happens, it just refresh the animation. I downloaded and installed the .deb for Linux 64-bit
[2018-05-09 17:22:47] <MadLittleMods> RoyalBN: You are running into [<-LINK->] but also we are having a specific outage in the desktop app right now, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-05-09 17:25:02] <RoyalBN> MadLittleMods: Hi ! For me, it's not leading to a blank page it's just staying at the same place.
[2018-05-09 17:25:41] <MadLittleMods> RoyalBN: Then more specifically [<-LINK->] at the moment. I am working on a hotfix now
[2018-05-09 17:25:52] <RoyalBN> maybe I should uninstall it ?
[2018-05-09 17:26:17] <MadLittleMods> RoyalBN: Re-installing won't help the issues I mentioned
[2018-05-09 17:28:17] <RoyalBN> MadLittleMods: Yeah but I meant uninstall and wait until it's fixed ?
[2018-05-09 17:28:43] <MadLittleMods> RoyalBN: Either way is fine 
[2018-05-09 17:29:27] <RoyalBN> Another weird thing is that today I've also install Gitter App for my desktop at school on Ubuntu 16.04 and it was working perfectly...
[2018-05-09 17:40:47] <RoyalBN> MadLittleMods: While removing it, it left installed all the configuration files, should I remove them with--purge? Because dpkg is giving me a warning.
[2018-05-09 17:42:02] <MadLittleMods> RoyalBN: I'm not sure
[2018-05-09 17:42:30] <MadLittleMods> Fix for the desktop app JavaScript is here, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/merge_requests/1149cc @cbj4074
[2018-05-09 17:44:38] <RoyalBN> MadLittleMods: ok so I can leave them there and try reinstall that later
[2018-05-09 19:12:59] <MadLittleMods> @cbj4074 @RoyalBN Desktop app should be in working order again. Hotfix 19.0.1 has been pushed to production@cbj4074 I can see the scroll bar problem you mentioned only in the dark theme and it happens in the webapp as well.  Feel free to create an issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp and submit a merge request if you are feeling up for it
[2018-05-09 19:40:00] <cbj4074> MadLittleMods: Bingo, basic functionality does appear to be restored
[2018-05-09 19:40:23] <cbj4074> Good call on the Dark theme, that sounds plausible, and I'll create an issue in a few min
[2018-05-09 23:56:52] <MadLittleMods> Hotfix 19.0.2 has been pushed to production. This fixes the issue with new messages with mentions not automatically showing up in the chat message listcc @cbj4074 Thanks for reports today 
[2018-05-10 11:12:02] <LDaVinciF_twitter> cbj4074: , thanks for the attetion man, but I already changed my perfil photo there -in twitter- and it did not update here =/
[2018-05-10 11:12:43] <LDaVinciF_twitter> this lack possibilites to change your own perfil is a bit annoying .-.
[2018-05-10 11:50:44] <LDaVinciF_twitter> is there how to delete this acoount?
[2018-05-10 12:39:47] <cbj4074> MadLittleMods: No problem, it's great to see the production pipeline flowing again 
[2018-05-10 12:39:58] <cbj4074> I do still need to open the one for the dark theme, I'll do that now, before I get distracted with work
[2018-05-10 12:40:21] <cbj4074> I notice too that:)isn't converted into an emoji since the change. Any reason for that? Maybe it's intentional.
[2018-05-10 13:05:17] <LDaVinciF_twitter> FeedBack: the gitter linux client is consuming 100% of the load from one of my cpus
[2018-05-10 13:24:02] <cbj4074> LDaVinciF_twitter: Yep, I agree that profile updates in SSO services, like Twitter or GitHub, don't seem to be reflected here immediately.
[2018-05-10 13:24:25] <cbj4074> The one I see for you is a dude holding a white cup... not sure if that is the old one or the new one.
[2018-05-10 13:25:06] <cbj4074> I have noticed in the past that not everybody sees the same one. Clearly, there is one or more levels of caching involved with this issue, and I'm not sure that it is within Gitter's control to "fix" the issue entirely.
[2018-05-10 13:28:50] <LDaVinciF_twitter> uhum, I see
[2018-05-10 13:30:23] <LDaVinciF_twitter> that's the old one, the new is a digital painting of mine as an elf ^^'
[2018-05-10 13:31:08] <cbj4074> Hehe, yeah, so it is cached somewhere in the pipeline... the question is where. But, I mean, it's not like you see the old one on Twitter, right? So where is Gitter pulling the image from? We can use the DevTools console to check...
[2018-05-10 13:38:59] <cbj4074> MadLittleMods: Here you go, re: the vertical scrollbars in Dark Theme: [<-LINK->] 
[2018-05-10 13:39:30] <cbj4074> I wonder if the fact that:)isn't converted into an emoji is related to the:slight_smile:change in v19.0.0?
[2018-05-10 15:09:41] <photis> Hi everyone, I’m new here, slowly getting the hang of gitter. The one thing I’m missingterriblyafter hanging out in a few rooms is a way tomutea single user. I’ve seen discussions on this topic dating back 3 years. Is there really no progress in this matter? Am I the only one wanting this (I know I am not)? Is it extremely difficult/low priority?
[2018-05-10 15:11:10] <cbj4074> photis: As you suggested, you're not the only one who wants that ability. The short answer is that Gitter development stalled for quite some time during GitLab's acquisition of the product.
[2018-05-10 15:11:25] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @cbj4074It's intentional ( [<-LINK->] ), [<-LINK->] 
[2018-05-10 15:11:50] <cbj4074> MadLittleMods: Ah, thanks, I should have checked there first 
[2018-05-10 15:12:48] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @photisFor onlookers, here is the issue to track muting of users, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-05-10 15:13:34] <cbj4074> photis: My understanding is that all the effort was being poured into the transition and everything that goes with it, from infrastructure changes to cross-training. That said, development activities have resumed and a new version was pushed out just yesterday. So, thumbs-up the issue (linked just above) and chime-in there; that's the best way to show your desire to see it implemented.
[2018-05-10 15:13:37] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @LDaVinciF_twitterSee [<-LINK->] 
[2018-05-10 15:22:14] <photis> Thank you@cbj4074and@MadLittleMods, I was aware of the open issue in gitlab but found it rather stale (no updates in a year until Eric marked the issue as related to [<-LINK->] three weeks ago) so that’s why I launched my little inquiry here. Very kind of you to explain and point me in the right direction.
[2018-05-10 15:23:06] <cbj4074> photis: No problem, and welcome to Gitter! 
[2018-05-10 15:40:10] <Veyhunk> Can someone tell me What's mean of HQ in GitterHQ
[2018-05-10 15:41:59] <Veyhunk> Thanks
[2018-05-10 15:46:07] <photis> Veyhunk: Head Quarters would be my naive guess
[2018-05-10 15:47:13] <Veyhunk> And than: [<-LINK->] 
[2018-05-10 15:47:20] <Veyhunk> photis: 
[2018-05-10 15:48:03] <Veyhunk> Are they the same
[2018-05-10 15:48:08] <Veyhunk> HQ
[2018-05-10 15:48:36] <MadLittleMods> Veyhunk: I think so
[2018-05-10 15:49:40] <Veyhunk> But it’s a name of project
[2018-05-10 15:50:35] <Veyhunk> I think this name is't suitable
[2018-05-10 15:51:02] <Veyhunk> if HQ is Head Quarters
[2018-05-10 15:54:29] <MadLittleMods> Veyhunk: The decision was made before my time. I'll try asking someone who might know. My guess is that it was just a convention/trend to store all Gitter related things vs naming it the exact product name
[2018-05-10 15:56:00] <Veyhunk> Nice & thank you
[2018-05-10 15:56:05] <Veyhunk> MadLittleMods: 
[2018-05-10 16:02:32] <MadLittleMods> Veyhunk: The reason is someone already took thegittername on GitHub, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-05-10 16:04:11] <stavlor> lol, that account doesn't look like its done anything since 4/14/2008
[2018-05-10 16:08:41] <Veyhunk> But Gitlab has its own name : [<-LINK->] 
[2018-05-10 16:08:57] <Veyhunk> MadLittleMods: 
[2018-05-10 16:17:15] <cbj4074> Someone should reach-out to that dude and ask him to fork-over his GitHub handle.
[2018-05-10 16:19:42] <cbj4074> (then again, that's probably irrelevant, given the move to GitLab)
[2018-05-10 16:20:04] <cbj4074> MadLittleMods: Do you recall if you (or I) ever created an issue for this annoying "message is invisible until you mouse-over it" issue?
[2018-05-10 16:20:11] <cbj4074> It still happens
[2018-05-10 18:10:07] <MadLittleMods> cbj4074: I don't see an issue (I would of added "paint" to it) but it will probably be fixed with the upcoming desktop release based on newer NW.js = newer Chrome. You can try it out here, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-05-10 18:10:53] <MadLittleMods> cbj4074: Found an issue [<-LINK->] 
[2018-05-10 18:12:24] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @VeyhunkRegarding GitLab, I searched Slack and it looks like they just reclaimed the name last year and haven't bothered to move anything over
[2018-05-10 18:13:54] <cbj4074> MadLittleMods: Bingo! That's the one, thank you! 
[2018-05-11 03:20:52] <Veyhunk> MadLittleMods: Thank you
[2018-05-11 07:06:53] <Maccimo> Last time choosing room in left menu ("All Conversations") changes URL in address bar but didn't actually change room displayed.Even more, messages in opened room did not marked as a read automatically while scrolling and even green label "N unread messages above/below" didn't shown anymore.Firefox, Win7WTF and how to fix it?
[2018-05-11 07:35:01] <MadLittleMods> @Maccimo You probably ran into one of these frame mismatch issueshttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/1191
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/1254
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/1833If you switch to another room and back, it should work
[2018-05-11 07:47:03] <wsdjeg> in gitter Android app，when press enter, the message will be send instead of add new line. How to disable this feature.
[2018-05-11 10:21:24] <jpkrohling> I just noticed the option to login via gitlab, but I can't seem to find a way to link my current profile to my gitlab account -- where can I find it ?
[2018-05-11 11:54:55] <tommck> Anyone else using the windows app unable to signin with github? Just gives me a white screen when I try
[2018-05-11 11:58:15] <tommck> and.... of course, I didn't even realize gitlab ran their own stuff for issues and found this: [<-LINK->] 
[2018-05-11 12:03:25] <tommck> hmm.. that solution didn't fix it
[2018-05-11 12:49:07] <cbj4074> tommck: It does sound like the issue you cited... are you sure you put the token in the right place?
[2018-05-11 12:55:14] <tommck> cbj4074: I went to the path specified.. there was no gitter_preferences.json file, so I'm not sure :)
[2018-05-11 12:55:30] <tommck> this file does not exist on my machine: C:\Users\YOUR USERNAME\AppData\Local\Gitter\gitter_preferences.json
[2018-05-11 12:55:46] <tommck> I created it and added the setting, but it did nothing
[2018-05-11 13:00:35] <cbj4074> tommck: You're using the desktop app, correct?
[2018-05-11 13:00:43] <cbj4074> (not a regular old browser)
[2018-05-11 13:01:20] <cbj4074> Also, I assume you are using your actual username, and notYOUR USERNAMEin that path...
[2018-05-11 13:06:37] <tommck> cbj4074: yeah
[2018-05-11 13:06:42] <tommck> hehe.. yes..

[2018-05-11 13:11:34] <tommck> I created the gitter_preferences.json file with this content:```

[2018-05-11 13:12:12] <cbj4074> You havePrograms\Gitter. There's noProgramsin that path
[2018-05-11 13:12:13] <tommck> how?
[2018-05-11 13:12:22] <cbj4074> Go up a level
[2018-05-11 13:12:23] <tommck> oh wow
[2018-05-11 13:12:33] <tommck> I'm an idiot :)
[2018-05-11 13:12:36] <tommck> awesome
[2018-05-11 13:12:52] <cbj4074> Hehe, easy to get lost in there
[2018-05-11 13:13:48] <tommck> that did it :)
[2018-05-11 13:13:52] <tommck> in the desktop app now
[2018-05-11 13:14:47] <cbj4074> 
[2018-05-11 13:15:00] <cbj4074> Not sure what even causes it in the first place, it's a PITA
[2018-05-11 13:15:30] <tommck> yeah.. pretty strange
[2018-05-11 14:37:59] <glaksmono> hi all

[2018-05-11 16:14:16] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @jpkrohlingThere isn't a way to link other accounts yet. You can sign out and sign back in to which will create a new user with a_gitlabsuffix in the username

[2018-05-13 08:29:22] <Cubxity> is there gitter dark theme for mobile

[2018-05-14 07:37:58] <radu-munteanu> hi, does anyone knows where I can get a rhel package for gitter? is everyone using debian distros?! :/
[2018-05-14 09:03:48] <MadLittleMods> @radu-munteanu You can run it from source, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/desktop/There is this MR but it's stuck atm https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/desktop/merge_requests/196
[2018-05-14 11:09:56] <bender-nvkz> Gitter support calls?
[2018-05-14 17:27:25] <RoyalBN> bender-nvkz: I'm not sure...
[2018-05-14 17:31:33] <InternetUnexplorer> bender-nvkz: I don't believe Gitter offers phone support at the moment. For bug reports/feature suggestions, you can use the [<-LINK->] . For  other matters you should [<-LINK->] . Hope that helps.

[2018-05-16 09:30:15] <tunnell> Is it possible to rename a Gitter room?  I have a private room in our organization ( [<-LINK->] ) that I'd like to rename to [<-LINK->] .  If I just create a new room and delete the old one, we'd lose history.
[2018-05-16 15:28:09] <mcarpenterjr> MadLittleMods: did I see something awhile back about gitter integrating into gitlab? or was that just the migration from github to gitlab?
[2018-05-16 15:33:56] <cbj4074> mcarpenterjr: You did. GitLab acquired Gitter.
[2018-05-16 15:48:34] <mcarpenterjr> cbj4074: this might be more of a gitlab question but,  do we know what that does for the future of mattermost and gitlab?
[2018-05-16 16:19:14] <cbj4074> mcarpenterjr: Yeah, not sure on that one... maybe@MadLittleModscan shed some light on that
[2018-05-16 17:02:46] <bryevdv> I'd like to ask, once again, that you please show@namesin mobile clients. I need to @ message someone right now, but their screen name is not similar to their user name (which I don't know) and there is just evidently no way to find out (it dies not show up in the short auto compete box)
[2018-05-16 17:12:19] <mcarpenterjr> bryevdv: rasie an issue on gitlab?
[2018-05-16 17:14:52] <mcarpenterjr> cbj4074: yea, I think I've asked this before too, just want to make sure I'm not on the path for disaster we're going to start leveraging mattermost more and if it splits from the omnibus I'd like to handle that now instead of later.
[2018-05-16 17:36:06] <bryevdv>  [<-LINK->] ?
[2018-05-16 17:41:39] <cbj4074> bryevdv: What are you asking? :) If that's the source-code the client we're using here?
[2018-05-16 17:42:08] <cbj4074> Oh, missed your message, above, you're directing@mcarpenterjrto the repo  My bad!
[2018-05-16 17:43:38] <bryevdv> I'm asking where specifically to submit an issue
[2018-05-16 17:45:17] <mcarpenterjr> 
[2018-05-16 18:20:13] <MadLittleMods>  May 16, 2018 4:30 AM @tunnell There isn't a way to rename a room but you can email support@gitter.im with the details and we can manually fix it upI see your membership is already public  https://github.com/orgs/XENON1T/people
[2018-05-16 18:25:26] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @mcarpenterjrCurrently , there aren't any plans to use Gitter in place of Mattermost in the GitLab Omnibus package. See "What about Mattermost, how is this different?" in [<-LINK->] 
[2018-05-16 18:27:19] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @bryevdv@mcarpenterjrYou can track [<-LINK->] for username next to display name in the mobile apps
[2018-05-16 18:44:18] <mcarpenterjr> MadLittleMods: Thanks! That's also clarified gitter's role for me. 
[2018-05-16 19:32:27] <bryevdv> Thanks!
[2018-05-17 09:35:07] <msudgh> Hey, I'm trying to create a room with namephizogand Gitter didn't allow me to going next step and in the name validation request i saw that{"type": "GH_ORG"}. what suppose to mean?Also I have an organization with namephizog. could be related that?
[2018-05-17 09:40:19] <MadLittleMods> msudgh: The GitHub org needs to be associated in order for you to create a Gitter community with the same name. If you don't see the GitHub org auto-associated or in the list when you click "github projects" on the create community first step, see [<-LINK->] 
[2018-05-17 09:55:38] <msudgh> MadLittleMods: ;) thanks. [<-CODE->] Arch release are related to here?
[2018-05-17 09:57:29] <MadLittleMods> msudgh: Those are unofficial. Our apps are listed here [<-LINK->] 
[2018-05-17 10:00:33] <msudgh> MadLittleMods: Don't have any plan to create an official release on Arch? Currently, it's on3.1.0which i saw you have released4.0.0version.
[2018-05-17 11:24:54] <MadLittleMods> msudgh: 4.0.0 isn't released yet. I just updated the changelog this morning in anticipation of the planned soft-release today
[2018-05-17 11:26:03] <MadLittleMods> Which type of package does Arch use? No plans to release on Arch but there is this stale MR for.rpm, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-05-17 13:42:30] <benoitc> hrm what is this Gitter User Prod that want to access to my gitlab ?
[2018-05-17 13:42:58] <benoitc>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-05-17 17:19:44] <MadLittleMods> benoitc: It's the OAuth application name Gitter uses to read your GitLab account (sign in with GitLab)
[2018-05-17 19:16:31] <benoitc> hrm odd it didn't sound legit
[2018-05-17 19:17:03] <benoitc> wonder why it was displayed suddenly also , did something change rcently?
[2018-05-17 19:19:47] <MadLittleMods> @benoitc What do you mean displayed suddenly? Were you already signed in?My assumption so far was that you tried to sign in with GitLab
[2018-05-17 19:33:31] <darrylmorley> HI, could somebody please advise how to stop gitter running in the background on linux. I only want notifications when I run the app manually.
[2018-05-17 20:00:16] <darrylmorley> and why does gitter constantly change process id so you can't kill it?
[2018-05-17 20:22:22] <MadLittleMods> darrylmorley: There isn't a setting to stop Gitter running in the background. You can see the tray icon by following these instructions [<-LINK->] and exit the app completely from there
[2018-05-17 20:23:03] <MadLittleMods> darrylmorley: I'm not sure why it would change process IDs. Perhaps you mean each notification has it's own process ID which is probably the case because use use [<-LINK->] in 3.x
[2018-05-18 06:58:49] <anddam> hello, is there a way I can search my own messages in a room?
[2018-05-18 08:04:12] <0xa1ch3mist_twitter> How long does it take gitter to reflect a name changed in twitter?
[2018-05-18 09:19:16] <ghost~5928d90bd73408ce4f629b9e> 0xa1ch3mist_twitter: i also ask this days ago and they said there is currently a bug   [<-LINK->] 
[2018-05-18 10:30:11] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @anddamYou can use thefrom:anddamsyntax to search for your own messages
[2018-05-18 14:56:57] <anddam> MadLittleMods: thanks, I was missing thefrom:. Is there a full list of those search operators? Liketo:or the like
[2018-05-18 18:14:28] <MadLittleMods> @anddam I think that is the only one, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/1271400674b08d698b249483d0b596957f7e26d0/server/services/chat-search-service.js#L13 [<-CODE->] 
[2018-05-18 22:49:34] <darrylmorley> MadLittleMods: Hi Eric, thanks for the response. and the pointer.
[2018-05-19 03:24:30] <SeanHendlin_twitter> What chatroom on gitter is appropriate to speak with blockchain devs? I can't seem to find one but heard this was the place to come.
[2018-05-19 08:08:50] <YashBalhara> Hi, I just downloaded the Gitter app for windows 10 but I can't login with my github on it, whereas login with twitter and gitlab works just fine; is there a way to resolve this? Because I only want to use my github to login.
[2018-05-19 08:09:38] <YashBalhara> The screen just goes blank when i click on login with github
[2018-05-19 10:34:34] <MadLittleMods> YashBalhara: See [<-LINK->] 
[2018-05-19 11:04:14] <YashBalhara> MadLittleMods: Thanks! It worked
[2018-05-19 12:07:09] <0xa1ch3mist_twitter> SeanHendlin_twitter: There are so many! Anything specific you are looking for ?
[2018-05-21 11:00:03] <shanibaba786> hello i am having a problem my git app stuck at login page

[2018-05-21 17:38:26] <Licenser> hello everyone, I was wondering is there a way to link accounts?
[2018-05-21 17:56:43] <MadLittleMods> Licenser: No. You can track [<-LINK->] as it will probably come along with that
[2018-05-21 17:57:04] <Licenser> ah cool thanks Eric!
[2018-05-21 18:01:47] <Licenser> much appriciated!
[2018-05-21 23:57:31] <se5a> this is probability a bit of a stretch, but have there been any reports of gitter + firefox freezing up linux systems? I get occasional freeze ups which require a hard reboot, which I've been unable to trace the cause of, I've recently noticed it only seems to happen when I've got gitter open in firefox, for a while I ran gitter in chromuim and the problem went away. started using it on firefox again and it re-appeared. might be completely coincidental but...shrugit's the best correlation I can find.
[2018-05-22 00:39:33] <cbj4074> se5a: Not sure, but somebody did mention excessive/pegged CPU on Linux, but I recall it being in the Desktop client (which is Chromium-based).
[2018-05-22 00:39:54] <cbj4074> (it was only a week or two ago)
[2018-05-22 00:59:03] <MadLittleMods> @se5a Are you able to kill the tab? Is the whole system completely unresponsive?With a long-running Gitter tab, I sometimes have to open the Chrome task manager and kill the tab because it becomes unresponsive. I usually have devtools open so it might be related to Chrome filling up with too many logs. Definitely deserves some more debugging at some pointRelated issues, (please create a new separate issue if you have some more concrete details)https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/827

[2018-05-23 08:47:16] <dylangerdaly> If I make a community is private by default hey?
[2018-05-23 08:47:25] <dylangerdaly> No one can just join the community?
[2018-05-23 09:11:46] <MadLittleMods> dylangerdaly: You can't join a community, only rooms. You can make all rooms in the community private though

[2018-05-23 15:42:13] <MadLittleMods> Yoginth_gitlab: Answered your question in the contributing room,  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-05-25 15:47:20] <damienwebdev> I have a public repo, on a github org, where I'm a public member/owner, and I can't create a gitter room for my project. I tried following [<-LINK->] but can't seem to get it figured out. Any tips?
[2018-05-25 15:52:11] <MadLittleMods> damienwebdev: Do you have the Gitter community associated with the GitHub org created (use the + button on the menu bar (bottom-left))?
[2018-05-25 15:52:56] <damienwebdev> Just figured it out. Had to revoke Oauth scope for personal and re-add it.
[2018-05-25 16:47:32] <MadLittleMods> damienwebdev: If the token was still valid, it shouldn't be necessary. Did you revoke so that you could see the org grant access page (it's available in the GitHub OAuth app settings)?
[2018-05-25 16:57:32] <damienwebdev> Yes.
[2018-05-25 17:07:48] <MadLittleMods> @damienwebdev Is there some way I can clarify the instructions that you can grant org access to the OAuth app on GitHub (no need to revoke to see the page again)?I can add something in but wondering what exact words would of clarified it for you
[2018-05-25 18:06:35] <guico33> Hi, I have troubles logging in with the windows desktop app. When I click "login with Github", the window becomes blank and nothing happens after that.Has anyone encountered a similar issue or has an idea of how to solve it?
[2018-05-25 18:07:01] <MadLittleMods> guico33: See [<-LINK->] 
[2018-05-25 18:07:30] <guico33> Will have a look, thanks!Now works like a charm!
[2018-05-26 06:08:41] <orar> Hi, im on linux - ubuntu. I like the feature where you hover on a github issue and a popover appears. It shows actions like mention,  open in github. Sometimes,  i open in github just to subscribe the thread. Is it possible there be a feature/action just to watch the issue or subscribe without opening a new tab
[2018-05-26 12:44:00] <p100x9> guico33: I have the same problem. Just installed 3.1.0 and I can't login as well. I've sent a ticket on the support page.
[2018-05-26 15:27:28] <ghetolay> Hi, how do I create a room for my github organisation ?
[2018-05-26 15:28:03] <ghetolay>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-05-26 15:28:05] <ghetolay> not sure what this means
[2018-05-26 15:35:55] <ghetolay> ok figured it out
[2018-05-26 17:14:10] <zarembastian_twitter> how do I log out from the mac client?
[2018-05-26 17:14:23] <zarembastian_twitter> used twitter instead of GitHub, but I can’t log out now
[2018-05-26 17:17:00] <vassyz> found it, from the menu bar
[2018-05-26 19:31:13] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @orarrIt's probably possible. Create an issue, [<-LINK->] . The relevant code is inpublic/js/views/chat/decorators/issueDecorator.js. If you want to submit a merge request, work from [<-LINK->] since that code was refactored a bit
[2018-05-26 19:31:37] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @p100x9See [<-LINK->] (it was linked just above where you asked)
[2018-05-27 02:36:43] <p100x9> MadLittleMods: Thanks a lot! Fixed the issue!
[2018-05-29 08:46:25] <orar> MadLittleMods: Alright, I would work on it
[2018-05-29 17:51:40] <philandy> Hey is asciidocs (vice md) also supported like on github?
[2018-05-29 18:46:03] <MadLittleMods> philandy: I don't think so. You can try out syntax here [<-LINK->] 
[2018-05-30 07:09:02] <ruslo> Hi, I just updated to Gitter Desktop 4.0.0 and noticed new behavior. When I click on some http link from chat the page is opened in new Gitter window instead of my default browser. Can I change it back to old behavior somehow?
[2018-05-30 07:25:18] <MadLittleMods> @ruslo Thanks for the feedback. Mind creating an issue? https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/desktop/issuesIt looks like we might need to implement a hook on http://docs.nwjs.io/en/latest/References/Window/#event-new-win-policy-frame-url-policy
[2018-05-30 07:27:08] <ruslo> MadLittleMods: Done: [<-LINK->] 
[2018-05-30 07:28:35] <MadLittleMods> ruslo: Thanks :slight_smile:, I'll tackle it in the morning with fresh eyes
[2018-05-31 14:28:19] <TallTed> MadLittleMods: - Any knowledge of an issue for the status bubbles, such that a user-mention (now flagged by@in orange circle) doesn't obscure the message count (normally shown as x≤100 in green circle)?  My preference would be for a distinct signal -- perhaps the@alongside the count -- as the color diff isn't enough for colorblind and other visually impaired users.
[2018-05-31 15:36:15] <MadLittleMods> TallTed: "unread indicator", see [<-LINK->] 
[2018-05-31 19:50:42] <TallTed> MadLittleMods: - Tnx. Are you using anything other than "watchers" to track (user) interest in these issues, towards prioritization?
[2018-05-31 20:58:29] <MadLittleMods> TallTed: The prioritization currently is addressing some of the major pain points and tech debt that has been sitting around. But we are happy to review your merge requests if you want to fix an issue
[2018-06-01 14:25:56] <TallTed> @MadLittleMods  - Let me put that another way... What's the best way for users (especially those of us who aren't active coders) to make known to you that an issue is a pain point for us (though it may not be for you)?  Thumb up the issue, tick "Notifications" on the issue, something else?(I've been clicking "Notifications" but haven't been consistent with the thumb-up ... is there a way on gitlab to see everything I'm getting "Notifications" on?)
[2018-06-01 14:32:52] <cbj4074> TallTed: In case he doesn't respond, the thumbs-up is pretty standard. I can't imagine that the devs have any better way to know which issues are most important to the user-base.
[2018-06-01 14:34:29] <cbj4074> (and I'm not sure, re: seeing all Issues to which one has subscribed for notifications)
[2018-06-01 16:06:42] <MadLittleMods> @TallTed @cbj4074  is a good way but I am not actively sorting by popularity atmSome of it comes down to how much time I have to spend helping people do something or figure out a problem. Example: I have to manually delete accounts at the moment and there is a steady stream of support tickets , https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/merge_requests/1169One of the big ones is decoupling unreads from emails. This is a common complaint because you get a bunch of emails when your notifications are set to "Announcements", https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/1205Something a bit smaller is not embedding gists because they are disruptive and not useful in their current form, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/1399 [<-CODE->] 
[2018-06-01 16:13:54] <MadLittleMods> TallTed: You can find all of the issues you gave a  to with this link, [<-LINK->] . I don't know how to see issues you subscribed to notifications on (looks to not be implemented, [<-LINK->] )
[2018-06-01 16:46:37] <TallTed> MadLittleMods: - Thanks for the links.  I can understand prioritizing case-generating issues above others, and coming to a different order of attention than I.  I am just hoping (because I'm currently forced to use Gitter for some comms) to prevent the common developer myopia that says "the thing I hate most is what my users hate most" and avoids learning what usersreallyhate most.
[2018-06-01 17:35:23] <MadLittleMods> @TallTed I understand. One of the main angles I am coming from is the greatest wins that could improve the Gitter experienceThis isn't metric based but is coming from my personal Gitter woes using the app and my experience triaging the community for years
[2018-06-01 18:20:12] <cbj4074> FWIW, all of the things noted   [<-LINK->] cause me great angst. :)
[2018-06-01 18:20:30] <cbj4074> (add to that the inability to ignore/squelch individual users)
[2018-06-01 18:20:40] <cbj4074> (and report them as absusive)
[2018-06-01 18:20:52] <cbj4074> (or to better moderate channels in general)
[2018-06-01 19:18:36] <chiroptical> Can one allow anonymous users into a gitter.im chat? I would like to embed a chat room on my website without the need to log in.
[2018-06-01 19:18:59] <chiroptical> I found an archive where it definitely was not supported, not sure if it has changed. Thanks.
[2018-06-01 19:25:47] <chiroptical> Found this [<-LINK->] , sorry.
[2018-06-01 19:30:28] <proptrot13> gitter app rated like 1 star
[2018-06-01 19:30:41] <proptrot13> gonna fix it?
[2018-06-01 20:33:22] <MadLittleMods> proptrot13: Which app, Android/iOS? What problem are you running into?
[2018-06-03 04:17:25] <automattable_twitter> Is there a way to sign out in the macos desktop client?
[2018-06-03 04:17:45] <automattable_twitter> (or to sign in with multiple accounts?)
[2018-06-03 05:33:01] <MadLittleMods> automattable_twitter: Sign out is in the menu bar tray icon at the top. There isn't a way to sign in with multiple accounts
[2018-06-03 11:17:11] <srx09> Hi, I am quite new to Gitter iOS app, but unfortunately i am unable to authorize with github. The screen on my phone is simply stuck at Authorise gitterHQ green button being inactive.I tried restarting the app, waiting for 5 minutes, logging in with email address instead of username, but so far with no success.
[2018-06-03 11:34:54] <srx09> After a few more attempts, the issue is gone.
[2018-06-03 22:37:51] <SellersC> Hey yall is there a bootstrap gitter channel?
[2018-06-03 23:30:36] <MadLittleMods> SellersC: You can use the seach under the magnifying glass icon in the menu bar on the left. Or just simply google "bootstrap gitter", [<-LINK->] 
[2018-06-04 03:05:58] <proptrot13> eric: eastwood im not talking about a specific issue but being rated that low made me hesitate downloading it
[2018-06-04 03:06:32] <proptrot13> And on iOS
[2018-06-04 03:14:05] <MadLittleMods> proptrot13: No plans to update the iOS/Android apps in the near future. If you run into some problem, I can point you to an issue you can track and may have a workaround
[2018-06-04 11:21:39] <radu-munteanu_gitlab> can we have the account name changed on gitter? I want the gitlab login to be without any suffix, and the github one with suffix.
[2018-06-04 11:24:46] <radu-munteanu> so this one to be _github... and the one above without _gitlab
[2018-06-04 13:02:26] <irlcatgirl> MadLittleMods: Just a note on iPhone apps, one of my friends let me know that the iPhone app doesn't support iPhone X's screen size
[2018-06-04 13:02:31] <irlcatgirl> Is their an open issue on that
[2018-06-04 13:04:32] <wengych_gitlab> Does gitter support  self-hosted deployment along with gitlab?
[2018-06-04 13:05:48] <irlcatgirl> wengych_gitlab: It's possible to deploy Gitter and make it remotely accessible, as well as use your own API Keys
[2018-06-04 13:06:02] <irlcatgirl> I'm not sure that it's intended for you to use it that way, but it's possible.
[2018-06-04 13:06:21] <irlcatgirl> It's unclear whether Gitter will integrate with self hosted GitLab
[2018-06-04 13:06:44] <irlcatgirl> That said, nothing is preventing you from making your own changes as its open source
[2018-06-04 13:07:15] <wengych_gitlab> Do you mean just change the code and deploy gitter by hand ?
[2018-06-04 13:07:37] <wengych_gitlab> Got it.
[2018-06-04 13:08:02] <irlcatgirl> Basically
[2018-06-04 13:08:48] <wengych_gitlab> I use mattermost with gitlab together before :)
[2018-06-04 13:09:35] <irlcatgirl> As for as I know the source code repo is designed for running gitter.im, not self hosted deployments, then again its open source so you can edit it to do anything you desire
[2018-06-04 13:09:53] <wengych_gitlab> But Mattermost is not very stable 
[2018-06-04 13:10:29] <irlcatgirl> If you like Gitter use it, why not use Gitter.im directly
[2018-06-04 13:10:33] <irlcatgirl> Is their a reason you need to self host?
[2018-06-04 13:11:17] <radu-munteanu> wengych_gitlab: from what I know, GitLab made a post on their site when they aquired Gitter. There is an Open Source Gitter on the works, but it's not ready yet.
[2018-06-04 13:11:45] <wengych_gitlab> Yeah, so I'm looking forward,,
[2018-06-04 13:12:16] <irlcatgirl> See: [<-LINK->] 
[2018-06-04 13:12:47] <irlcatgirl> It's designed for running Gitter as a service
[2018-06-04 13:12:49] <irlcatgirl> not Gitter standalone
[2018-06-04 13:12:56] <irlcatgirl> that might be released in later updates though
[2018-06-04 13:13:40] <wengych_gitlab> So it looks like Mattermost is better for privacy projects.
[2018-06-04 13:13:51] <the-j0k3r> Hello
[2018-06-04 13:23:57] <irlcatgirl> wengych_gitlab: Not really
[2018-06-04 13:24:17] <irlcatgirl> Neither Gitter nor Mattermost is end to end encrypted and relies on the security of your server
[2018-06-04 13:24:33] <wengych_gitlab> Do you mean https and local-network ?
[2018-06-04 13:24:36] <irlcatgirl> Hi@the-j0k3r
[2018-06-04 13:24:42] <irlcatgirl> wengych_gitlab: No I do not
[2018-06-04 13:24:54] <irlcatgirl> both mattermost and gitter control the HTTPS keys
[2018-06-04 13:25:03] <irlcatgirl> When I said end to end encryption I mean encryption done by the apps
[2018-06-04 13:25:09] <irlcatgirl> where the server has zero knowledge
[2018-06-04 13:25:18] <irlcatgirl> for hopefully obvious reasons
[2018-06-04 13:25:33] <wengych_gitlab> em, end to end is not the key for enterprise
[2018-06-04 13:25:42] <irlcatgirl> Very true
[2018-06-04 13:25:47] <irlcatgirl> So then use Gitter
[2018-06-04 13:25:55] <irlcatgirl> There's no more or less risk in using Gitter self hosted
[2018-06-04 13:25:58] <irlcatgirl> than mattermost self hosted
[2018-06-04 13:25:59] <wengych_gitlab> host Gitter inside the office ?
[2018-06-04 13:26:07] <irlcatgirl> If you choose to
[2018-06-04 13:26:17] <wengych_gitlab> 
[2018-06-04 13:26:17] <irlcatgirl> you'll likely need to get some edits done to make it work properly
[2018-06-04 13:26:28] <irlcatgirl> I have no idea of your use case
[2018-06-04 13:26:32] <wengych_gitlab> maybe
[2018-06-04 13:26:42] <wengych_gitlab> I choose to wait for gitlab
[2018-06-04 13:27:09] <wengych_gitlab> maybe they will change something on Gitter to make it easier for self-hosted Gitter.
[2018-06-04 13:31:00] <irlcatgirl> wengych_gitlab: Possibly
[2018-06-04 13:31:07] <irlcatgirl> I'm not sure that its a priority
[2018-06-04 13:31:14] <irlcatgirl> Why not use Gitter.im and create a room for your project
[2018-06-04 13:31:27] <wengych_gitlab> In house
[2018-06-04 13:31:38] <wengych_gitlab> Local network, self host
[2018-06-04 13:31:42] <the-j0k3r> nsuchy: maybe you can help me with some organization I created
[2018-06-04 13:31:43] <irlcatgirl> your best option is probably hosting on the internal network then
[2018-06-04 13:31:58] <irlcatgirl> the-j0k3r: are you interested in self hosting or using gitter.im?
[2018-06-04 13:32:16] <the-j0k3r> gitter Im
[2018-06-04 13:32:40] <the-j0k3r> essentially I wanted to delete two I created as a test
[2018-06-04 13:32:40] <irlcatgirl> You should be able to press the plus button towards the bottom left and create a room
[2018-06-04 13:32:47] <irlcatgirl> oh
[2018-06-04 13:32:53] <the-j0k3r> :)
[2018-06-04 13:33:00] <the-j0k3r> and maybe rename another?
[2018-06-04 13:33:00] <irlcatgirl> you need to delete a room?
[2018-06-04 13:33:07] <the-j0k3r> not room
[2018-06-04 13:33:37] <the-j0k3r> So let me explain, I was creating a dark theme for gitter
[2018-06-04 13:33:56] <irlcatgirl> See: [<-LINK->] 
[2018-06-04 13:34:05] <irlcatgirl> Looks like you'll need support to do this for now
[2018-06-04 13:34:10] <the-j0k3r> so I created a text organization
[2018-06-04 13:34:19] <the-j0k3r> that doesnt apply afaiks
[2018-06-04 13:34:43] <the-j0k3r> *text -> test
[2018-06-04 13:35:03] <the-j0k3r> its not on the FAQ been there and RTFM
[2018-06-04 13:35:27] <the-j0k3r> all it says is email gitter
[2018-06-04 13:35:53] <the-j0k3r> but I was hoping one of you guys could do it without me emailing
[2018-06-04 13:36:58] <irlcatgirl> There does not appear to be a way to accomplish this at the moment
[2018-06-04 13:37:35] <irlcatgirl> It's probably better for you to install a development copy of gitter on your laptop for testing purposes
[2018-06-04 13:41:22] <the-j0k3r> nsuchy: so can you help me or do I have to send an email like in 1980
[2018-06-04 13:41:28] <the-j0k3r> :)
[2018-06-04 13:42:13] <irlcatgirl> You will have to send an email
[2018-06-04 13:42:31] <irlcatgirl> I'm just a motiviated community user, I am NOT stuff of GitLab B.v. nor GitLab
[2018-06-04 13:42:35] <the-j0k3r> :( and then you open it and do it :)
[2018-06-04 13:42:39] <irlcatgirl> I don't have access to their internal systems
[2018-06-04 13:42:39] <the-j0k3r> OKOK
[2018-06-04 13:42:52] <the-j0k3r> ah
[2018-06-04 13:43:54] <the-j0k3r> Well mistake number one, like a n00b I assumed you worked for gitter
[2018-06-04 13:44:00] <the-j0k3r> hahaha
[2018-06-04 13:47:19] <irlcatgirl> lol
[2018-06-04 13:47:42] <wengych_gitlab> 
[2018-06-04 13:47:55] <irlcatgirl> still learning these emojis
[2018-06-04 13:47:56] <irlcatgirl> :/
[2018-06-04 13:48:44] <the-j0k3r> GitHub emojis... yea, IDK who came up with them but they dont have most common things
[2018-06-04 13:49:25] <irlcatgirl> A lot of difficult things with self hosting Gitter are running it as a private, not a public service
[2018-06-04 13:49:39] <irlcatgirl> For example only allowing people from your gitlab server to register
[2018-06-04 13:49:40] <wengych_gitlab> must be
[2018-06-04 13:50:12] <wengych_gitlab> register should be disabled
[2018-06-04 13:50:22] <wengych_gitlab> because the user is available in both system.
[2018-06-04 13:50:54] <wengych_gitlab> hope gitlab will do the integration
[2018-06-04 13:51:39] <wengych_gitlab> will be very valuable 
[2018-06-04 13:53:08] <irlcatgirl> At some point
[2018-06-04 13:53:14] <irlcatgirl> I don't think enterprise features are a priority
[2018-06-04 13:53:21] <irlcatgirl> If they are developed it'll likely be a paid fork
[2018-06-04 13:53:35] <irlcatgirl>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-06-04 13:53:39] <irlcatgirl> Finally have my own testing enviroment setup
[2018-06-04 13:53:49] <irlcatgirl> I have patches to write now
[2018-06-04 13:54:21] <wengych_gitlab> talk with yourself ? 
[2018-06-04 14:01:37] <the-j0k3r> Of course talking to himself@wengych_gitlabdo you know any other way to get an inteligent conversation on the web?
[2018-06-04 14:07:35] <the-j0k3r> Ok thanks@nsuchyttyl
[2018-06-04 14:11:14] <irlcatgirl> wengych_gitlab: sure lol
[2018-06-04 14:11:26] <irlcatgirl> I have to have a way to make API calls to test any changes I make
[2018-06-04 14:11:45] <irlcatgirl> the-j0k3r: let me know if you need further information and I'll see what I can do
[2018-06-04 16:11:02] <Adam24> Off topic but Micro$oft has acquired github.
[2018-06-04 16:15:10] <cbj4074> Yep, a sad day for all. :(
[2018-06-04 16:15:50] <cbj4074> (except for companies like GitLab, who will probably see a huge surge of users who are frantically jumping-ship as we speak)
[2018-06-04 16:17:58] <Adam24> Yep
[2018-06-04 16:19:47] <wengych_gitlab> yep but gitlab accepted a lot 500 LOL
[2018-06-04 16:21:47] <Adam24> Lol
[2018-06-04 17:26:39] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @radu-munteanu_gitlabIt isn't possible to remove the username suffix, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-06-04 17:28:29] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @nsuchyYou can track [<-LINK->] 
[2018-06-04 17:29:43] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @wengych_gitlabThere are instructions to setup your own Dockerized development version of Gitter in the webapp readme, [<-LINK->] . But we don't have instructions for a more production-ready setup
[2018-06-04 17:34:54] <wengych_gitlab> Do you have any plan on providing a production level and gitlab integrated self-hosted installation vision?@MadLittleMods
[2018-06-04 17:41:55] <irlcatgirl> Thanks@MadLittleMods
[2018-06-04 17:43:05] <MadLittleMods> https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter?at=5b15783ef9f2e56cf23dbc60 @wengych_gitlab No plans at the moment.The Dockerized version should get you pretty far though unless you are running it for a very large org
[2018-06-04 17:43:51] <wengych_gitlab> Got it, thank you so much.
[2018-06-04 19:30:02] <irlcatgirl> wengych_gitlab: What exactly do you need that's not already provided?
[2018-06-04 19:30:52] <irlcatgirl> If you are deploying in production you really have the following requirements:1) Install dockerized version in production mode2) Replace the Gitter home page with your own3) Do some edits to replace the GitHub login with your own SSO and disable the others4) Profit
[2018-06-04 19:31:03] <irlcatgirl> It uses passport.js so switching OAuth Providers is easy
[2018-06-04 20:31:12] <miltonarce> hi
[2018-06-04 20:31:13] <miltonarce> where are other channels?
[2018-06-04 20:51:09] <MadLittleMods> miltonarce: You can use the search under the magnifying glass on the left menu bar to find other rooms. What room are you looking for?
[2018-06-04 20:56:13] <miltonarce> MadLittleMods: Thank you, i dont know. I'm looking for something of my interest.
[2018-06-04 22:45:40] <TallTed> @MadLittleMods - One more thing...  :-/What determines the text colors used for codeblocks in the native Mac app? I'm currently running 3.1.0, and there are several low-contrast pairings — very dark colors on black background — that make the text nearly impossible to read, especially at the unchangeably small font size. I'm hoping (but not really expecting) that there's an easy user-applyable workaround to address this ... and if not, that there's an easy dev-side tweak for the next rev.
[2018-06-04 22:46:47] <MadLittleMods> @TallTed We try to auto-detect a few languages but you can apply the language explicitly```js```htmletc [<-CODE->] 
[2018-06-04 22:48:27] <MadLittleMods> TallTed:  [<-CODE->] holds the theme styles
[2018-06-04 23:05:51] <TallTed> MadLittleMods: That's helpful.  It reveals that there's only one pairing that's a major problem -- though it applies to numerous elements (and a few others that could be improved).See [<-LINK->] and check the last color pair in your CSS --#75715Eon#000000
[2018-06-04 23:19:27] <MadLittleMods> @TallTed  Currently 3.19 contrast on the comment. Mind creating an issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues to track and possibly a merge request? [<-CODE->] Chrome devtools,
[2018-06-04 23:32:15] <TallTed> @MadLittleModsYeah. This, I can patch. :-)Is a PR enough -- i.e., can I just go to the right branch (which?) and edit, following prompts to submit the PR, similar to github (which will be fast, as I've done similar for various other projects)?Or do I have to jump through all the issue, fork, clone, blah, blah, blah steps (which will take me MUCH longer, as it's not my normal gig, and I obviously don't quite know what clicks to make)?
[2018-06-04 23:54:18] <MadLittleMods> TallTed: You can just press edit on the file and that it will automatically create a fork for you
[2018-06-05 01:04:07] <TallTed> MadLittleMods: Great. "You can only edit files when you are on a branch." Which branch is best to start from -- master, develop, other?
[2018-06-05 01:20:49] <MadLittleMods> TallTed: develop(default). We use [<-LINK->] 
[2018-06-05 01:31:08] <TallTed> MadLittleMods: MR1174 submitted.  I look forward to the next minor-update.  :-)
[2018-06-05 01:32:38] <TallTed> MadLittleMods: I notice this goes to the webapp. Will the native app(s) also pick it up?
[2018-06-05 01:39:31] <MadLittleMods> TallTed: Yes, they use a web frame with the webapp inside
[2018-06-05 01:40:29] <MadLittleMods> TallTed: Add a before/after screenshot to your MR, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-06-05 01:45:12] <TallTed> MadLittleMods: That's a less trivial request. I didn't build anything; just changed 4 color values in the CSS.How can I make the changed file take effect locally to produce theafter?Heck, how can I show samples of all classes which colors I've changed, to produce a completebefore?
[2018-06-05 01:47:52] <MadLittleMods> @TallTed A basic JavaScript code snippet will probably cover most things.You will need to setup the Gitter webapp locally in order to see the changes locally, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#install-prerequisitesYou could also adjust the CSS via the devtools on gitter.im
[2018-06-05 01:49:10] <TallTed> sighsFrom each according to their time and willingness to learn how to jump through all the hoops.
[2018-06-05 01:50:39] <MadLittleMods> @TallTed Adjusting 4 values in Chrome devtools is pretty easyIf you haven't seen what it actually looks like, I am guessing the values may need to be adjusted after you actually see the result
[2018-06-05 02:27:48] <TallTed> MadLittleMods: With respect, anything you know how to do is pretty easy...for you.  Representative sample before-and-after added.
[2018-06-05 10:50:21] <Knifa_gitlab> Can I merge Gitter accounts? e.g., I'd rather use my GitLab login rather than my GitHub one.
[2018-06-05 11:06:08] <Knifa_gitlab> Ah, found the FAQ. Oh well.
[2018-06-05 11:06:20] <Knifa_gitlab>  [<-LINK->] for anyone else stumbling upon
[2018-06-05 21:38:03] <12people> I've started using Gitter when it was still Github only. Now that it's added Gitlab as a log-in option, I'd like to use Gitlab instead, but I don't want to have to add each room I'm part of. Is there a way to add Gitlab login to my current account or migrate from Github login to Gitlab login?
[2018-06-05 21:55:21] <irlcatgirl> 12people: This would be better to ask in developers
[2018-06-05 21:55:44] <12people> nsuchy: alright, will do :)
[2018-06-05 21:55:50] <irlcatgirl> :)
[2018-06-05 21:56:02] <irlcatgirl> I'll check on that discussion later and try to help out
[2018-06-05 23:05:10] <MadLittleMods> https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter?at=5b1702bb99fa7f4c064a2f8d @12people @nsuchy This question is the correct room which is for Gitter support.There isn't a way to associate or merge accounts. Your GitLab account will be totally separate and will need to be added to each room you are a member of. Related docs https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/accounts.md#can-i-mergeconnect-my-accounts
[2018-06-05 23:16:17] <irlcatgirl> MadLittleMods: Sorry I may of misinterpreted what@12peoplewas asking.
[2018-06-05 23:56:03] <DarkxPunk> MadLittleMods: That is dumb as fuck… Espeically if you want to bail from GitHub...
[2018-06-05 23:56:56] <nafg> DarkxPunk: it's OSS, please contribute a fix
[2018-06-05 23:57:52] <DarkxPunk> I am def gonna look into something because this needs a proper user profile system… plus can you even sign out of the desktop app XD I cant find a button for that anywhere,,,
[2018-06-05 23:58:42] <DarkxPunk> Yeah its hidden in the menu addition… bloody hell is this convoluded.
[2018-06-06 02:40:48] <MadLittleMods> @DarkxPunk If you are interested in making a merge request, here is the issue to track, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/1752This will probably come along with being able to set a custom username, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/1851
[2018-06-06 04:08:32] <wsdjeg> Hello, I have a github repo, I hope the event of this repo can sent to two channels automanuly, is it possible?
[2018-06-06 04:09:05] <wsdjeg> in current version of github servers I can only link one channel with one github  repo
[2018-06-06 04:09:59] <MadLittleMods> wsdjeg: You can setup a GitHub integration in any room which will show repo activity. Room settings dropdown -> Integrations -> GitHub
[2018-06-06 04:12:30] <wsdjeg> Thank, I got it, I will have a try.
[2018-06-06 04:21:28] <wsdjeg> settings dropdown -> Integrations -> GitHub, then I can not  see the repo from my org
[2018-06-06 04:21:40] <wsdjeg> I have two org, but the other one works well
[2018-06-06 04:21:57] <MadLittleMods> wsdjeg: See [<-LINK->] 
[2018-06-06 06:42:11] <12people> MadLittleMods: alright, thanks for the answer
[2018-06-06 06:45:33] <12people> DarkxPunk: would be grateful for something like this!
[2018-06-07 05:00:13] <Fuzzyma>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-06-07 05:00:23] <Fuzzyma> just loaded gitter and thats what I got
[2018-06-07 05:00:34] <Fuzzyma> (dont mind the blank areas which i deleted)
[2018-06-07 05:01:31] <MadLittleMods> Fuzzyma: Is is persistent if you switch to another room and back?
[2018-06-07 05:01:39] <Fuzzyma> nope
[2018-06-07 05:01:50] <Fuzzyma> only for this room. When I loaded the gitter site it was gone
[2018-06-07 05:01:52] <Fuzzyma> however
[2018-06-07 05:02:00] <Fuzzyma> pressing F5 did not resolve the issue alone
[2018-06-07 05:02:09] <Fuzzyma> instead I had a doubled loading screen:
[2018-06-07 05:02:19] <Fuzzyma>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-06-07 05:03:16] <Fuzzyma> please note that I never close the gitter tab. Its only reloaded when teh browser starts (firefox)
[2018-06-07 05:03:22] <MadLittleMods> Fuzzyma: It doesn't look like you are clicking on yourself but there is a nested frame issue to track that [<-LINK->] 
[2018-06-07 05:03:41] <Fuzzyma> no i didnt
[2018-06-07 05:03:47] <Fuzzyma> could be that issue jeah
[2018-06-07 05:03:57] <Fuzzyma> in my cases it just happened
[2018-06-07 05:04:11] <Fuzzyma> unfortunately i cant dig into that now because i have to go to work
[2018-06-07 05:04:24] <Fuzzyma> just wanted to make sure you heared from that issue
[2018-06-07 05:05:04] <MadLittleMods> Fuzzyma: Thanks for the report. There is a different issue around the restored app frame and chat frame not matching, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-06-07 05:05:48] <Fuzzyma> jeah i had that one too alreadxy
[2018-06-07 05:06:03] <Fuzzyma> but that doesnt match the current issue
[2018-06-07 05:20:59] <wsdjeg> as I remenber there is an icon in gitter web client for get the list of private repo, why I can not see it now
[2018-06-07 05:21:56] <MadLittleMods> @wsdjeg I'm not sure what you are talking about.If you mean that your private repos aren't showing up in the create community/room flows, see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/faq.md#why-isnt-my-github-organisation-or-repos-appearing
[2018-06-07 05:22:16] <wsdjeg> when I click on the top left icon, only seehome, get gitter apps, change theme,  team searvise and signout
[2018-06-07 05:23:04] <wsdjeg>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-06-07 05:23:12] <wsdjeg> I can not see this option
[2018-06-07 05:25:38] <MadLittleMods> wsdjeg: This means that you have already granted private repo access. If you need to grant private repo access on a new org, see [<-LINK->] 
[2018-06-07 05:28:40] <wsdjeg> thanks
[2018-06-07 09:02:34] <alexkubica> Hello guys, I hid a room instead of leaving and now I still see it in my communities. How can I unhide it?

[2018-06-07 22:29:59] <xpe> My top reason for using Gitter is for MathJax. This works well when typing from the browser UI. However, for reasons I don’t understand, MathJax does not parse when I type using the iOS app.

[2018-06-07 22:35:22] <xpe> In the case of backslashes, the parsing is wrong. I tried using dfrac{x}{y} enclosed in double dollar signs.
[2018-06-08 00:04:18] <MadLittleMods> xpe: Please create an issue with the exact input you are trying on iOS, the result on iOS, and the result from the browser (which is I assume what you expect), [<-LINK->] 
[2018-06-08 00:43:48] <xpe> MadLittleMods: 
[2018-06-08 00:44:28] <xpe> MadLittleMods: I would like to report the bug for the iOS client, not the webapp
[2018-06-08 00:44:58] <MadLittleMods> xpe: The webapp repo is the proper place to report iOS bugs
[2018-06-08 16:17:38] <x8x> Which syntax highlighter library does Gitter use and where is the proper place to submit fixes for a specific language?
[2018-06-08 16:40:37] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @x8xhighlight.jsSee [<-LINK->] 
[2018-06-08 16:56:49] <x8x> MadLittleMods: Great, thank you! Am I correct in assuming, it use the whole set ofhighlight.jslanguages and the way to submit changes is to submit them to thehighlight.jsrepo ? Should I then ping you to ask for updatinghighlight.jsversion into Gitter?
[2018-06-08 17:05:48] <MadLittleMods> x8x: You can update thehighlight.jsandgitter-markdown-processordependency in [<-LINK->] after a new version is released
[2018-06-08 17:06:28] <MadLittleMods> x8x: We only auto-detect a few languages for perf but you can specify any syntax manually ```html
[2018-06-08 18:13:47] <x8x> Thank you@MadLittleModsfor the precious infos. On another note, we really like Gitter but there is one feature that could use some improvements and that is the search functionality, just curious if there is any plan on improving it.

[2018-06-09 02:51:30] <rafael.espindola_gitlab> is that something I have to disable on hexchat?
[2018-06-09 02:54:13] <rafael.espindola_gitlab> using "/set net_ping_timeout 0" seems to work
[2018-06-09 05:57:08] <MadLittleMods> rafael: .espindola_gitlab Mind adding your fix to [<-LINK->] ? There is some discussion if you search in [<-LINK->] as well
[2018-06-09 14:18:24] <NightmareJoker2> @rafael.espindola_gitlabSo you allow dots in usernames, but they can't be tagged? Interesting...

[2018-06-09 17:44:09] <bradyt> okay, thank you.
[2018-06-09 17:44:26] <bradyt> maybe i've stretched my VPS to limit, i'll try throttling up as lazy test.

Your tokens have already been revoked and no action is needed

[2018-06-11 18:12:22] <ethanhs> MadLittleMods: I wrote my own client, and I'd like to verify that it wasn't affected. Is there any technical information on the bug?
[2018-06-11 18:20:11] <MadLittleMods> ethanhs: Not yet. But I doubt you are affected unless you copied from desktop repo
[2018-06-11 18:20:49] <ethanhs> Okay, thanks, that shouldn't be an issue then :)

[2018-06-12 13:51:30] <InternetUnexplorer> MadLittleMods: Is there currently any progress being made on open-sourcing the mobile apps? It seems like opening an issue in the repository for the app itself would be better than doing so in the main webapp repository.
[2018-06-12 13:53:16] <kalyan37> Guys is there any salesforce group  which is active . If it is there can you guys please add me ..... Sorry for asking  in this group
[2018-06-12 13:56:42] <MadLittleMods> @InternetUnexplorer We have tracked issues for the mobile apps in the webapp repo this entire time. No progress has been made open sourcing the mobile apps.We recently released a new version of the desktop app v4 and fixed the token leak which was a priority. I'll try to look into the iOS/Android repos and discuss what needs to happen

[2018-06-13 07:25:57] <MadLittleMods> SpaceVimBot: This seems like bot code or config problem. 401 is unauthorized. What request is giving you that response?
[2018-06-13 08:00:23] <wsdjeg> OK
[2018-06-13 08:00:47] <wsdjeg> I will try to fix it， thanks
[2018-06-13 08:10:01] <wsdjeg> OK just login development page of gitter, why my token are changed?

[2018-06-13 08:12:08] <wsdjeg> sorry, I can not understand, will the token change again?
[2018-06-13 08:18:27] <wsdjeg> the admin of gitter should not change the token, at least should mail me before change it.
[2018-06-13 08:19:01] <wsdjeg> I need to update the authorized info.
[2018-06-13 08:35:24] <InternetUnexplorer> wsdjeg: The tokens were leaked due to a bug, and so they were changed to protect your account.
[2018-06-13 08:36:41] <InternetUnexplorer> It's a bit inconvenient, yes, but having to update your token is probably preferable to having your account hacked.
[2018-06-13 08:43:26] <wsdjeg> thanks，I get it.

[2018-06-15 11:52:42] <NightmareJoker2> karl-gustav: It sends JSON objects, assuming they are always valid JSON, it should be straight-foward to determine when an object begins, and when it ends.
[2018-06-15 13:38:37] <karl-gustav> NightmareJoker2: How? Counting how many "{" you encounter and stopping when you reached the same amount of "}"?
[2018-06-15 13:39:19] <karl-gustav> And it's a bit besides the point, the documentation clearly states that we should look for\ras the delimitor

[2018-06-17 08:42:33] <aydwi> Hello. I recently noticed that the API token provided at [<-LINK->] for the Github account [<-LINK->] was changed. Is there a reason it was changed, or is it a periodic procedure and the token is not permanent? I'll appreciate the help

[2018-06-18 14:51:05] <MadLittleMods> karl-gustav: I'm a bit hesitant to possibly break what people already have setup to use it
[2018-06-18 14:58:37] <karl-gustav> MadLittleMods: Of course, but that's the beauty of this fix, it shouldn't break it for anybody. If you read until\nit will still work as it used to, because a JSON parser won't care about a extra whitespace (\r). Same thing if you read by chunks. You can put as much extra whitespace as you want in JSON and it's still perfectly valid JSON!
[2018-06-18 15:49:41] <MadLittleMods> karl-gustav: Have you tried just splitting messages at newlines/\n? I assume the newlines inside the messages are escaped so they literally print\nand not an actual new line
[2018-06-18 18:08:34] <karl-gustav> MadLittleMods: Good point, I have made a pull-request for updating the docs and put you as the reviewer: [<-LINK->]

[2018-06-18 18:41:28] <lazarljubenovic> Pubilc and Private are similar length and start with the same letter lol
[2018-06-19 07:12:51] <seank-com> How do I open an issue on Gitter for OSX?
[2018-06-19 07:16:13] <seank-com> I click Add A Room and  I see a dialog that looks like the one I need and it immediately disappears and is replaced with a fullscreen one inviting me to create a room. I don’t want to create a room I want to add an existing room.
[2018-06-19 07:18:52] <lazarljubenovic> That happens on the web too
[2018-06-19 12:21:51] <cbj4074> seank-com: I believe the terminology is to "Join" a room. I just tried searching for one in the lefthand sidebar, and when I click on it, there's a big, orangeJOIN ROOMbutton at the bottom of the chat window.
[2018-06-19 14:19:06] <MadLittleMods>  June 19, 2018 2:12 AM @seank-com If you want to join an existing room, you can find it via the magnifying glass search in the left menu.The "Add a room" button is for creating a room. If you don't have any communities, it will bring you to the create community flow.
[2018-06-20 09:03:35] <NightmareJoker2> Well, this is super helpful...

[2018-06-20 15:11:32] <MadLittleMods> NightmareJoker2: You can open the devtools via the "Gitter" menu in the top-left of the window
[2018-06-20 17:47:24] <uthemus> Will Gitter release an abandoned community domain if requested?  No rooms were created.
[2018-06-20 18:00:52] <MadLittleMods> uthemus: Possibly. We can try contacting the person who made it first
[2018-06-20 18:42:43] <uthemus> MadLittleMods: PM'd you.
[2018-06-21 07:44:04] <NightmareJoker2> MadLittleMods: there was nothing interesting of note in there... and now I'm getting this:
[2018-06-21 07:44:09] <NightmareJoker2>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-06-21 07:46:14] <MadLittleMods> NightmareJoker2: You can try restarting the app or re-installing
[2018-06-21 07:50:14] <NightmareJoker2> Already did, but I believe I found the problem: it keeps asking me to sign in again, and whenever I do, it signs me out on the website, and vice versa... that's very annoying...
[2018-06-21 07:54:57] <MadLittleMods> NightmareJoker2: Did you revoke the GitHub OAuth apps? It's possible we see a 403 from GitHub and are signing you out
[2018-06-21 08:08:27] <NightmareJoker2> No, but I am not granting you access to my GitHub account email (it contains a special token, I only want GitHub to have)... and this has been working fine (still does). The problem only occurs when I sign into the app (signs me out on the website) and when I sign in on the website (signs me out on the app or causes the "something went wrong" error after a restart).
[2018-06-21 15:34:14] <MadLittleMods> @NightmareJoker2 If you are signing in with GitHub, you are granting access to your email and the public OAuth scope.After signing in, if you revoke the OAuth scope, then there are a few places we check and can sign you out and destroy all of your tokensIf that is not the case, I am not sure what is happening
[2018-06-21 18:24:09] <kdheepak> I think I've created a private room in the past, and want to make a public room in the same name. Is that possible?
[2018-06-21 18:24:20] <kdheepak> Can I rename the old one and create a new one?
[2018-06-21 18:24:29] <kdheepak> Or can someone else do the same?
[2018-06-21 18:24:54] <MadLittleMods> kdheepak: What is the URL of the room you want to create?
[2018-06-21 18:25:45] <kdheepak>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-06-21 18:25:55] <kdheepak> This is the room I originally created.
[2018-06-21 18:26:03] <kdheepak> And it has a lock icon in the top.
[2018-06-21 18:26:17] <kdheepak> ( I'm not sure what that exactly means though )
[2018-06-21 18:26:24] <kdheepak> I want to make the room as open as possible.
[2018-06-21 18:27:05] <MadLittleMods> @kdheepak The lock means private. It isn't possible to change it after creation in the UI, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/676I can update it for you now though
[2018-06-21 18:27:10] <kdheepak> So either converting the room to a public one ( which I know there was a open question that said you didn't want people to do this ) or renaming the room and creating a new public room in its place.
[2018-06-21 18:27:22] <kdheepak> That would be great if you can update it for me!
[2018-06-21 18:28:08] <kdheepak> What does the "private" mean btw? Because other people that weren't part of the github repository were able to join it.
[2018-06-21 18:28:58] <MadLittleMods> kdheepak: They were probably manually added by someone else in the room
[2018-06-21 18:29:46] <kdheepak> I had a fellow colleague open the link to the gitter page and he was able to join the room. And the room is visible even if I open in incognito.
[2018-06-21 18:29:57] <MadLittleMods> kdheepak:  hmmm
[2018-06-21 18:30:40] <kdheepak> Anyway, if you can make it public that would be great. It would not give mixed signals to the people that this room was not private / public
[2018-06-21 18:31:56] <MadLittleMods> @kdheepak Was the repo previously private, https://github.com/NREL/ditto ?The room might of been created back when it was private but now that it is public, anyone can access the repoand therefore can join the room
[2018-06-21 18:33:29] <MadLittleMods> kdheepak: The room is now public  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-06-21 18:41:46] <kdheepak> That is correct! The repo was previously private.
[2018-06-21 18:41:54] <kdheepak> I forgot to mention that.
[2018-06-21 19:46:03] <NightmareJoker2>  [<-CODE->] Also, I may add: Don't use a web view in your application for the authorization flow, doing so defeats the OAuth flow trust training, that should have users learn not to enter their account credentials (username/email + password) in third-party applications. Send them to their web browser instead, and return them to a small web server running locally in your application to pass the authorization code with the refresh token grant. Though this tool being in all reasonable cases a notable exception, users typically do not know how to verify that an application isn't tampering with the login prompt, and rarely bother even, if they can, nor check for unnecessary permission grants and the like.

[2018-06-26 18:47:12] <marek094> Hello!
[2018-06-26 18:47:34] <marek094> is it possible to run gitter locally network
[2018-06-26 18:47:46] <marek094> like GitLab?
[2018-06-26 18:48:27] <marek094> the problem is we do not want to share your messages in Cloud :)
[2018-06-26 18:50:21] <MadLittleMods> marek094: You can run the Dockerized development version, [<-LINK->]

[2018-06-26 18:51:05] <MadLittleMods> marek094: You can edit your previous message with the "Edit" option in the...dropdown in the top-right of every messages
[2018-06-26 18:51:17] <marek094> :D thx
[2018-06-26 18:51:33] <marek094> MadLittleMods: Ok, so if I install it, I we can use it via our VPN, right?
[2018-06-26 18:52:31] <MadLittleMods> marek094: Yes. Anyone who can access the instance
[2018-06-26 18:52:33] <marek094> — what about the integration with mobile app for this local version?
[2018-06-26 18:53:30] <MadLittleMods> @marek094 There isn't a way to point the mobile apps at your local version and the mobile apps aren't open source yet.You can point the desktop client at your local instance via these CLI parameters, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/desktop/#cli-parameters
[2018-06-26 18:53:58] <marek094> ok :) thx
[2018-06-26 18:57:02] <TallTed> MadLittleMods: — New (I think) issue...  Go to a channel with a bunch of unreads, some of which include inlined media/includes.  Click the Unread ^ lozenge.  Channel scrolls to the first unread.  Then it expands inlined media, etc.  — and anything in the lower portion of scroll pushes the renderupinstead ofdown, so the first unread (which is no longer shaded as unread) is (a lot) suddenly offscreen up top, and getting there is not always easy.
[2018-06-26 19:01:49] <MadLittleMods> @TallTed Known but not tracked wellRelated, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/1217The future is probably less embeds, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/1399
[2018-06-26 19:03:06] <TallTed> MadLittleMods: arghalso, when I click from room A to room B and back within (at least short and optimally configurable time, like 30 seconds minimum), the scroll in room A should REMAIN WHERE I LEFT IT

[2018-06-27 05:29:16] <jimtryon> How do you send a DM on the Android version of the Gitter app?
[2018-06-27 05:31:06] <MadLittleMods> jimtryon: If the one to one already exists, you can choose it from your conversation list. You can also use the search in the top-right on the conversation page to find a new person
[2018-06-27 05:37:52] <jimtryon> Yeah, you can chat in ones you already have open.But then when you're, say, in here, there's no indication that you have unread messages in any one-to-one.
[2018-06-27 05:38:47] <MadLittleMods> jimtryon: You can quickly check the slide-out left menu but there isn't a visible indicator looking at a room
[2018-06-28 17:41:37] <mittalyashu77_twitter> Add the option to edit profile.
[2018-06-28 19:50:58] <MadLittleMods> @mittalyashu77_twitter Account information is pulled from the provider you sign in with.

[2018-06-28 20:27:13] <tadni> Am I somehow missing an option to change font-size? I've recently switched from the web-page version to the 'web-app' and the former I would just zoom out like 10 to 20% and worked 'good enough'; Right now on 720 resolution though on this dedicated development/study box and it's really starting to show.

[2018-06-29 17:17:51] <diego-rocha-movile> They are using their GitHub accounts and are members of an organization on GitHub
[2018-06-29 19:02:21] <MadLittleMods> diego-rocha-movile:  Have they joined Gitter yet? Everyone should show up in that typeahead
[2018-06-29 19:07:34] <diego-rocha-movile> MadLittleMods: yes, they have. And can add them to any room but can’t make them admin. I’ll send some screenshots

[2018-06-30 13:47:30] <eklavya> seems to have reset for now :)
[2018-06-30 19:29:12] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @eklavyaThe limit is 100 requests per minute
[2018-06-30 19:31:02] <eklavya> ok
[2018-06-30 19:31:33] <eklavya> if I was not fighting with "Faye" I wouldn't have hit it 
[2018-06-30 19:31:50] <eklavya> I wonder what was wrong with a plain WebSocket api
[2018-06-30 19:32:03] <eklavya> available everywhere and documented
[2018-06-30 19:32:14] <eklavya> 
[2018-06-30 19:34:01] <MadLittleMods> @eklavya There should be plenty of docs around Faye/bayeux/cometdYou can use the completely abstracted https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/realtime-client or this bayeux client which handles things like reconnecting, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/halley
[2018-06-30 19:34:26] <eklavya> looked into them already :(
[2018-06-30 19:34:45] <eklavya> not available in qml/qt
[2018-06-30 19:35:25] <eklavya> the stream api is not working whatever I do and Faye is, well I can't seem to understand what it is 
[2018-06-30 19:36:10] <eklavya> I have just finished getting it to work with a seemingly abandoned cpp project
[2018-06-30 19:36:24] <eklavya> I would have loved to have used just a ws api
[2018-06-30 19:36:52] <eklavya> safe and tested
[2018-06-30 19:37:09] <eklavya> and likely universal
[2018-06-30 19:37:29] <eklavya> I am sorry I have just wasted a lot of effort on this 
[2018-06-30 20:33:48] <tech4him_gitlab> Is there a way to link my GitHub and GitLab logins so I am in the same Gitter account with both?

[2018-07-01 11:34:55] <eklavya> this should do it :D

[2018-07-02 08:17:50] <cyrilphoenix71> :) did you know the android application bug for not read message (sorry for my english, i'm french :))

[2018-07-04 09:40:38] <pmacko1> hey Gitter, I have a suggestion for improvement of message search: I don't find the automatic msg unroll when focused very useful -> when eye-scanning the possible relevant results, it pushes the following messages down and the overall UX is suboptimal
[2018-07-04 12:26:33] <eklavya> the snapshot that comes when you subscribe to a channel, how is that made, from what point forward?or is it a fixed no of messages every time

[2018-07-05 14:34:29] <mistermantas> Usually apps do have a logout, hidden somewhere
[2018-07-05 14:35:11] <guylepage3_twitter> Yes lol. There is always a logout button
[2018-07-05 14:35:49] <guylepage3_twitter> It's also very unclear how to upload an image...

[2018-07-05 14:36:40] <mistermantas> i do that with greenshot, i know other tools like shutter on linux can do the same

[2018-07-05 15:56:35] <TallTed> @MadLittleMods "menu bar icon"?  on macOS, in Gitter.app 4.1.0, in the weird drop-down from my avatar (this is not a menu bar, has no hint that it holds such a drop-down; this is not normal Mac app UI), I have the same as   July 5, 2018 10:37 AM (plus "Allow Private Repo Access")-- i.e., no "sign out" option...@guylepage3_twitter @mistermantas  - The current sign-out on macOS is foud in the Gitter app menu, which is at upper left, in the main menu bar.
[2018-07-05 16:01:27] <MadLittleMods>  July 5, 2018 10:56 AM @TallTedThe menu bar terminology, https://support.apple.com/kb/ph25077It would be nice to include something in the in-app sign out location but  from my macOS usage, it is pretty normal for apps that can run in the backgroundDocker for Mac example, https://i.imgur.com/0elin52.png
[2018-07-05 16:03:30] <TallTed> MadLittleMods: Docker's thing is found in a menu-add-on, which is another special-thing, and developers are not supposed to rely on those -- as they may or may not be visible at any given time, depending on other menu bar items.  (i.e., Docker should have another route to everything you see there.)
[2018-07-05 16:07:12] <TallTed> MadLittleMods: I now see that Gitter also has a menu-add-on, and there'salsoa sign-out there.  (I believe that a previous version of the app [also?] had the sign-out under the avatar ... which does still have a drop-down menu ... which is still weird.)

[2018-07-08 14:11:21] <solarliner_gitlab> Just started using the desktop app under Ubuntu, is there any way to hide the menubar?  It having only one entry feels very redundant from the app menu
[2018-07-08 18:46:53] <MadLittleMods> @solarliner_gitlab There isn't a way to hide it. Issue/Merge request welcome, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/desktop/Probably want a keyboard shortcut and an option in the tray menu to show/hide the menubar. I'm also leaning towards Windows/Linux only since macOS has it up on the top menubar
[2018-07-08 18:47:30] <solarliner_gitlab> Yeah, macOS wouldn't benefit from hiding a menu that has its own place on the DE
[2018-07-08 18:47:41] <solarliner_gitlab> I have zero experience with Electron though
[2018-07-08 18:47:44] <solarliner_gitlab> so there's that
[2018-07-08 18:48:10] <MadLittleMods> solarliner_gitlab: It's NW.js and should be relatively easy if you have used JavaScript a bit before
[2018-07-08 18:48:51] <MadLittleMods> solarliner_gitlab: Post an issue and I can give you some relevant code links and help you
[2018-07-08 18:49:02] <solarliner_gitlab> I'll do that
[2018-07-08 19:00:45] <solarliner_gitlab> Added an issue on the project, thanks
[2018-07-08 19:01:56] <solarliner_gitlab> Also, where's the repo for the mobile app? I'd like to add an issue there, since I'm not able to log in with GitLab

They unblocked the site, but all you get is the text without any styling. I get the following error in the console when accessing gitter.im. [<-CODE->] 
[2018-07-10 13:41:54] <jwsims> Any assistance would be amazing. Thanks!
[2018-07-10 15:32:59] <MadLittleMods> jwsims: It looks like the firewall may need to allow sub-domains,*.gitter.im
[2018-07-11 10:02:08] <orar> I cant start my desktop gitter
[2018-07-11 10:02:13] <orar> i get this error
[2018-07-11 10:02:14] <orar> Created new window in existing browser session.[16054:16058:0711/095913.843369:ERROR:browser_gpu_channel_host_factory.cc(119)]  Failed to launch GPU process.
[2018-07-11 10:03:55] <orar> I use Ubuntu desktop 16.04
[2018-07-11 10:04:40] <orar> on Gitter 4.1.0
[2018-07-11 10:04:46] <orar> Does anyone experience this please?
[2018-07-11 10:05:08] <RoyalBN> are you using a .deb installed version or a snap package ?
[2018-07-11 10:06:15] <orar> .deb
[2018-07-11 10:06:26] <RoyalBN> ok
[2018-07-11 10:09:03] <RoyalBN> Personally, I am using the snap version but maybe you can try to reinstall it.
[2018-07-11 10:09:37] <RoyalBN> Or if it's still not working, you can switch to the snap version, it's the same...
[2018-07-11 10:11:10] <orar> im trying the snap
[2018-07-11 10:11:39] <orar> i have purged and reinstalled 4 times
[2018-07-11 10:12:03] <RoyalBN> ok, snap works well, I never had any probs like that.
[2018-07-11 10:12:33] <RoyalBN> did you check on other forums ?
[2018-07-11 10:13:26] <orar> no. not yet
[2018-07-11 10:13:34] <RoyalBN> ok
[2018-07-11 10:28:00] <orar> alright. thanks@RoyalBN
[2018-07-11 10:28:02] <orar> snap works
[2018-07-11 10:28:32] <RoyalBN> orarr: You're Welcome ! ;)
[2018-07-11 15:45:46] <MadLittleMods>  July 11, 2018 5:02 AM @orarr The Gitter 4.1.0 desktop app was tested on Ubuntu 18From some googling, it looks like this may fix it, https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/2836#issuecomment-337643224. Another issue on the NW.js repo, nwjs/nw.js#5978. It looks like the app runs in the background but the main window fails to appear.
[2018-07-11 15:49:47] <orar> Ok. It looks positive. I would give feedback in a little while
[2018-07-12 08:51:53] <orar> It took so long. lol
[2018-07-12 08:52:59] <orar> MadLittleMods: I installed and it worked out of the box. No export. Quite strange
[2018-07-12 08:53:22] <orar> same file
[2018-07-12 09:21:05] <orar> So i did a restart to refresh and it couldnt start as usual. I had to use sudo.  And it gave this warningATTENTION: default value of option force_s3tc_enable overridden by environment.
[2018-07-12 09:21:36] <orar> and it works
[2018-07-14 20:23:51] <spease> Hi, I've been trying to set my notification settings to mentions and announcements, but I'm still getting email notifications when somebody simply sends a message in a room that I'm in
[2018-07-14 20:24:00] <spease> Is this a known issue?
[2018-07-14 20:24:43] <MadLittleMods> spease: Yes, you have to set your notification settings to "Mute" or just turn off emails. Unreads are currently tied to emails, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-07-15 14:08:18] <hbons> hi, I accidentally posted personal information in my public room. can anyone help me remove it?
[2018-07-15 14:18:24] <hbons> hbons: never mind, I got it
[2018-07-18 21:47:52] <guidouil> Hello Gitter team. I find it pretty hard to reply to someone from the iOS gitter app. From this app I can see the full name of a user but not his@usernamehandle. Can you help me out by adding the username next to the full name? Thanks
[2018-07-18 22:46:28] <MadLittleMods> guidouil: You can track [<-LINK->] 
[2018-07-19 02:42:17] <jorgegonzalez> Hello, I'm trying to create a new community at [<-LINK->] . That link 404s so I assume it's not taken, but when I try to create the community the input field is red and it doesn't let me
[2018-07-19 05:58:20] <MadLittleMods> jorgegonzalez: In order to create thezoecommunity on Gitter, it needs to be associated with the [<-LINK->] org on GitHub
[2018-07-19 06:31:31] <jorgegonzalez> MadLittleMods: I created [<-LINK->] , but that's not associated with a GitHub org, just a regular repo ?
[2018-07-19 11:30:32] <MadLittleMods> jorgegonzalez: The [<-LINK->] community isn't associated with anything
[2018-07-19 11:31:29] <MadLittleMods> We currently reserve the same URLs as what exists on GitHub. Because [<-LINK->] exists, it needs to be associated with the Gitter community in order to create it
[2018-07-19 13:44:20] <anddam> is it possible to browse all existing rooms for a project?
[2018-07-19 17:31:33] <bradyt> I linked a github issue in a gitter chat channel, and it was automatically abbreviated and hyperlinked.
[2018-07-19 17:32:23] <bradyt> Today, when I go back to look at it, it's still abbreviated, but the linking is gone.
[2018-07-19 17:32:33] <bradyt> Is that a Gitter thing?
[2018-07-19 17:33:51] <bradyt> Hmm, maybe javascript had to refresh or something. It's linked again now.
[2018-07-19 17:34:07] <bradyt> I wonder what happened. It took about 5 minutes for that to become a link.
[2018-07-19 18:05:39] <MadLittleMods> @bradyt When a GitHub issue link is decorated/abbreviated, clicking it no longer opens the issue, it will instead open a popover that summarizes the issue and you can click a "Open in GitHub" button. Your description around "linking" is a little bit unclear to meYou can see the code here, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/a5cc20cfe8fa2b70e6084064be18bf496ced6a03/public/js/views/chat/decorators/issueDecorator.jsIt was refactored a bit here but that hasn't shipped, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/merge_requests/1077
[2018-07-19 18:51:24] <bradyt> Okay, but popover was dead for about five minutes.
[2018-07-19 18:51:47] <bradyt> So for five minutes, it's strictly worse than a link.
[2018-07-19 18:52:45] <bradyt> And I wouldn't expect anyone to stare at my message for five minutes. It was a short message.
[2018-07-19 18:53:29] <bradyt> Perhaps it should fall back on showing the link.
[2018-07-19 18:53:37] <MadLittleMods> bradyt: So it was decorated, but clicking/hovering didn't bring up the popover? If it happens again, please check if there are any errors in the devtools console or a long-running request in the network tab
[2018-07-19 18:54:55] <bradyt> Decorated? Do you mean was link replaced with short text, or do you mean was it highlighted blue, green, etc like a hyperlink?
[2018-07-19 18:55:40] <bradyt> I don't know when it will happen again, why not just have it degrade gracefully?
[2018-07-19 18:56:50] <bradyt> It was still shortened from original link, but looked like plain text, no highlighting.
[2018-07-19 18:57:10] <bradyt> No hover.
[2018-07-19 18:58:02] <MadLittleMods> bradyt:  [<-LINK->] -> [<-LINK->] updates things to gracefully use a a link instead of span
[2018-07-19 18:58:38] <MadLittleMods> I'll put some more focus on getting that merged in the next few weeks
[2018-07-19 18:59:38] <MadLittleMods> It looks like currently we transform the link to a<span>which only works if the JS kicks in and the request comes back. In the MR linked just above, it is a link<a>at all times
[2018-07-19 19:09:45] <bradyt> I don't think I understand the code. It sounds like you understood my issue at least as well as I do, and are taking it seriously, I very much appreciate that.
[2018-07-22 08:48:56] <spease> I take it notification filtering is also broken on mobile as well? Given that I’ve set it to announcements and mentions in all the rooms and I’m still seeing Gitter contribute to the red counter on the icon for every chat room I’m in.
[2018-07-22 14:51:48] <MadLittleMods> spease: I assume this is iOS? It may be the same sort of problem, the red counter shows unreads
[2018-07-24 13:30:02] <Avamander> Just wanted to ask, is there a way to get gitter rooms into bitlbee?
[2018-07-24 13:30:18] <Avamander> Are there any libpurple integrations maybe?
[2018-07-24 14:13:52] <MadLittleMods> Avamander: You could setup the IRC bridge, [<-LINK->] and use IRC with libpurple/pidgin
[2018-07-24 14:14:21] <Avamander> MadLittleMods: Oh, thanks!
[2018-07-25 22:15:53] <dmeltzer> I've been seeing a lot of notifications on connecting of "realtime socket disconnected' or something like that.. is this a new thing?
[2018-07-25 22:16:04] <dmeltzer> Related question: Is there a way to search backlog of a channel? :)
[2018-07-26 00:56:17] <MadLittleMods> @dmeltzer I assume you mean "Realtime communications with the server have been disconnected". It's not new and probably means that your GitHub token  doesn't work. Next time it happens and the alert pops, open the devtools and look for an error message "Access denied ...".Are you revoking the GitHub scopes? Is there anything in particular that you are doing and it consistently happens?
[2018-07-26 00:56:52] <MadLittleMods> dmeltzer: You can search messages in the current room with the magnifying glass item in the left menu. There is also an "Archives" option in the room settings dropdown in the top-right
[2018-07-26 01:51:48] <dmeltzer> I've done nothing explicitly
[2018-07-26 01:52:04] <dmeltzer> Will look at Dev tools the next time I see it
[2018-07-26 05:02:46] <aKesav> is there any possibility to download gitter archives?
[2018-07-26 05:03:24] <MadLittleMods> aKesav: You can use the developer API to fetch all of the messages in a room, [<-LINK->] (usebeforeIdand paginate 100 messages at a time)
[2018-07-26 05:07:56] <MadLittleMods> aKesav: Also see [<-LINK->]

[2018-08-05 08:37:52] <mittalyashu77_twitter> Can we make a community private?
[2018-08-05 08:40:04] <mittalyashu77_twitter> MadLittleMods: What about push notifications for browser?
[2018-08-05 08:42:18] <MadLittleMods> @mittalyashu77_twitter Communities are public but you can create all private rooms.You can enable offline push notifications for the browser here, http://next.gitter.im/

[2018-08-05 08:49:18] <mittalyashu77_twitter> When we click on reply button, why does it mention the person, instead of appending the message as quotes.
[2018-08-05 08:50:31] <nafg> message actions can definitely use some cleanup, there are  bunch of things you can do but there's ambiguity and insufficient discoverability

[2018-08-05 08:56:09] <nafg> moderation is another thing gitter could solve, although so far I haven't seen it get to the point of ruining a room

[2018-08-07 19:55:59] <amkdp_gitlab> How can I find a room?
[2018-08-07 20:12:40] <MadLittleMods> @amkdp_gitlab You can use magnifying glass in the left menu, menu bar to search for rooms and messages in the current room
[2018-08-07 20:13:56] <amkdp_gitlab> yes I clicked on a room in explore more and searched the site!!! I don't know why there isn't a search in the landing page
[2018-08-07 20:15:12] <MadLittleMods> amkdp_gitlab: Search is auto selected when you visit the explore page but only when signed in
[2018-08-07 20:15:41] <MadLittleMods> amkdp_gitlab: You can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2018-08-08 19:40:10] <MadLittleMods> Gitter 19.15.0 deployed to production, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#19150-2018-8-8Embeds are now behind a feature toggle and disabled by default. They were a bit too disruptive and large in their current form
[2018-08-08 20:51:01] <MadLittleMods> The Gitter Android app is now open-source , https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-android-app. Merge requests welcome!cc @mittalyashu77_twitter @terrysahaidak @Cubxity @TheDiamondYT1 @InternetUnexplorer @charafau @sudhirkhanger @arapuru  as you showed some interest before
[2018-08-08 21:05:04] <InternetUnexplorer> MadLittleMods:  thanks for releasing the source!
[2018-08-08 21:27:35] <lukeeey> Finally!
[2018-08-08 21:28:03] <lukeeey> 
[2018-08-08 21:29:37] <lukeeey> Just a random question, does Gitter have a Discord server?@MadLittleMods
[2018-08-08 21:31:37] <MadLittleMods> lukeeey: Nope 
[2018-08-08 21:36:53] <lukeeey> Oof
[2018-08-08 21:36:56] <lukeeey> would be nice if you did
[2018-08-08 21:37:16] <lukeeey> Oh wait they are a competitor
[2018-08-08 21:38:30] <lukeeey> I dont really use gitter anymore because Discord has a dark theme and an amazing Android app and it has roles
[2018-08-09 05:11:37] <mittalyashu77_twitter> MadLittleMods: awesome
[2018-08-09 05:16:06] <mittalyashu77_twitter> MadLittleMods: Do only work on this Gitter project?
[2018-08-09 05:17:30] <MadLittleMods> mittalyashu77_twitter: Generally yes
[2018-08-09 05:19:09] <mittalyashu77_twitter> That's so much of work to do. Isn't
[2018-08-09 10:13:21] <markgdawson> Hi, is there a way to change the my gitter IRC token (i.e. password)? I may have accidentally shared it....
[2018-08-09 11:08:02] <charafau> MadLittleMods: that's great!
[2018-08-09 11:41:10] <charafau> MadLittleMods: I'm grabbing this one [<-ISSUE->] 
[2018-08-09 12:28:07] <lukeeey> Lmao
[2018-08-09 12:28:19] <lukeeey> Gitter opens that link in github not gitlab ^
[2018-08-09 12:28:37] <lukeeey> Is gitter still popular?
[2018-08-09 12:29:46] <cbj4074> Not for me. Or if it does, it's redirected tohttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-android-app/issues/58.
[2018-08-09 12:30:10] <cbj4074> Hates gon' hate
[2018-08-09 12:30:36] <lukeeey> It cant redirct though...
[2018-08-09 12:30:57] <lukeeey> Maybe since i'm using the Android app it links everything to github
[2018-08-09 12:31:39] <lukeeey> I think i'd like gitter more if at least the android apps werent just webviews because the chat doesnt persist well so it makes it a pain to talk
[2018-08-09 12:33:05] <lukeeey> Discord did it perfectly - anything on the desktop is a webview but the mobile apps are completely native and well designed
[2018-08-09 12:33:39] <cbj4074> Ahh, hehe, that may very well be the case, re: on Android. That may very well be a bug. Well, the good news is that the Android mobile app was open-sourced yesterday
[2018-08-09 12:34:17] <cbj4074> So, you can jump in and start wrenching-around for a fix
[2018-08-09 12:34:38] <lukeeey> I'd be playing with webviews and i dont like playing with webviews
[2018-08-09 12:34:49] <cbj4074> And I concur, I don't like the webview approach, either
[2018-08-09 12:35:08] <cbj4074> I wonder if there's any push for a native implementation, or if it's even a consideration
[2018-08-09 12:35:12] <lukeeey> You never know,@MadLittleModsmight let us change it
[2018-08-09 12:35:28] <cbj4074> Indeed, curious to hear his thoughts here
[2018-08-09 12:35:29] <lukeeey> If someone can produce a good enough pull request then i dont see the problem
[2018-08-09 12:38:05] <charafau> yep, seems like a bug
[2018-08-09 12:38:17] <lukeeey> How is it a bug?
[2018-08-09 12:41:15] <charafau> it works on desktop but not on mobile
[2018-08-09 12:41:36] <charafau> seems like Room fragment is webview :(
[2018-08-09 12:42:19] <lukeeey> I'm gonna try and build the app
[2018-08-09 12:42:35] <lukeeey> I barely use gitlab though its too responsive for my liking
[2018-08-09 12:44:03] <charafau> it's pretty small app
[2018-08-09 12:45:07] <lukeeey> I have no idea what to add to the app
[2018-08-09 12:45:59] <charafau>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-08-09 12:47:10] <charafau>  [<-LINK->] this is probably where it should be fixed
[2018-08-09 12:52:12] <lukeeey>  [<-CODE->] This code is useless...
[2018-08-09 15:00:44] <MarkusTiede> Hi all
[2018-08-09 15:02:48] <MarkusTiede> I'm having issues creating a new "community" in gitter - can someone help? I already created a few and this time it's not working and I can't tell why.
[2018-08-09 15:24:49] <rodrigoswz> Hi, can I request a little feature? It's just a adaptive icon for the Android app
[2018-08-09 17:40:41] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @M4rkDI have deleted your IRC token. Visit [<-LINK->] to regenerate your token
[2018-08-09 17:43:33] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @MarkusTiedeWhat community are you trying to create (URI)? Are you associating it with some GitHub org/repo? What error are you running into or how is it not working?
[2018-08-09 17:44:20] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @rodrigoswzPlease create an issue with some more details, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-08-09 17:46:52] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @lukeeeyPlease create an issue about GitLab decorated links opening in GitHub, [<-LINK->] . We may just need to release a new version with updated JavaScript
[2018-08-09 17:53:09] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @cbj4074@lukeeeyWe are focused on webapp. There isn't any push to add any features to the Android/iOS but we are happy to review community merge requests. Going completely native may be fine. One thing of note is markdown messages which are rendered to HTML and would probably be best rendered in a webview
[2018-08-09 21:13:10] <lukeeey> MadLittleMods: i havent actually updated the app yet so i'll see if it works when updated
[2018-08-10 02:23:48] <charafau> MadLittleMods: is there anyway to switch theme for room chat from mobile webapp ?
[2018-08-10 02:23:54] <charafau> like magic js function ?
[2018-08-10 02:24:11] <charafau> if not, can we add this ?
[2018-08-10 10:57:38] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @charafauAs a workaround, you can use the mobile browser request desktop site option and use the same "Toggle Dark Theme" option as in the normal desktop browser
[2018-08-10 10:58:41] <charafau> MadLittleMods: I will upgrade everything but that room chat (I'm mostly done, need to change 3 icon colors) and make MR
[2018-08-10 10:58:56] <charafau> and then let's discuss available options in MR itself
[2018-08-10 11:01:37] <MadLittleMods> @charafau Are you referring to the Android app? There currently isn't a dark theme option.With the current webapp, the dark theme is toggled by just including a stylesheet, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/fd9178f8c578f972b7c46df149387a5a5a192e24/public/js/utils/toggle-dark-theme.js. We will need to pack the dark-theme CSS into the Android styles assets to toggle
[2018-08-10 11:04:36] <charafau> MadLittleMods: yes to android app. I know there's not dark theme option but I added it ;) the only thing left are dark icons and changing that css for chat

[2018-08-10 17:41:34] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @charafauLooks nice!
[2018-08-11 20:52:43] <markgdawson> MadLittleMods: , Apologies for the late reply Eric. Thanks for deleting the token.
[2018-08-11 22:10:32] <lukeeey> MadLittleMods: You should add a repo description for the android app
[2018-08-12 21:00:33] <earnie> Just installed the Windows app but find that when I close the UI the 4 background process continue to run which wouldn't have been an issue except that the GUI doesn't restart when I click the application icon.  Before asking this question here I tried to search for any information but there isn't a search facility present. :(
[2018-08-12 21:01:38] <MadLittleMods> earnie: When you exit the main window, Gitter keeps running in the background. You can restore it from the tray icon in the bottom-right. Desktop issues are tracked here [<-LINK->] 
[2018-08-12 21:02:19] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @lukeeeyAdded a basic description. Suggestions welcome
[2018-08-12 21:02:37] <earnie> MadLittleMods: I looked for that in the icon tray first thing but no such luck.
[2018-08-12 21:04:18] <MadLittleMods> earnie: You can [<-LINK->] or use the remote debugger(start the app with [<-CODE->] and visit [<-LINK->] to possibly see what went wrong
[2018-08-12 21:05:01] <earnie> Okay, thanks. Will give that a try.
[2018-08-13 01:21:12] <charafau> MadLittleMods: does this pipeline always fail ?gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-android-app!2

[2018-08-13 17:53:18] <DanielS30789596_twitter> do you have experience in ruby on rails?
[2018-08-13 17:54:21] <MadLittleMods> DanielS30789596_twitter: This room is for Gitter support, not general technical support.  You already tried asking your question in [<-LINK->] but never asked an actual question. Please stop. Don't ask to ask, just ask your question
[2018-08-13 17:54:43] <mittalyashu77_twitter> DanielS30789596_twitter: you can try asking in rails community: [<-LINK->] 
[2018-08-13 18:00:38] <DanielS30789596_twitter> very good thanks...
[2018-08-14 05:01:01] <MadLittleMods> scoobydoogangster: This room is for Gitter support, not general technical support. Please read the room topic/description at the top and the welcome message when joining a room. You can try asking your question in [<-LINK->] 
[2018-08-14 11:51:52] <charafau> MadLittleMods: should I use this channel for android app development (for contacting devs) or move todeveloperschannel?

[2018-08-14 13:57:27] <charafau> thanks
[2018-08-14 22:14:47] <mklatsky> Good afternoon- I've used Gitter off and on for about 2 years. I haven't used it in awhile, so I just installed the OSX desktop app. However, the fonts look terrible. Is there a way to change the fonts in the app? I am on High Sierra. Thanks!
[2018-08-14 22:37:41] <MadLittleMods> @mklatsky There haven't been other reports of this . Can you provide a screenshot for reference?You can also try the unsigned v4.1.0 app (uses NW.js), http://update.gitter.im/osx/Gitter-4.1.0.dmg
[2018-08-14 23:00:37] <mapukhakis_twitter> MadLittleMods: Where would you like me to provide the screenshot?
[2018-08-14 23:01:00] <mapukhakis_twitter> Also I’ll try the linked file
[2018-08-14 23:27:32] <MadLittleMods> mapukhakis_twitter: You can link the screenshot here or drag and drop it onto the chat area to upload it
[2018-08-14 23:28:15] <mapukhakis_twitter>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-08-14 23:29:03] <mapukhakis_twitter> Hopefully you can see the font issue I describe.
[2018-08-14 23:30:10] <MadLittleMods> @mapukhakis_twitter Does the sidebar also have the same jaggies? Seems like it might be a DPI detection issue.Did you try out the v4.1.0 of the app?
[2018-08-14 23:30:31] <mapukhakis_twitter> sidebar looks ok.
[2018-08-14 23:30:46] <mapukhakis_twitter> I did not try 4.1.0 yet as I didn’t want to muddy the watter.
[2018-08-14 23:30:54] <mapukhakis_twitter> I can go ahead and install now.
[2018-08-14 23:31:17] <mapukhakis_twitter> I’ll be right back
[2018-08-14 23:31:28] <MadLittleMods> mapukhakis_twitter: There aren't any plans really to update the v1.x of the app (uses Safari) so if it can't be fixed on your end, v4.1.0 would be your best bet
[2018-08-14 23:32:58] <mklatsky> Ok- just upgraded.
[2018-08-14 23:33:28] <mklatsky> The font issue is still there. The left and right side panels both look fine though.
[2018-08-14 23:35:26] <MadLittleMods> mklatsky: The right sidebar being fine is a little interesting as it is inside the same iframe as the chat. I was thinking it was a problem with any content in the iframe
[2018-08-14 23:36:18] <MadLittleMods> mklatsky: Just to make sure, when you look at the desktop version, it is actually v4?
[2018-08-14 23:36:36] <mklatsky> yes- checked the About to make sure.
[2018-08-14 23:36:55] <mklatsky> To be sure- the font in the center is better.
[2018-08-14 23:37:01] <mklatsky> much better.
[2018-08-14 23:37:14] <MadLittleMods> mklatsky: Can you screenshot the whole app with v4?
[2018-08-14 23:37:22] <mklatsky> sure
[2018-08-14 23:38:06] <mklatsky>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-08-14 23:38:06] <MadLittleMods> mklatsky: You can see a reference image of what it looks like for me here (with macOS 10.12.6), [<-LINK->] 
[2018-08-14 23:39:25] <mklatsky> Well- checked a few other channels- and where the font before was almost unreadable- it actually looks pretty good now.
[2018-08-14 23:39:40] <MadLittleMods> mklatsky: What kind of macOS device are you on? What screen resolution and density?
[2018-08-14 23:40:23] <mklatsky> 2017 MBP w/Retina, touchbar
[2018-08-14 23:43:09] <MadLittleMods> mklatsky: Does the font look the same in the Chrome browser as in the desktop app?
[2018-08-14 23:44:28] <mklatsky> Yes- it does.
[2018-08-14 23:45:17] <MadLittleMods> mklatsky: Thanks, that would be expected behavior then. Although if there is something to adjust and improve the clarity (probably CSS), merge request welcome, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-08-14 23:46:29] <mklatsky> Sure enough. To be sure- this version is miles better than the 1.x version.
[2018-08-14 23:46:34] <mklatsky> I appreciate your time!
[2018-08-14 23:46:58] <MadLittleMods> You're welcome  Glad you got something usable now!
[2018-08-14 23:47:00] <mklatsky> Also digging the irc bridge- so many clients :)
[2018-08-16 03:13:15] <ArtSebus> hi is there any support for slack like attachment button s?
[2018-08-16 05:26:06] <MadLittleMods> ArtSebus: You can drag and drop a file onto the chat area to upload it. You can track [<-ISSUE->] for an upload button in the UI
[2018-08-16 13:56:36] <dkzhaohe> MadLittleMods: cool
[2018-08-16 19:52:39] <TallTed> MadLittleMods: - Is there a way to "go to date"? The stupid "n unread" link at the top doesn't show the actual count, and doesn't bring me back to where I really last read (Aug 7) in one of my rooms.  Scrolling back page-by-page isn't working either. (I'm running Gitter.app Version 4.1.0 (4.1.0) on macOS 10.10.)
[2018-08-16 19:58:14] <MadLittleMods> TallTed: You can pick a date in the archives, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-08-16 19:59:56] <TallTed> MadLittleMods: and Archives force you into the browser...  which is already way overloaded. (it isn't, shouldn't be, and will never be my only app!)
[2018-08-16 20:02:16] <MadLittleMods> TallTed: It seems like what you would actually be in favor of is this [<-ISSUE->] 
[2018-08-16 20:02:59] <TallTed> MadLittleMods: and of all the stupid UI...  "colored date boxes" without actual dates shown, except via mouseover tooltip?  and with weeks going top-to-bottom insteda of the standard calendar left-to-right?  plus you're using my whole browser window for this interface, why make the nav system SO TINY with virtually no useful info?  reinventing EVERY WHEEL is a terrible way to build a machine.
[2018-08-16 20:03:28] <TallTed> yes, issue 1504 is closely related.
[2018-08-16 20:07:52] <MadLittleMods> TallTed: The heatmap is pretty common to show activity for git contributions (GitLab/GitHub). There are definitely improvements to be made thoughgitlab-org/gitter/webapp#920
gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#785
gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1699
[2018-08-16 20:09:15] <TallTed> MadLittleMods: - Important to remember that these aren't git contributions.  This is a chat system.  It's vaguely useful to know that a day had a lot of activity, but it's far from the most important detail on an archives navigator!
[2018-08-16 20:09:45] <MadLittleMods> TallTed: Do you have some examples of a better interface you like?
[2018-08-16 20:12:05] <TallTed> MadLittleMods: - I would not be using this chat tool by choice. I'm forced into it by projects with which I must interact.A calendar-focused interface should conform to the common calendar format -- showing dates throughout, and generally running weeks L-to-R.
[2018-08-16 20:12:39] <TallTed> Addinghints about activity level is reasonable, but not at the cost of the basic date detail.
[2018-08-16 20:13:53] <TallTed> (a totally random thing, just noticed...   "Your suggestions" should be "Suggestions for you", because they're not "my suggestions" [which I would have made].)
[2018-08-16 20:14:01] <MadLittleMods> @TallTed I think this could be improved by gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#920 and some non-native tooltips that appear right away similar to https://gitlab.com/MadLittleModsMaking the squares bigger would also be good
[2018-08-16 20:14:48] <MadLittleMods> The Monday->Sunday vertical format is standard for the heatmap which is what is currently in place.If you have an example of a better archive format, I'm curious to explore
[2018-08-16 20:36:40] <MadLittleMods> Gitter 19.16.0 deployed to production, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-08-16 20:51:03] <TallTed> @MadLittleMods - https://news.livejournal.com/2004/ is not terrible.https://sourceforge.net/p/virtuoso/mailman/virtuoso-users/ has much to be said for it (though it also has issues).https://web.archive.org/web/*/www.openlinksw.com is quite good.I don't think you'll find heatmaps (and even less so vertical weeks) common on archival presentations much of anywhere that activity levels aren't significant to the information being navigated somehow... which significance is questionable on code repositories, even if it is some measure of a project's popularity or a contributor's productivity. Using heatmaps for gitter archives seems a lot more like "hey, look at this cool toy I found!" than "hey, here's the best possible way to present the data we're working with!"
[2018-08-16 20:52:48] <MadLittleMods> TallTed: Since it has it's own page, a full calendar is pretty fine. If you are interested in creating a merge request, [<-LINK->] and I can add some relevant code links
[2018-08-16 21:17:06] <TallTed> MadLittleMods: - I'll try to find the time to great an issue. I doubt I can contribute usefully to an MR/PR on this one.
[2018-08-16 21:18:10] <TallTed> MadLittleMods: - separately...  reading through archives, you don't get emoticons, you just get their text, so for instance what's   here shows up there as
[2018-08-19 03:08:36] <nanohard> Hey there. So... I can't figure out how to create a room linked to a Github public repo. I searched the docs. I have OAuth enabled for Gitter on my user account.  When trying to create the room it mentions something about an "org". I don't have an org. Is it necessary to create an organization on Github first, just to link one repo to one room?
[2018-08-19 03:21:39] <MadLittleMods> @nanohard Can you link the repo you want to create a room for? [<-CODE->] 
[2018-08-19 03:31:53] <nanohard> Instead of "creating a community" on the startup page I'm just trying to create the room based on a github repo. The repo appears in the list, but then I get the above error message when I try to create the room. The repo is at [<-LINK->] 
[2018-08-19 03:33:13] <nanohard> Ah, so Gitter actually depends on organizations?
[2018-08-19 03:34:38] <MadLittleMods> @nanohard No, you can create a community that is backed by nothing, a repo, or an organisation. [<-CODE->] 
[2018-08-19 03:34:54] <nanohard> Thanks
[2018-08-19 17:34:41] <mrmajik45> you ok there bobo?
[2018-08-20 11:41:36] <blabla1337> Hi Guys / @MadLittleModsI have a weird problem, I accidentally removed my chatroom a while ago and lost the users and integration tools. Now I created the room again and added all the users but I cannot get the integration tooling to work anymore. With all the tools I want to add I get the bad request error...? How can I solve this issue? I already removed all the web hooks and stuff but I keep getting the error and not able to add the integration tools anymore
[2018-08-20 12:22:00] <blabla1337> Hmm got it partially fixed but all manual, keep getting the weird bad request errors but at least its generating a token again from gitter.im
[2018-08-20 14:56:32] <MadLittleMods> @blabla1337 I can also reproduce with a couple other integrations. It happens after clicking the "GitHub" button in the integration modal.It looks like this is already tracked by gitlab-org/gitter/services#100 but I missed it earlier in the week. I'll look into it now
[2018-08-20 16:00:59] <MadLittleMods> blabla1337:  [<-ISSUE->] should be resolved now
[2018-08-20 17:14:24] <MadLittleMods> Gitter 19.17.0 deployed to production, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#19170-2018-8-20Now with chat message reporting (community moderation), https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/messages.md#report-messages

[2018-08-21 01:09:58] <seanradley> Hi. I need help with deleting my gitter community. Who do I ask?
[2018-08-21 01:11:01] <seanradley> MadLittleMods: 
[2018-08-21 01:27:02] <MadLittleMods> seanradley:  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-08-21 03:14:43] <seanradley> Thank you, sir!
[2018-08-21 10:50:19] <blabla1337> MadLittleMods: Thanks for the response I will try it again ! :)
[2018-08-22 07:02:05] <mittalyashu77_twitter> Feature request:When we edit the message and try to mention someone there the suggested list doesn't show up.
[2018-08-22 15:33:27] <MadLittleMods> mittalyashu77_twitter: It's related to [<-ISSUE->] but please create a separate issue to track this feature
[2018-08-22 18:12:13] <LemonAndroid> MadLittleMods: Hey, I would like to help, any issue I may focus on? [<-LINK->] 
[2018-08-23 10:36:02] <LemonAndroid> Also: is anyone monitoring the gitlab gitter? All questions in the last few days have ben left unanswered.
[2018-08-23 18:59:18] <InternetUnexplorer> LemonAndroid: IIRC,@MadLittleModshas been traveling to the GitLab summit, and so he hasn't been able to be very active for the past few days.
[2018-08-23 22:22:37] <MadLittleMods>  August 22, 2018 1:12 PM @LemonAndroid You can tackle any issue of interest. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues?label_name%5B%5D=Accepting+Merge+Requests has some good starters.As @InternetUnexplorer mentioned, I was traveling the past couple days to the GitLab summit in South Africa
[2018-08-23 23:02:13] <LemonAndroid> You are also responsible for the gitlab/gitlabhq channel?
[2018-08-24 00:47:23] <InternetUnexplorer> LemonAndroid: If you're asking about@MadLittleMods, he works for GitLab (who owns Gitter), and seems to be the current maintainer, based on the recent activity in the webapp repo.If you're asking about me, I've been granted admin access to some of thegitterHQrooms to help fight spam, but I don't work for GitLab. I'm just a community member :slight_smile:.
[2018-08-24 01:49:22] <pdurbin> Picking up from [<-LINK->] ... I was wondering if there are any other installations of Gitter other than the main one. It sounds like not, which is sad because I really like Gitter, especially for open source. Great transparency.
[2018-08-24 19:53:52] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @LemonAndroidSorry for the confusion. I don't frequent [<-LINK->] but do keep a close eye on thegitterHQrooms. The few other GitLabbers who sometimes hang in that room are probably also at the summit so responses will be lacking until everyone gets back to normal
[2018-08-24 19:55:48] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @pdurbinYou can have your own self-hosted Dockerized development Gitter, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-08-24 20:17:51] <pdurbin> MadLittleMods: thanks! Any thanks for merging my pull request! I was worried you wouldn't because the tests weren't passing: [<-LINK->] 
[2018-08-24 20:21:32] <MadLittleMods> @pdurbin Thanks for the contribution I tested it locally. The pipeline will always fail for forks unless you add a bunch of CI variables/secrets in your forked project.  There isn't a way for me to run a manual pipeline using the upstream project variables so it's not very ideal. I could push your branch to the main project if I wanted to double-check the pipeline
[2018-08-24 21:21:11] <pdurbin> Ah. I'm glad you tested it because I didn't. :) I brought my work laptop home this weekend because it's more capable of running the Dockerized thing you linked to. It's confusing and a little scary for new contributors to see tests failing but you probably know that already.
[2018-08-25 04:50:46] <bjorno43> Not sure if this is the place to ask, but I'm having a small problem. I was testing a bot in our bot testing room. Due to a stupid mistake (I made to bot send a respond to any message in the room, not realising it would respond to its own messages), I think it got blocked due to spamming. It can still read messages, just not send anything. Is there a way to fix this?
[2018-08-25 21:29:46] <MadLittleMods> bjorno43: What is the username for the bot? I can check and unban it
[2018-08-25 21:39:27] <pdurbin> MadLittleMods: thanks for replying to the issue I opened. I just posted another comment after running the. .envstep. I'm still having trouble, unfortunately.
[2018-08-25 21:51:05] <MadLittleMods> pdurbin:  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-08-25 21:58:44] <pdurbin> Thanks, I replied again. Is this more on topic over at [<-LINK->] ?
[2018-08-25 22:01:54] <MadLittleMods> pdurbin: Yes . I would have pointed you over there if this continued for a longer period
[2018-08-25 22:06:09] <pdurbin> It's continuing so I'll post over there next. :)
[2018-08-25 22:14:05] <bjorno43> MadLittleMods: The username of the bot is "bobsbot" :)
[2018-08-25 23:00:19] <MadLittleMods> bjorno43: bobsbothas been unbanned. You can still run into the same spam detection though (vary up the messages when testing)
[2018-08-25 23:01:03] <bjorno43> MadLittleMods: Thanks. I've already solved those issues with the bot :)
[2018-08-27 12:21:17] <bjorno43> MadLittleMods: Could you tell me how to properly add a newline in a message sent with the API? I can do it with my code by simply hard coding a new line in the string, provided I'm not using any code indentation. Otherwise it'll include the tabs (spaces) in the message. I've tried\nbut that doesn't seem to work.
[2018-08-27 12:23:27] <pdurbin> Where in your code would you add the newline?
[2018-08-27 12:26:54] <bjorno43> Well lets say for example that a user requests info from a bot by sending the command "help" to it. The bot would return a message like:The following functions are available:Provide JS code to run it
Request challengeEtc etc. In these situations a newline is needed or it would return something like: The following functions are available: - Provide JS code to run it - Request challenge
[2018-08-27 12:37:07] <bjorno43> pdurbin: So in my code that basicly translates to: [<-CODE->] 
[2018-08-27 12:54:58] <pdurbin> And you said adding "\n" doesn't work? What about two newlines? In Markdown you need verical space before a list. So you could try "available:\n\n". And I assume you'd need a newline after the first bullet, the first list itme.
[2018-08-27 12:57:20] <bjorno43> pdurbin: No the problem is that \n is processed like a literal string. You can see it yourself in your message. It just adds \n to your message instead of processing it as a newline.
[2018-08-27 13:01:37] <bjorno43> Which kinda makes sense in a way. Obviously you don't want user input to influence the way a message is processed. And I assume that a message from a bot is treated no differently. Unless it's actually \r\n in which case this should be on a new line.
[2018-08-27 13:16:44] <pdurbin> Ok. Can you manually construct a message that looks the way you want by typing it yourself? In this room or wherever you're testing?
[2018-08-27 13:26:55] <bjorno43> pdurbin: Sure. This would be one of the messages the bot returns:
[2018-08-27 13:27:09] <bjorno43>  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] Current limitations:I can only output 1 result at a time. (Don't output results in a loop as it will only return the last loop)
My time limit is set to 10 seconds. Scripts taking more time will be killed
My memory limit is set to 10 MegaBytes. Scripts taking more memory will be killed
[2018-08-27 13:28:45] <pdurbin> Gotcha. yeah, looks fine. Hmm.
[2018-08-27 13:31:20] <bjorno43> As I said, it works perfectly fine if I would do something like this: [<-CODE->] In this case the new line is hard coded into the string and recognised by Gitter. But if I were to use any code indentation there, the second line would include the indentation
[2018-08-27 13:33:18] <bjorno43> As for functionality it doesn't really matter. It works. But it becomes a problem when I can't hard code the string because I'm retrieving it from a database instead.
[2018-08-27 13:34:29] <pdurbin> Gotcha. Do you have a dev environment set up?
[2018-08-27 13:35:11] <bjorno43> I do. Though obviously I'm using our bot test room on Gitter to actually test it
[2018-08-27 13:35:28] <MadLittleMods> bjorno43: This question is better suited for the API room,  [<-LINK->] . Let's continue there
[2018-08-27 13:35:40] <bjorno43> MadLittleMods: Sure :)
[2018-08-27 16:50:34] <halirutan> Hey guys. This might be borderline on-topic here, but maybe someone can say if this is a known issue. We have a room for an GitHub organization [<-LINK->] . However, I don't understand why I cannot set specific repository integrations. I was the one who created this room and I'm admin on our organization. Still, the settings panel inside Gitter looks like this
[2018-08-27 16:50:49] <halirutan> 
[2018-08-27 16:51:05] <halirutan> No Integrations there. Why is that?
[2018-08-27 20:32:29] <nparis_gitlab> I need someone to contact me regarding my team's account. I just purchased 14 licenses and needed to choose the enterprise "bronze" package but wound up selecting "self-managed" and need to change. Can someone from Gitlab Sales or Helpdesk please reach out atnparis@tccm.orgto assist me?
[2018-08-27 21:43:58] <TallTed> nparis_gitlab: - This channel is about gitter tech issues... I think you need a different room for your gitlab question.
[2018-08-28 02:39:29] <rostrander_gitlab> nparis_gitlab: You probably want to contactsupport@gitlab.com- turnaround may be a bit higher right now because most people are at summit, but that's the likely point of contact
[2018-08-28 08:24:25] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @halirutanSee [<-LINK->] (same applies to whether we see you as an admin)
[2018-08-28 09:30:40] <antonlva> hi everybody! is it known issue when one constantly getting "Validation failed" error while creating private room based on private GH repo?any ideas how to fix it?
[2018-08-28 10:15:28] <antonlva> hmm, figured it out. I created a repo named with one letter, renaming it to longer name helpedbut it's kind of bug, isnt't it?
[2018-08-29 17:09:25] <mittalyashu77_twitter> MadLittleMods: can you set a profile picture on my account?
[2018-08-30 09:15:14] <qianyongwan> Git lab does not differentiate backup？
[2018-08-31 07:08:46] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @antonlvaIt looks like the minimum room name length is 2. The relevant code is here [<-LINK->] 
[2018-08-31 07:12:41] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @mittalyashu77_twitterI have updated your avatar. Docs for reference, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-08-31 07:13:32] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @qianyongwanCan you explain your question more? This room is for Gitter support (the chat app itself). If you are looking for some GitLab help, see [<-LINK->] 
[2018-08-31 10:05:55] <LemonAndroid> Have you thought about adding the possibility of adding irc channels?
[2018-08-31 11:40:27] <LemonAndroid> i know about the irc-bridge
[2018-08-31 11:40:31] <LemonAndroid> but that's not what i mean
[2018-08-31 15:37:51] <MadLittleMods> @LemonAndroid You can track gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#662People accomplish this today with a bot user,https://sameroom.io/open-a-tube (guide: https://sameroom.io/blog/how-to-bridge-existing-irc-channels-and-rooms-on-gitter or https://sameroom.io/integrations/connect-irc-and-gitter)
https://github.com/finnp/gitter-irc-bot
https://github.com/mrexodia/gogitterirc
[2018-08-31 16:41:16] <LemonAndroid> are threads like in slack planned?
[2018-08-31 16:42:39] <LemonAndroid> It should also be transparent who deleted a message
[2018-08-31 16:42:56] <LemonAndroid> maybe as an opt-in configuration setting
[2018-08-31 16:43:01] <LemonAndroid> so it's not cluttering by default
[2018-08-31 16:44:48] <LemonAndroid> and emote reactions
[2018-08-31 16:45:07] <LemonAndroid> it's probably boring to hear these feature requests for stuff that's already implemented in discord/slack
[2018-09-01 08:38:26] <zaneselvans> I'm an admin of a GitHub organization, and I'm attempting to create a public gitter chat for one of our public repositories: https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudlHowever, the organizational authorization failed for some reason during my initial signup with Gitter -- I attempted to grant access, but it just hung indefinitely, and eventually I navigated away from the page, potentially leaving it in some limbo state.I've looked through the docs, and am now attempting to manually grant Gitter access to our organization from within my personal application settings, as described here:https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/oauth-scopes.mdHowever, when I click "grant" next to Catalyst Cooperative on the Gitter Public Repo Access page, it has no effect -- the button turns into a circle briefly, and then turns back into a grant button. Which seems like an odd behavior.
[2018-09-01 08:41:20] <zaneselvans> And Gitter continues not to have access to our organizational repositories.
[2018-09-01 08:44:03] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @LemonAndroidYou can trackThreads, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#741
Message deleted audit log (create an issue). Sorta related gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1968
Reactions, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#365
[2018-09-01 08:46:01] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @zaneselvansThis seems like a problem on GitHub's side  so it would better to create a support ticket there. You can also see if you can grant access via [<-LINK->] instead of via your personal settings
[2018-09-01 08:54:36] <zaneselvans> Ahh, even more strangely, the Gitter application is listed there as having successfully been granted access to the organization. I'll try revoking and re-granting permission.
[2018-09-01 11:21:44] <zaneselvans> Thankfully this worked!
[2018-09-01 14:49:09] <plandes> Noob question: I have just created a community for my github repo.  Unfortunately I didn't associate with my repo.  I don't see how to tie it to my repo and it also doesn't seem to allow me to delete the community so I can recreate with association to the repo.  This is confounding :(
[2018-09-01 14:52:19] <plandes> The gitter channel community is "zotsite"
[2018-09-01 16:00:32] <plandes> I've created a new community, room and added integration but there is no "Open in GitHub": [<-LINK->] 
[2018-09-01 16:50:18] <MadLittleMods> @plandesSome docs around deleting a community, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/communities.md#delete-a-communityhttp://gitter.im/zotsite is associated with nothing
https://gitter.im/zoterosite is associated with https://github.com/plandes/zotsite
https://gitter.im/zoterosite/zotsite inherits the group permissions but we currently don't follow the permissions for the GitHub link, see gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1955 [<-CODE->] 
[2018-09-01 18:46:58] <plandes> Ah, I see the problem, I haven't created an organization so there is a relationship from a community to a GitHub organization. Is this correct?
[2018-09-01 18:48:39] <plandes> If I create a zotsite organization and create a community from the organization then I can create rooms based on repos, which in turn provides the "Open in GithHub" link?
[2018-09-01 21:10:57] <begriffs> Hey there, how can I rename my community? It's begriffs/postgrest but now that we have a github org I'd like it to be postgrest/postgrest
[2018-09-01 23:47:13] <bjorno43> MadLittleMods: Sorry I was testing a code issue with "bobsbotty" and forgot the change the messages returned while doing so. Do you mind unbanning it when you have so time? The issue is resolved. Shouldn't happen again
[2018-09-02 16:22:32] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @plandesYou can create community associated with yourselfplandes, and then create thezotsiteroom associated with the repo [<-LINK->]

[2018-09-02 21:30:44] <plandes> MadLittleMods: While I like the idea of having my own community, it would feel oddly self serving :)
[2018-09-02 21:31:01] <plandes> MadLittleMods: Thank you for your help!
[2018-09-02 23:46:17] <ghost~5af752ded73408ce4f991987> Is there a way of changing the username?
[2018-09-03 00:55:09] <kayabaNerve> I don't need support. I wanted to ask if we can get a :thinking: emoji.
[2018-09-03 00:55:21] <kayabaNerve> I've needed it quite often. Development makes me think :P

[2018-09-03 12:28:42] <davidsiaw> hey id like to ask about some chat room policies
[2018-09-03 12:32:45] <pdurbin> go for it
[2018-09-03 12:33:55] <davidsiaw> is it a thing for chat rooms to be archived and shown on google
[2018-09-03 12:34:12] <pdurbin> that's the default
[2018-09-03 12:34:28] <davidsiaw> thats worrying. i am pretty sure i made mine private but its showing
[2018-09-03 12:34:31] <davidsiaw> i guess ill submit a report
[2018-09-03 12:36:01] <pdurbin> ok
[2018-09-03 12:36:39] <MadLittleMods> @davidsiaw Send an email to support@gitter.im with a link to your room and how you are finding messages on Google please.Also there is a related setting: Room settings dropdown in the top-right -> Archives -> Room indexed by search engines in the bottom-right
[2018-09-03 12:37:50] <davidsiaw> ive deleted my room already. it was never meant to be public
[2018-09-03 12:37:54] <davidsiaw> but it seems like something changed
[2018-09-03 12:38:05] <davidsiaw> and it became public somehow
[2018-09-03 12:39:10] <MadLittleMods> davidsiaw: There is no mechanism to change the room security after creation. I'm still curious on the details just to make sure
[2018-09-03 12:39:38] <davidsiaw> yes you are right, you can only change room security at creation
[2018-09-03 12:39:41] <davidsiaw> and it was private
[2018-09-03 12:39:45] <davidsiaw> and then it became public
[2018-09-03 12:40:03] <davidsiaw> and we started finding messages from it on google
[2018-09-03 12:40:07] <davidsiaw> so that was pretty upsetting
[2018-09-03 12:41:20] <MadLittleMods> davidsiaw: If the room was deleted, there isn't a way to for me to confirm if the room was actually private to begin with 
[2018-09-03 12:42:23] <davidsiaw> oh are you a dev?
[2018-09-03 12:42:37] <MadLittleMods> davidsiaw: Yes
[2018-09-03 12:42:41] <davidsiaw> i was going to say check your database, but i guess you guys dont keep a change log on the db
[2018-09-03 12:43:07] <davidsiaw> if you dont mind we can continue the conversation in private chat
[2018-09-03 12:43:22] <MadLittleMods> davidsiaw: Send an email tosupport@gitter.imwith a link to your room and how you are finding messages on Google please.
[2018-09-03 12:43:41] <davidsiaw> i just sent one but ill reply to it with how to find messages on google
[2018-09-03 20:31:59] <jeremy-hanna> Hi, quick question - is there a way to link my github handle with a gitter URL so that someone could open a chat with me by clicking on it? I haven't quickly figured out a way to do this so figured I'd ask :)
[2018-09-03 20:59:09] <jeremy-hanna> possibly just link something like [<-LINK->] and if it's not my profile it will be the one on one conversation room I'm guessing?
[2018-09-03 22:31:46] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @jeremy-hanna [<-LINK->] is the correct way . For others, it will open a one to one conversation with you
[2018-09-06 02:06:55] <TallTed> @MadLittleMods - A new (to me, and surprisingly irritating) quirk of gitter!  if you make a second (or third or fourth or fifth) post too quickly after the first, the later posts don't get new timestamp... so the alt-click shortcut isn't available, and (more problematic) it's not clear that you made multiple posts, nor once that's figured out is it obvious where one post ends and another begins!This seems likely to be, at least in part, because displayed timestamps are only to the minute -- unlike every other chat tool I've ever used -- so seconds aren't shown and aren't an obvious differentiator ... and may not even be recorded, even if every post has a unique identifier and sequence-order under the covers.
[2018-09-06 07:34:33] <MadLittleMods> TallTed: It's called a burst. Messages sent in a certain amount of time by the same user won't get extra unnecessary info. You can track this issue for having access to permalinks to each message, [<-ISSUE->] 
[2018-09-06 11:27:23] <Oldes>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-09-06 11:27:27] <Oldes> Could you please prevent this to happen?
[2018-09-06 11:44:03] <MadLittleMods> @Oldes Are you using the desktop app? What platform (OS, browser) are you on?It looks like they don't have an avatar but it should be showing the default grey Gitter one
[2018-09-06 11:45:20] <Oldes> Windows, Chrome. And it was said to me, that it is twitter account which cannot have icon or something like that.
[2018-09-06 11:48:28] <Oldes>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-09-06 11:49:09] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] If you open devtools and look at that network request, did it fail?
[2018-09-06 11:50:55] <Oldes> I don't know what you are asking me to do:) To me it is Gitter bug as it should show the gray logo at least.
[2018-09-06 11:51:51] <rebolek> Oldes: devtools in browser would show if the resource was loaded or not
[2018-09-06 11:52:19] <Oldes> Ah.. when I reloaded I see the icon now.
[2018-09-06 13:07:43] <TallTed> MadLittleMods: --   [<-LINK->] "extra unnecessary" is an opinion.  I did send several queued up responses to people,writtenover an hour or so while reading an archive set, anddispatchedover a couple of minutes.  Each message was addressed to different people -- and should have an obvious permalink and separation from the other messages.
[2018-09-10 03:46:00] <ThinkDigitalSoftware> Why is the Gitter app so simple? It needs a better design for mobile...
[2018-09-10 14:11:08] <MadLittleMods> ThinkDigitalRepair: What do you have in mind? mobile browser, iOS, or Android?
[2018-09-10 14:12:24] <ThinkDigitalSoftware> IOS and android. It needs buttons at least. The bottom text input area has none. And no menus for editing sent messages
[2018-09-10 14:13:24] <ThinkDigitalSoftware> I would expect a 3-dot menu or a menu on long press when holding a message
[2018-09-10 14:14:22] <ThinkDigitalSoftware> It's also nearly impossible to enter code since you struggle with getting a new line entered without submitting the message
[2018-09-10 14:14:31] <ThinkDigitalSoftware> MadLittleMods: 
[2018-09-10 14:26:47] <MadLittleMods> @ThinkDigitalRepair Multi-line messages on mobile aren't really supported. You can track gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-android-app#101You can edit a message by double-tapping on it
[2018-09-10 14:27:18] <ThinkDigitalSoftware> Right, I know about that, but that was something I had to find out the hard way
[2018-09-10 14:27:31] <ThinkDigitalSoftware> Most other chat applications use the long hold option
[2018-09-10 14:27:49] <ThinkDigitalSoftware> Where you find copy, edit and delete in the menu as well
[2018-09-10 14:27:58] <MadLittleMods> ThinkDigitalRepair: I agree that it isn't very intuitive, you can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2018-09-10 14:28:00] <ThinkDigitalSoftware> also, it’s not possible to upload a photo
[2018-09-10 14:28:13] <MadLittleMods> ThinkDigitalRepair: You can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2018-09-10 14:28:14] <ThinkDigitalSoftware> and difficult in regular Gitter as well
[2018-09-10 14:28:25] <ThinkDigitalSoftware> Ok, so all of these are existing issues.
[2018-09-10 14:29:29] <MadLittleMods> ThinkDigitalRepair: You can track [<-ISSUE->] for an upload button in the webapp (currently you just drag and drop). There was a community MR that wasn't finished if you are interested in picking it up again,gitlab-org/gitter/webapp!1094
[2018-09-10 14:30:16] <ThinkDigitalSoftware> May I ask with no negative feelings, and hopefully no offense taken. If this is an app designed for a coding website, why does it take so long (3 years) for what seems to me, to be simple features? I’m looking for insight on this.
[2018-09-10 14:30:58] <ThinkDigitalSoftware> I would love to pick it up, but I’m not that experienced with web development yet :/
[2018-09-10 14:33:55] <MadLittleMods> ThinkDigitalRepair: Different priorities at the time. Nowadays, I am the only Gitter developer so there isn't a lot of bandwidth. We plan on getting another developer on board Q4 or Q1 next year. The apps are open source(iOS soon) and we welcome community contributions
[2018-09-10 14:34:40] <ThinkDigitalSoftware> Oh, OK. Good on ya for taking on such an undertaking! I thought there would be lots of developers. I thought it had belonged to GitHub
[2018-09-10 14:35:22] <ThinkDigitalSoftware> I’ll check out the source code and see if there’s anything I can contribute
[2018-09-10 14:39:34] <MadLittleMods> ThinkDigitalRepair:  [<-LINK->] has a few more well-defined things. If you see an issue that you are interested in, I can point you to the relevant code
[2018-09-10 14:40:06] <ThinkDigitalSoftware> Ok, great! Thank you
[2018-09-11 12:41:44] <5chdn> Hello, I want to create a gitter community for a github org I am owner of. I granted access to private repositories but it does not allow me to select it from the list of organizations. It's probably cached on the gitter side, I tried using a different browser, but that doesn't work either. Any idea what I can try?
[2018-09-11 13:05:03] <MadLittleMods> 5chdn: Try some of the steps here, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-09-11 13:10:43] <5chdn> Yeah, I've been there, done that.@MadLittleMods
[2018-09-11 13:11:27] <5chdn> granted access to org private and public repositories both on my user profile and the org settings
[2018-09-11 13:34:54] <5chdn> Nevermind, it worked now.
[2018-09-12 03:24:45] <seanradley> Hi@MadLittleMods, is it enough to send the email from the owning account when asking for a community to be deleted?
[2018-09-12 03:24:59] <seanradley> Or do you need other ID as well?
[2018-09-12 04:03:56] <MadLittleMods> seanradley: Using the email associated with the account works well but also including your username helps. It's an easy call if all of the rooms are already deleted so the community is empty
[2018-09-12 04:04:37] <seanradley> Thanks
[2018-09-12 15:18:10] <sbromberger> Hey all
[2018-09-12 15:18:19] <sbromberger> I got a very strange redirect notice when downloading the mac client
[2018-09-12 15:18:38] <sbromberger>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-09-12 15:18:55] <sbromberger> What is "Troupe Notifer" (sic)?
[2018-09-12 15:25:12] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] "Troupe" is what Gitter used to be called. "Troupe Notifier" is just the name of the old macOS app
[2018-09-12 15:26:21] <sbromberger> ah, that makes sense. In any case, the redirect message might benefit from updating or at least a spelling correction :)
[2018-09-12 15:39:51] <MadLittleMods> sbromberger: Updated [<-CODE->] 
[2018-09-12 15:45:38] <sbromberger> :)
[2018-09-12 15:45:43] <sbromberger> That works. Thanks!
[2018-09-12 20:04:28] <codeymason> So my new github profile pic shows up as a thumbnail, but when clicked, it is the old photo that pops up next to my github info. i've already logged out and in again several times. i changed my github photo a few days ago.
[2018-09-12 20:05:16] <codeymason> my thumbnail has the red background. the expanded image is me doing a weird handmask thing.
[2018-09-12 22:41:13] <sbromberger> codeymason: - I’m seeing the red background when clicked, FWIW. Perhaps a local image caching issue?
[2018-09-12 23:38:00] <MadLittleMods> codeymason: I also see the red background in both places
[2018-09-13 12:29:40] <cbj4074> I don't... FWIW. ^ I see a red brick background with a window on the left.
[2018-09-13 12:29:53] <cbj4074> (granted, it's been 12+ hours, and I'm on Gitter Desktop)
[2018-09-13 15:26:51] <MadLittleMods> cbj4074: Isn't that the correct image? [<-LINK->] 
[2018-09-14 11:32:09] <steko_gitlab> Hello, the "Please read before joining" message for this chat links to a 404 [<-LINK->] 
[2018-09-14 11:32:21] <steko_gitlab> But that was not my question :-)
[2018-09-14 11:32:47] <steko_gitlab> I wanted to ask if there is a way to login with both GitHub and GitLab to the same account
[2018-09-14 11:46:14] <steko_gitlab> That is, to "merge" the two (or three in the case of Twitter)
[2018-09-14 11:51:36] <sebbu2> i don't think so :( but i'm interested if it's possible
[2018-09-14 14:30:47] <codeymason> sbromberger: @MadLittleModsthanks, very helpful!
[2018-09-14 15:19:44] <MadLittleMods>  September 14, 2018 6:32 AM @sebbu2 Thanks for the heads-up, I updated the welcome message to point to our docs.There isn't a way to merge accounts (multiple OAuth identities). You can track gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1752 and gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1851
[2018-09-14 15:40:40] <steko_gitlab> MadLittleMods: thanks! The links you just posted to GitLab issues point to GitHub (and return another 404, I'm not doing this on purpose)
[2018-09-14 15:41:11] <steko_gitlab> (strangely enough the notification email contains correct links to gitlab.com )
[2018-09-14 15:47:48] <MadLittleMods> steko_gitlab: What client are you using? I assume Android. This was brought up here  [<-LINK->] but it looks like an issue was never created. Mind creating an issue for GitLab issuable decorations opening in GitHub? [<-LINK->] 
[2018-09-14 15:49:50] <xbitlabs> How to implement an authentication server for gitter?
[2018-09-14 15:50:10] <xbitlabs> MadLittleMods: 
[2018-09-14 15:54:28] <MadLittleMods> xbitlabs: I don't understand. Can you explain that differently? What do you mean? What are you trying to do?
[2018-09-14 15:58:09] <xbitlabs> I want to build a chat server by using the source of gitter webapp, and users authenticate through my own server.@MadLittleMods
[2018-09-14 16:02:26] <MadLittleMods> xbitlabs: Look through the [<-CODE->] . You will need to figure it out on your own
[2018-09-14 16:03:00] <steko_gitlab> MadLittleMods: 
[2018-09-14 16:04:14] <steko_gitlab> I'm using Firefox on Android. I will file an issue, thanks!
[2018-09-14 16:04:35] <xbitlabs> MadLittleMods: thanks
[2018-09-14 16:05:11] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @steko_gitlabIn that case (mobile browser), file on [<-LINK->] 
[2018-09-16 12:00:47] <zhihua-chen> Is there a mac installer for Gitter? [<-LINK->] is not working
[2018-09-16 12:04:03] <zhihua-chen> All right. Looks like I can just install gitter-1.162.dmg
[2018-09-16 14:46:33] <MadLittleMods> zhihua-chen: Thanks for the heads-up, working on a fix. You can use these links in the mean time, [<-CODE->] 
[2018-09-16 15:03:52] <MadLittleMods> @zhihua-chen Updated I had to add some headers/properties to the file I updated a couple days ago  September 12, 2018 10:39 AM
[2018-09-16 15:04:07] <zhihua-chen> MadLittleMods: Thanks!
[2018-09-16 19:05:37] <sebbu2> the versionning changed, or ...?
[2018-09-16 19:22:05] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
[2018-09-16 19:58:30] <sebbu2> oh
[2018-09-16 19:58:42] <sebbu2> anyway, i'm using a 3rd party client :D
[2018-09-16 19:58:59] <sebbu2> well, the irc bridge
[2018-09-17 21:52:29] <lukeeey> Glad to see gitter-ios-app
[2018-09-17 21:53:36] <MadLittleMods> ^ The iOS app is now open-source  , https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-ios-appMerge requests welcome!
[2018-09-17 21:54:19] <lukeeey> What is the name of that emoji there ^ i can never remember
[2018-09-17 21:54:33] <MadLittleMods> lukeeey: 
[2018-09-17 21:54:41] <lukeeey> Ah
[2018-09-17 21:55:32] <lukeeey> Not a huge fan of generic app update messages but i like the fact you are open sourcing everything. Havent you done about everything now?
[2018-09-17 21:57:31] <MadLittleMods> lukeeey: I think all of the main things are open-source now. But there is still services/apps and infrastructure code that are private
[2018-09-17 23:13:56] <sebbu2> well, some private stuff still gives open (web or not) API
[2018-09-17 23:14:02] <sebbu2> that's also an option
[2018-09-18 14:39:19] <mydigitalself> Just popped in to say   and shout out to@MadLittleModsfor the iOS open sourcing 
[2018-09-18 14:41:03] <MadLittleMods> mydigitalself: Heya  thanks

[2018-09-18 14:53:53] <MadLittleMods> @mydigitalself What browser are you using to look at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-markdown-processor/blob/master/lib/processor.js ? I can view it in Chrome, signed in and NLIFrom the git-blame at least, it looks like it has been 1 worker since the repo was created. I am not familiar with the worker processing there though
[2018-09-18 15:17:18] <mydigitalself> i'm on chrome latest NLI
[2018-09-18 15:17:34] <MadLittleMods> mydigitalself: Any JS error in the devtools console?

[2018-09-19 19:54:50] <totalhdeveloper_twitter> Hey, Can I do a job post?@MadLittleMods
[2018-09-19 19:56:20] <MadLittleMods> totalhdeveloper_twitter: No, please. Only if the room explicitly says it allows job posting in the room topic in the chat header at the top
[2018-09-24 10:00:49] <benoitc> is this possible today to register to gitter using a self hosted gitlab?
[2018-09-24 10:53:31] <knod> Sorry for putting this question here, but is there a room for github in general?
[2018-09-24 13:17:55] <pdurbin> There used to be a room run by GitHub at [<-LINK->] 
[2018-09-24 14:54:32] <CsatiZoltan> Hi,Is it possible to search the whole room? I experienced that only the currently seen messages can be searched byCtrl+F. On solution is to scroll up many times but that is very tiring for long conversations. TheRoom settings -> Archivesis useful if I want to search in a specific day, but that does not show the full history.
[2018-09-24 15:05:48] <TallTed> CsatiZoltan: - I think your current best bet is to use Google's advanced features, as seen here [<-CODE->] , but their crawler doesn't update as often as you may wish
[2018-09-24 15:08:49] <TallTed> MadLittleMods: Another fun issue with the native app (4.1.0 for macOS)! Close the main window with cmd-W. Now try to re-open it, or quit, or anything else.  I had to force-quit and relaunch Gitter.app.
[2018-09-24 15:18:18] <CsatiZoltan> TallTed: Thanks, though it doesn't work in our room (maybe because it's private?).
[2018-09-24 15:19:37] <TallTed> CsatiZoltan: Ah, yeah, I was going to put in a caveat about publicly crawlable...  One of a long list of problems I have with Gitter.
[2018-09-24 15:22:08] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @benoitcYou can only sign in with [<-LINK->] at the moment
[2018-09-24 15:23:21] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @CsatiZoltan@TallTedThe magnifying glass in the left-menu menu-bar (Ctrl/Cmd + S) will search messages in the current room, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-09-24 15:25:43] <CsatiZoltan> MadLittleMods: Awesome, thanks!
[2018-09-24 15:28:17] <TallTed> @MadLittleMods Oh, hey, that works today! (I tried searching for something else not-long-ago, and no dice ... could have been a hiccup).Weird that there's no scroll bar on the results display ... and wow, the auto-expand-on-mouseover has issues when the expanded data overlaps the top of the display spaec and then collapses because your mouse moves to the next item which is then higher in the list so it expands and then collapses and the lower thing expands -- so the "middle" item disappears.
[2018-09-24 15:29:08] <MadLittleMods> TallTed: You can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2018-09-24 15:30:36] <TallTed> MadLittleMods: It's VERY weird to use ctrl/cmd + S for "Search" (instead of ctrl/cmd + F for "Find") when it's "Save" in virtually every app (including most web browsers)
[2018-09-24 15:59:20] <MadLittleMods> TallTed: We don't overrideCtrl + fbecause it's nice to still use the native browser find, [<-ISSUE->] 
[2018-09-24 16:01:22] <TallTed> MadLittleMods: But youdooverrideCtrl + sbecause ... who would think that meant "save"?
[2018-09-24 16:02:19] <MadLittleMods> TallTed: Saving the page seems a lot less useful for Gitter. Any keybind suggestions?
[2018-09-24 16:18:59] <TallTed>  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] This is a helpful reference, covering Apple's macOS apps -- https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236
[2018-09-24 17:11:01] <mcarpenterjr> MadLittleMods: &@TallTedjust went through this with some internal apps, and the moral question of hijacking native functionality. Essentially our users were relying onCTRL+Fin place of the built in search, to make the experiece better for everyone we allowed the use ofCTRL+Fbut in addition reminded everyone through a toast and some subtle highlighting, that our builtin search is way more powerful and better equipped to search/filter the information in app. It might not be a bad idea to do something similar here.
[2018-09-24 17:13:22] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
[2018-09-24 17:15:27] <mcarpenterjr> Yes, we still allow the use of what ever the native crtl+f is we just gently remind our users that builtin search is better. So they're still in control of their browsing experience.
[2018-09-25 00:15:16] <kyraha> My Gitter channel is quite quiet but I would like to let my team in other chat solutions be informed if there's an activity. But I don't want to constantly run a process on a server listening for the API. A simple webhook would be a better solution - whenver there's a message in my Gitter channel a POST request would go to a configured URL (AWS Lambda). Does Gitter support something like that? I couldn't find anything in the documentation. Thank you.
[2018-09-25 00:17:08] <MadLittleMods> kyraha: There isn't anything built-in to Gitter for that. Seems like you may want to use [<-LINK->] 
[2018-09-25 00:24:32] <kyraha> MadLittleMods: That's interesting, 5 messages/day may be OK for most of the time but won't cover a conversation if there's a burst once in a while. I'm not ready to pay $50/month for a mostly idle pipe. I was looking for a solution that I could host in a pay-per-use cloud. But thank you anyway.
[2018-09-25 00:29:30] <MadLittleMods> kyraha: You can track [<-ISSUE->] , merge request welcome!
[2018-09-25 00:31:07] <kyraha> yes, exactly that! thanks!
[2018-09-25 17:59:43] <alexandred> is it possible to have a user IP banned?
[2018-09-25 18:15:00] <MadLittleMods> alexandred: We can ban them from Gitter overall. Send an email tosupport@gitter.imwith the details
[2018-09-25 18:15:28] <alexandred> MadLittleMods: thanks, will do
[2018-09-25 18:42:22] <alexandred> MadLittleMods: ive sent an email but I havent heard a response back yet - there is a user who is constantly spamming the chat and it is impacting things now
[2018-09-25 18:46:54] <alexandred> InternetUnexplorer: @MadLittleModsthis is the user, seems like he has followed me here
[2018-09-25 18:46:56] <alexandred> sorry about that
[2018-09-25 18:50:25] <InternetUnexplorer> alexandred: No worries; they've been banned from here and should be banned elsewhere soon.
[2018-09-25 18:51:08] <alexandred> okay great thanks
[2018-09-25 18:52:44] <InternetUnexplorer> You can click on the three dots next to each message to report them; if enough reports pile up from different users they will be prevented from sending new messages.Otherwise you can wait until@MadLittleMods(or another Gitter employee) can take care of it manually, but from the looks of it this is a fairly time-sensitive issue .
[2018-09-25 18:53:38] <alexandred> InternetUnexplorer: they will be prevented on an IP basis from sending new messages?
[2018-09-25 18:53:55] <alexandred> as ive already banned 5 of their accounts from my chat at this point so that isnt really stopping them
[2018-09-25 18:57:00] <InternetUnexplorer> alexandred: I don't believe it's an IP ban, unfortunately. I'm not sure what the best thing to do is in this situation, as they seem to be going to a lot of effort (creating multiple accounts) to send spam, and so an IP ban might not stop them.
[2018-09-25 19:04:53] <InternetUnexplorer> alexandred: To clarify: while I've been granted admin permissions in somegitterHQrooms to help with spam, I don't work for Gitter/Gitlab (just a community member), and so I'm afraid I can't do much to help.However,@MadLittleModsdoes work for Gitter/Gitlab and is fairly active here, so hopefully he can help you with this.
[2018-09-25 19:08:15] <alexandred> InternetUnexplorer: aha i see, thanks for your help regardless!
[2018-09-25 19:18:20] <alexandred> InternetUnexplorer: is it possible to lock a gitter room temporarily? (i.e disallow new users from joining)
[2018-09-25 20:19:57] <MadLittleMods> alexandred: Looking into this now
[2018-09-25 20:25:16] <TallTed> MadLittleMods: - I'm guessing that ban discussed above happened after someone spammed this room with 11 messages ... because my app now shows this room with 11 unread messages, which I cannot clear with scrolling up and down nor with quitting-and-relaunching the app.  So any room with such spam activity resulting in a ban while people in the room haven't yet seen the spam will show as having unread messages forever more....
[2018-09-25 20:45:02] <rostrander_gitlab> TallTed: I've found shutting down the browser and restarting it will fix that
[2018-09-25 20:45:45] <MadLittleMods> TallTed: @rostrander_gitlabI'm working on fixing the stuck unreads atm
[2018-09-25 20:46:24] <rostrander_gitlab> Good because restarting didn't fix it :)
[2018-09-25 20:46:41] <TallTed> rostrander_gitlab: - No browser. macOS native app.
[2018-09-25 21:30:56] <knod> pdurbin: That room seems to require authorized access or something.
[2018-09-25 21:31:28] <knod> Also, if you use @ and then my username, I'll get a message that you replied to me I think.
[2018-09-25 21:32:20] <MadLittleMods> @knod The room was deletedused to be a room  September 24, 2018 8:17 AM
[2018-09-25 21:59:08] <MadLittleMods> Fixed stuck unreads in this room gitlab-org/gitter/webapp!1245
[2018-09-25 22:14:00] <alexandred> MadLittleMods: unfortunately banning this guys' accounts isn't stopping him, he just keeps coming back. is there a way to temporarily lock the chat room?
[2018-09-25 22:14:44] <MadLittleMods> @alexandred We can make it private . Acceptable?Anyone with access atm will be able to chat
[2018-09-25 22:15:05] <alexandred> MadLittleMods: yeah that would be ideal
[2018-09-25 22:15:54] <alexandred> is that some option I can just toggle somewhere?
[2018-09-25 22:17:22] <MadLittleMods> alexandred: No, working on manually updating it now
[2018-09-25 22:19:05] <MadLittleMods> alexandred: Updated [<-LINK->] . Can you still access it?
[2018-09-25 22:24:39] <alexandred> MadLittleMods: yep i still can
[2018-09-25 22:25:27] <alexandred> thanks for that, I'll probably message you in a few days when this has died down to have it made public again
[2018-09-25 22:26:07] <MadLittleMods> alexandred: , I updated [<-LINK->] with this change
[2018-09-25 22:26:38] <alexandred> awesome, thanks for your help
[2018-09-25 22:26:49] <MadLittleMods> alexandred: You're welcome!
[2018-09-25 23:25:43] <TallTed> MadLittleMods:  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-09-25 23:59:13] <pdurbin> I usually don't@mentionpeople because it's inconvenient from the IRC gateway. In normal IRC, you can just start typing the person's name and hit tab but with the Gitter IRC gateway I don't even see all nicks from my IRC client. So I don't always bother. It would be great to improve this situation some day.
[2018-09-26 00:00:15] <MadLittleMods> pdurbin: MR welcome, [<-ISSUE->] 
[2018-09-26 00:00:16] <pdurbin> MadLittleMods: good job with the stuck unreads thing
[2018-09-26 00:00:55] <pdurbin> Huh, so it's a number of users per room limit. Interesting.
[2018-09-26 00:01:40] <MadLittleMods> pdurbin: Whenever a message comes in, we can add that user to the member list ( [<-LINK->] )
[2018-09-26 00:01:44] <pdurbin> On freenode you sometimes get shunted to an "overflow" channel if there are too many nicks, but that's pretty rare. When there are hundreds and hundreds.
[2018-09-26 00:02:49] <pdurbin> Ok, so the idea is to start with 30 from the API and then add more nicks who speak?
[2018-09-26 00:03:02] <MadLittleMods> pdurbin: Exactly 
[2018-09-26 00:03:56] <MadLittleMods> pdurbin: Code is here,https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/irc-bridge/blob/1e752b692b5ec8c64b046cccfe35d53c6e7b50bf/lib/gitter-adapter.js#L179
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/irc-bridge/blob/1e752b692b5ec8c64b046cccfe35d53c6e7b50bf/lib/gitter-adapter.js#L342-356
[2018-09-26 00:06:34] <pdurbin> Cool. Maybe link to this chat from the issue so someone can find the code again. I wonder if I should switch from the IRC gateway to whatever normal client. I use the fat Slack client at work. I just like how lean and mean IRC is.
[2018-09-26 00:06:53] <MadLittleMods> pdurbin:  Already updated the issue description
[2018-09-26 00:11:40] <pdurbin> Cool. Thanks. So how's the fat client for Gitter on Mac and Linux? I'd rather not deal with chat in a browser.
[2018-09-26 00:12:37] <MadLittleMods> pdurbin: It's not native. 4.x is NW.js-based and 1.7x for macOS is Safari-based (4.x also available unsigned for macOS)
[2018-09-26 00:13:03] <pdurbin> Unsigned is fine. I use homebrew.
[2018-09-26 00:15:07] <MadLittleMods> pdurbin: https://gitter.im/apps
https://update.gitter.im/osx/Gitter-4.1.0.dmg
[2018-09-26 00:16:02] <pdurbin> Thanks. My daughter is doing homework on our iMac at the moment so I'm on Ubuntu.
[2018-09-26 00:18:06] <charafau> why are you doing this to your daughter and using superior system by yourself ? ;)
[2018-09-26 00:19:03] <pdurbin> Heh. She's on a deadline. :)
[2018-09-26 00:20:26] <pdurbin> That was sent from the Gitter client on Ubuntu. Seems to work fine. Maybe I'll try this for  a while. And actually, I don't want to junk up the family iMac with lots of apps. But I'll see about installing the Gitter app on my Mac at work.
[2018-09-26 00:21:41] <pdurbin> And, of course,@mentionswork fine from the native client. /cc@knod
[2018-09-26 00:32:13] <pdurbin> I see how to control notifications on a per-room basis from within the Linux client but I can't find any sort of global setting.
[2018-09-26 02:34:39] <MadLittleMods> pdurbin: "Configure defaults" in the bottom-left of any notification modal
[2018-09-26 10:50:09] <knod> MadLittleMods: : Ah, got it. Thanks for letting me know!@pdurbin: lol, almost didn't catch that one either, but I do get why you'd choose to do that when that was how it was working for you. I have to say, there are a lot of things I prefer about IRC too. And that last mention worked like a charm! Thanks!
[2018-09-26 11:24:55] <pdurbin> MadLittleMods: are you saying I have to wait for the next notifications modal (popup) to pop up before I can change my default notification settings?
[2018-09-26 13:12:41] <dajiaonao> Hi, I notice that in mattermost, when one user reply to another one, they can form a "conversation" that can be shown on a right panel separating from the main stream. This is quite useful when there are several topics on-going simultaneously. Does gitter have a similar feature? I only findmention, which does not bring any history of the conversion, andQuotewhich might bright too heavy history when the conversation become long... Thanks.
[2018-09-26 14:53:07] <alexandred> is it possible to block a user from PMing?
[2018-09-26 14:53:28] <alexandred> this troll from yesterday is still persisting
[2018-09-26 14:53:47] <alexandred> had to prevent new users from interacting with my github repo as he started spamming there lol
[2018-09-26 14:58:51] <alexandred> in particular, the user vcreatyv has not yet been banned from the platform
[2018-09-26 15:17:01] <cbj4074> Lol... what'd you do to get this individual fired-up? (Somewhat rhetorical...)
[2018-09-26 15:17:44] <alexandred> lets leave him unbanned from the platform for now, i'm trying to have a conversation with him as he is spamming my public facing emails too
[2018-09-26 15:17:59] <alexandred> cbj4074: i run an OSS and he was getting very demanding with us helping him
[2018-09-26 15:18:18] <alexandred> he wasnt happy that we werent holding his hand through the steps and he eventually just lost it
[2018-09-26 15:23:25] <InternetUnexplorer> alexandred: For the time being, I would keep reporting the PMs until the Gitter admins can take care of it. I know it's not great, but it's better than nothing I suppose (as it alerts the Gitter admins).
[2018-09-26 15:24:57] <InternetUnexplorer> Also, if you contact GitHub support, they should be able to help you. Considering this started on GitHub and he/she is creating new accounts to send spam, they should be interested in this.
[2018-09-26 15:25:12] <alexandred> InternetUnexplorer: they've already banned 5 of his accounts lol
[2018-09-26 15:48:03] <cbj4074> alexandred: Ahh... yep, seen that many times before, unfortunately. :( If only the individual spent as much time educating himself as annoying you...
[2018-09-26 16:21:02] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @pdurbinNo, see [<-LINK->] for adjusting your notification settings
[2018-09-26 16:22:12] <MadLittleMods>  September 26, 2018 8:12 AM @dajiaonao You can track gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#741 for threaded discussion.If you just want to chat with another person, you can hover there name and "Chat privately" which will create a one to one room
[2018-09-26 16:23:10] <pdurbin> Huh. I don't remember seeing that "Configure Defaults" button but I'll check when I'm back on Linux. Thanks.
[2018-09-26 16:31:29] <MadLittleMods>  September 26, 2018 9:53 AM @alexandred There isn't a way to block a user, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#245, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#370 but if they are harassing you, we can ban them from GitterPing again if you want them banned and I can investigate
[2018-09-26 17:04:00] <TallTed>  September 26, 2018 12:21 PM@MadLittleMods - The "CONFIGURE DEFAULTS" text at lower-left of those dialogs isn't a button. Neither is "ROOM SETTINGS"."Clever" design that obscures functionality isn't clever. (UI that requires documentation to be understood isn't good UI.)Both of those text elements should be painted as buttons and get "…" appended, so it's clear they open a further dialog.  (I also suggest changing the title of the room-focused "Notification Settings" to "Room Notification Settings" because without that leading "Room" it looks like it will have a larger effect -- and in fact the "CONFIGURE DEFAULTS" at lower left currently appears to be a label for the dialog, not a control.)
[2018-09-26 18:30:23] <jasongrout> Hi everyone. Is there a way to archive an old inactive gitter room, so that people can't post there anymore, but the archives are still available? I don't want to delete the room, since the delete dialog box mentions that all messages will be deleted and we would like to keep the messages in the room as an archive.
[2018-09-26 19:07:52] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @TallTedI agree, we just don't have a central settings place for more general stuff like this atm
[2018-09-26 19:09:00] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @jasongroutIt's not possible at the moment, [<-ISSUE->] 
[2018-09-26 19:22:59] <jasongrout> Thanks@MadLittleMods.
[2018-09-26 20:53:10] <TallTed> MadLittleMods: - I'm not so much concerned about the lack of a central settings dialog (though that is certainly a major lack!), as about the inconsistent presentation of controlsascontrols, rather than as inactive decorative pixels.
[2018-09-26 21:32:02] <MadLittleMods> @TallTed It looks like a button to me. Am I missing something? [<-CODE->] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/505c1d1a2cd258bf576958a149e85f723c30bb13/public/js/views/modals/notification-settings-view.js#L262
[2018-09-26 21:38:44] <TallTed> @MadLittleMods -Yes, you're missing something. Regardless of the HTML code which makes it function as a button, the CSS makes it appear as not-a-control. Look at the screencaps in the doc you linked earlier! Here's a shortcut -- https://i.imgur.com/avukqAD.pngNote that there is no "button" border surrounding that "CONFIGURE DEFAULTS" text (unlike "APPLY"). There's also no underscoring to hint that it's a link. It just looks like decoration on the dialog.
[2018-09-26 21:43:47] <MadLittleMods> @TallTed I see. I am not going to mess with our styleguide for now. It's the secondary button style, another example in the app,
[2018-09-26 21:43:51] <TallTed> @MadLittleModsMaybe just change -- [<-CODE->] -- to -- [<-CODE->] 
[2018-09-26 21:45:20] <MadLittleMods> TallTed: I'd rather work on a home for central settings which is obvious to begin with, [<-ISSUE->] 
[2018-09-26 21:45:41] <TallTed> That's not a button either!  Regardless of what your styleguide says.  Concealing controls is not user friendly.
[2018-09-26 21:46:59] <TallTed> Knowing this is used in multiple places, the place to fix itisin the CSS, and not in this specific dialog ...
[2018-09-26 21:49:12] <TallTed> Secondary button should stilllook like a button.It might lose the solid green highlight of the "default" or "primary", but it should still have a border.  Look at most every mainstream native app you have -- you'll find they do this.  There are reasons why.
[2018-09-26 21:50:15] <TallTed> If you can point me to that region of the CSS, I'll take a crack at fixing this.  It won't be much of a change (though the classname won't change from__linkto__btnbecause that would require changes in many places).  ...  andreadingthis className makes me seriously question its use as "secondary button."
[2018-09-26 21:51:17] <MadLittleMods> TallTed: I'm not disagreeing. It's just not what I am going to focus on with my limited bandwidth. The styleguide project is here, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-09-26 21:52:31] <MadLittleMods> TallTed: I am concerned about the change being consistent with the rest of what we already have but I am open if you have something creative
[2018-09-26 21:54:50] <TallTed> If it's used where things really are LINKs, a BUTTON styling won't look right ... but it's definitely being used where things really are BUTTONs and the current LINK styling is clearly broken.  (Of course, an unhighlighted link is just text, so maybe there's a highlight technique to apply ... even just the old-fashioned blue-underline style!)  Consistency for its own sake is not a good goal.
[2018-09-26 22:02:45] <pdurbin> MadLittleMods: ok, I'm back on Linux and indeed there is something callied "Configure Defaults" but I'm 100% with@TallTedthat it looks nothing like a button. This is a usability issue.
[2018-09-26 22:07:13] <MadLittleMods> @pdurbin I agree, it trips many people upI am fine with a quick MR to change the classBut I think the real solution is having known place for general settings, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1993Curious, where were you trying to find the default notification settings?
[2018-09-26 22:17:20] <pdurbin> MadLittleMods: I thought I would click my ugly mug, then Settings, then Notifications, and then quiet things down.
[2018-09-26 22:17:52] <MadLittleMods> pdurbin:  Thanks, didn't want to prompt you with that idea but that is also what I have in mind
[2018-09-26 22:17:59] <pdurbin> The link to that issue doesn't work from the web archive, by the way. It leads to a 404 on GitHub. Dunno if that's a known issue or not.
[2018-09-26 22:19:04] <MadLittleMods> @pdurbin This archive? https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter/archives/2018/09/26 ? Seems to link to GitLab fine for mePerhaps on mobile? gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1985
[2018-09-26 22:19:40] <pdurbin> Yes. Mobile. Chrome on Android.
[2018-09-26 22:28:45] <MadLittleMods> pdurbin: It's a strange issue. I linked some relevant code if you are interested in fixing. Seems like we can just remove themobileDecorator.jsand useissuableDecorator.js, [<-ISSUE->] 
[2018-09-26 22:48:51] <pdurbin> Huh. I tried to log in to GitLab to leave a comment on that issue but I can't log in anymore.
[2018-09-26 23:04:01] <pdurbin> I wonder if it's because I clicked on the "login with GitHub" button when I shouldn't have since I do have a GitLab account.
[2018-09-27 14:29:35] <dajiaonao> MadLittleMods: Thanks. That's the feature I'm expecting, but seems the developers are reluctant to add it :(.  Anyone know what I'm talking about? I guess our conversation is already buried... showing  how that feature could help : )
[2018-09-27 16:18:06] <MadLittleMods> dajiaonao: re:buried, You can use a permalink to point to a previous message,  [<-LINK->] . Click the timestamp in the top-right of any message and copy the address bar. You can also alt + click the timestamp to get a markdown snippet
[2018-09-28 02:03:27] <dajiaonao> MadLittleMods: That's a bit clumsy :). Say, what if you have 10 messages on the same topic scattering in 200 irrelevant ones? [<-LINK->] 
[2018-09-28 02:04:27] <MadLittleMods> dajiaonao: I realize you are after threaded discussion, [<-ISSUE->] but you mentioned our conversation being buried so I pointed out a way to help with that for now
[2018-09-28 02:10:27] <dajiaonao> MadLittleMods: I see, thanks. You do support this feature. BTW, the timestamp link helps for backward navigation, how about the forward? Maybe a link the to the reply can beautomaticallyadded to the original one?
[2018-09-28 02:20:34] <MadLittleMods> dajiaonao: Sounds nice to me. Feel free to create an issue, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-09-28 13:03:22] <alexandred> MadLittleMods: hey there! is it possible yo

[2018-09-28 13:19:35] <TallTed> MadLittleMods: - This room has a phantom unread (by which I mean undisplayed/unrendered, because no system can automatically detect when I've actually seen never mind read a post) again... so it seems your fix needs a tweak.
[2018-09-28 15:28:22] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @alexandred [<-LINK->] has been updated with its original security descriptor 
[2018-09-28 15:35:51] <MadLittleMods>  September 28, 2018 8:19 AM @TallTed It was just a fix for the script that cleans stuck unreads so they could still happen [<-CODE->] 
[2018-09-28 15:39:25] <MadLittleMods> TallTed: Created [<-ISSUE->] to track the problem

[2018-09-28 17:40:19] <MadLittleMods> sebbu2: It looks like you are using the irc-bridge but that is still the integration activity
[2018-09-28 17:40:44] <sebbu2> yes i'm using irc bridge
[2018-09-29 23:02:54] <white_hat_Eric_twitter> Hello, Eve
[2018-09-29 23:03:36] <white_hat_Eric_twitter> And that is why you don't text while walking
[2018-09-29 23:05:56] <white_hat_Eric_twitter> Hello, everyone.  Just installed the app, and I cannot figure out how to message another user.  The "people" tab says "search for users", but doesnt actually offer me a search box.  I'm on Android Oreo and have screenshots if necessary.
[2018-09-29 23:35:43] <pdurbin> sure, let's see a screenshot
[2018-09-30 00:13:24] <white_hat_Eric_twitter> Seeing as how I cannot upload pictures to chat, how would you like me to send it?
[2018-09-30 01:47:57] <MadLittleMods> @white_hat_Eric_twitter Which app (iOS or Android)?For Android, go back to the all conversations screen and use the magnifying glass search in the top-rightThere isn't image upload in the apps so you will need to upload elsewhere and link it, gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-android-app#102
[2018-10-02 14:57:46] <FanrayMedia> I'm new to gitter and I created duplicate communities, how do I delete the one I don't want anymore?
[2018-10-02 15:02:57] <FanrayMedia> Also how do you rename a room?
[2018-10-02 15:09:39] <MadLittleMods> FanrayMedia: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/communities.md#delete-a-community
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/rooms.md#rename-a-room
[2018-10-02 15:11:17] <FanrayMedia> MadLittleMods: thank you, any plans to add these basic features?
[2018-10-02 15:13:01] <MadLittleMods> FanrayMedia: Yes (Merge Request welcome)gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1162
I don't see an issue for deleting a community (feel free to create one)
[2018-10-02 15:41:54] <FanrayMedia> And is there a way to delete a conversation? I can't find any docs on that.
[2018-10-02 15:42:23] <MadLittleMods> FanrayMedia: You can delete a message, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-10-02 15:42:35] <MadLittleMods> FanrayMedia: Do you mean delete a one on one? You can only hide those rooms
[2018-10-02 15:47:44] <FanrayMedia> MadLittleMods: yeah I meant one-on-one :(  Thanks.
[2018-10-03 18:49:53] <melvincarvalho> Hi all, do you know of there are any plans to introduce threaded conversations to gitter?
[2018-10-03 18:53:09] <MadLittleMods> melvincarvalho: Yes, [<-ISSUE->] and it's on the [<-LINK->] (dates not accurate)
[2018-10-03 18:53:20] <melvincarvalho> thank you!
[2018-10-03 18:54:05] <melvincarvalho> FYI : not to name drop but the inventor of the web is a gitter user and was asking :)
[2018-10-03 18:55:12] <MadLittleMods> melvincarvalho: 
[2018-10-03 18:55:28] <MadLittleMods> If this is discussed on a Twitter thread or something, I can also respond there (link it)
[2018-10-03 18:56:26] <TallTed> MadLittleMods: - I'm betting it's in a gitter thread... in one of the channels I'm many messages behind on. /cc@melvincarvalho
[2018-10-03 18:57:08] <melvincarvalho> no it's just in a small gitter dev chat ... ps hi@TallTed

[2018-10-03 21:57:02] <pdurbin> neat how they have pictures of their contributors: [<-LINK->] 
[2018-10-04 15:51:38] <MadLittleMods> @pareshhp This room is for Gitter support, the chat app itself, not general technical support. Please read the room topic/description at the top and the welcome messageYou could try asking in https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/developers
[2018-10-04 15:54:36] <pareshhp> MadLittleMods: oh, ok thank you for informing (yes)
[2018-10-04 17:10:51] <mgarland650_twitter> Is it possible to send formatted code blocks with gitter?
[2018-10-04 17:12:12] <TallTed> mgarland650_twitter: -  yes, as gitter supports (some flavor of) markdown.  wrap your block in three-backticks "```" [<-CODE->] 
[2018-10-07 18:56:29] <MadLittleMods> whitebird128: @richardlowenthalThis room is for Gitter support, not general chatter. Please stop
[2018-10-09 04:34:58] <aakashsplinter> Can we make a seprate channel for solodity support!!!
[2018-10-09 04:35:54] <MadLittleMods> aakashsplinter: See [<-LINK->] 
[2018-10-09 10:02:02] <AndreasWebdev> Hey there, is there something I'm missing when creating a room? Clicking on "Create and finish" results in an Unauthorized 502 (Bad Gateway) error in the console
[2018-10-09 14:04:20] <MadLittleMods> @AndreasWebdev What room are you trying to create? Is is associated with any repo? [<-CODE->] 
[2018-10-09 17:16:57] <RedBaron2> I'm having a rather blurry text issue with the gitter appI have a screenshot but I don't know how to attach it in the web app
[2018-10-09 18:18:44] <MadLittleMods> @RedBaron2 Which OS are you on?Related discussion  August 14, 2018 5:14 PM
[2018-10-09 18:21:42] <RedBaron2> windows 10 build 1809 insider
[2018-10-09 18:23:11] <MadLittleMods> @RedBaron2 You can upload the screenshot by dragging and dropping onto the chat area or upload somewhere else first (like imgur)Related issue, gitlab-org/gitter/desktop#155
[2018-10-09 18:53:53] <AndreasWebdev> MadLittleMods: seemed to be a problem with inviting a person not using gitter yet.. I put in his github username and an email and it responded with the Unauthorized. Once I reloaded the page and created a room without inviting that person, it worked flawlessly
[2018-10-09 19:21:58] <MadLittleMods> AndreasWebdev: Mind creating an issue with those details? [<-LINK->] (you were creating a community)
[2018-10-09 21:35:10] <RedBaron2>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-10-09 21:35:55] <RedBaron2> madlittlemods: 
[2018-10-09 21:36:12] <RedBaron2> It just doesn't look right to me
[2018-10-09 21:36:56] <MadLittleMods> @RedBaron2 Whoa. It looks like it is double-rendering text with two different fonts (never seen before). Does it look this way if you visit https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter on Chrome?Have you seen this with any other apps?Are you on a high-DPI display?
[2018-10-09 22:05:25] <RedBaron2> it doesn't look like that on any other application/app web or otherwise. even modern gitter from the MS store works fine. I'm using it now
[2018-10-09 22:05:49] <RedBaron2> Also No to the high dpi display
[2018-10-09 22:17:01] <MadLittleMods> @RedBaron2 Did it ever work fine for you? I am on Windows 10 (not insider) and it looks fineIf you open the devtools(in the "Gitter" menu in the top-left) and start messing with some CSS properties, does it correct itself? [<-CODE->] 
[2018-10-09 22:23:03] <RedBaron2> madlittlemods: I tried reinstalling it over the top and that didn't help. I haven't tried uninstalling it and reinstalling; as for the source haven't tried that; and it did work fine until this latest update
[2018-10-09 22:33:26] <RedBaron2> the latest windows 10 update just to be clear
[2018-10-10 04:05:49] <MadLittleMods> RedBaron2: In that case, I am not sure there is something I can fix but open to a MR if you find something
[2018-10-10 04:54:04] <RedBaron2> MadLittleMods: I will try to keep you apprised of any solutions.
[2018-10-10 12:45:03] <JohanLarsson> Hi! Is there a way to move rooms for repositories that have moved to new github organisations?

[2018-10-10 22:52:55] <pdurbin> Does it? :)
[2018-10-10 22:53:23] <roflcopter3123> Well not anymore or im tricked into another ai way above my knowledge
[2018-10-10 22:54:41] <roflcopter3123> Is it possible to find some developer friends in here to help eachother on problems?
[2018-10-10 22:55:12] <pdurbin> That's more on topic at [<-LINK->] 
[2018-10-10 22:55:57] <roflcopter3123> ahhh thank you very much thats what im looking for

[2018-10-11 02:07:39] <yyyc514> Is there a way to get rid of that useless messaeg once I’ve read it once?
[2018-10-11 02:07:44] <yyyc514> it’s very annoying
[2018-10-11 04:14:23] <MadLittleMods> @yyyc514 Drag and drop it where the chat messages areThere isn't a way to remove the chat input placeholder
[2018-10-11 11:11:33] <taburetkin> hi guys.i am occasionally switched to dark theme and there is no way to go back to the light one.and in dark theme there is a little css bug - some chat messages has inner scroll.win10, latest chrome, web versionmaybe i just do not see how to switch back to light theme?
[2018-10-11 11:12:26] <taburetkin> ah! never mind :))) i found :D
[2018-10-11 16:07:39] <yyyc514> MadLittleMods: Is this an electron app could i just hack the source?
[2018-10-11 16:17:17] <InternetUnexplorer> yyyc514: Here is the source for the desktop app: [<-LINK->] 
[2018-10-11 17:11:59] <deleteaccount1234567890> How did you hide me - If I am new for Gitter where is ban and kick? If I create room than i can't see any features. I feel they lie me
[2018-10-11 17:51:49] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @taburetkinYou can track [<-ISSUE->] for inner scroll bars
[2018-10-11 17:54:25] <MadLittleMods>  October 11, 2018 12:11 PM @deleteaccount1234567890If you are the admin of the room, [<-CODE->] 
[2018-10-11 22:00:36] <deleteaccount1234567890> thanks for explanation. I never know that. How did you have experiences about "/ban" and "/remove" wow.. I never see how did admin "kick" if I see like who kicks me from room and I join again - It looks like /kick@usernameright
[2018-10-11 22:28:15] <MadLittleMods> deleteaccount1234567890: /kickdoes not exist. There is no activity entry for/removebut there is a message in the activity for/ban
[2018-10-11 23:50:41] <lifeofJanardhan_twitter> Hi I am new here. It seems gitter is employing elasticsearch:1.4.2, just curious about whether you are going to update to newer version since some plugins(for instance, Elastichq/elasticsearch) doesn't seem to support elasticsearch:1.x
[2018-10-11 23:54:12] <deleteaccount1234567890> Thanks for explanation! I will try
[2018-10-12 00:13:34] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @lifeofJanardhan_twitterThere isn't an upgrade plan set out but it is one of the technical debt burdens to address. Especially because the ES 1.4 river plugin that syncs data from MongoDB to Elasticsearch is awful (can't re-sync if it falls behind)ES 1.4 for search
ES 2.x for logging/Kibana
ES 5.x for typeahead
[2018-10-12 12:19:22] <mcarpenterjr> MadLittleMods: Was/Would there be consideration to move away from river to logstash's jdbc input support? You would have to find the right driver and write some queries but it might be worth it.
[2018-10-12 15:44:23] <jgeorgeson> is it possible to have both github and gitlab associated with same gitter profile?
[2018-10-12 17:37:58] <MadLittleMods> @jgeorgeson https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/accounts.md#can-i-mergeconnect-my-accountsgitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1752
[2018-10-12 17:39:44] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @mcarpenterjrSorry, I don't have time today to discuss. Mind creating an issue with more details and why you want to change?
[2018-10-12 17:41:29] <mcarpenterjr> Yes I can do that.
[2018-10-12 17:50:32] <pdurbin> MadLittleMods: busy day?
[2018-10-12 18:01:03] <jgeorgeson> thanks@MadLittleMods
[2018-10-12 20:08:01] <yyyc514> Ugh,
[2018-10-12 20:08:09] <yyyc514> why is gitter’s minimize keystroke so damn CRAZY?
[2018-10-12 20:08:14] <yyyc514> APple-M doesn’t even seem to have another use
[2018-10-13 00:24:45] <MadLittleMods> yyyc514:  [<-ISSUE->] 
[2018-10-13 01:27:06] <MadLittleMods> Heads-up, I am taking two weeks off and will be back on 2018-10-29
[2018-10-14 06:11:33] <ankkkit> Hi everyone
[2018-10-15 17:47:09] <rebolek> this room shows two unread messages and I can't get rid of it.
[2018-10-15 18:15:00] <rostrander_gitlab> I'll unstick them at some point today when I'm at a computer that can do so
[2018-10-15 18:29:37] <mcarpenterjr> rostrander_gitlab: Thank You. 
[2018-10-15 21:47:30] <rostrander_gitlab> Okay, unread messages should be cleared (if they're not gone on their own, reloading the page should do it)
[2018-10-16 09:19:53] <chengshidongchouchou> hello everybody
[2018-10-16 12:04:26] <rebolek> rostrander_gitlab: thanks, fixed
[2018-10-17 03:26:26] <rostrander_gitlab> safavie_gitlab: This room's for discussion about Gitter itself, so probably won't be of much help.  You might want to try another room, but also make sure to provide more details if you do - it's impossible for anyone to help you with what you've given us (we'd just be guessing at what might be wrong).  See [<-LINK->] for guidance on what to include
[2018-10-18 07:31:16] <arunkumar413> In the Android client nothing happens when I touch on the user icon or username
[2018-10-18 07:31:43] <arunkumar413> I expect it to show the profile info such as GitHub etc
[2018-10-18 16:04:02] <kayagoban> I'm confused about how to choose a community domain slug.
[2018-10-18 17:51:37] <ryantcassidy> hey, i've got a question if the intended behavior for drag-n-dropping files on the chat window is supposed to be 'auto-upload to the chat room without a confirmation dialog'
[2018-10-18 17:52:31] <ryantcassidy> a trackpad bump caused me to "drag a file" from my downloads bar on the bottom of chrome right into the chat window. it was a sensitive file. >:|
[2018-10-18 19:20:57] <mcarpenterjr> I can't speak for gitter staff but, I would expect drag and drop to be pretty intentional and not require a confirmation.
[2018-10-18 21:25:30] <ryantcassidy> On a specific file upload screen sure
[2018-10-18 21:25:41] <ryantcassidy> But not when the entire chat window is a valid drop target... give a user a chance to click OK
[2018-10-19 08:05:08] <Fuzzyma> Has someone else the issue that one gets no notification from the smartphone app?
[2018-10-19 08:05:19] <Fuzzyma> Me and my coworker both face this issue
[2018-10-19 08:05:26] <Fuzzyma> Off notifications are enabled

[2018-10-19 10:49:23] <17Bunny> Use this software for the first time and how it should be used. Who dares to help me?
[2018-10-20 17:40:57] <erkanisik1> hi how can I get the contact form on the website into the room
[2018-10-21 04:44:19] <miigotu> MadLittleMods: is there any way to connect to irc bridge without a server password, maybe with a nickserv password/token? irccloud makes you pay for server passwords -.-
[2018-10-21 07:20:18] <rebolek> rostrander_gitlab: unread message problem is back
[2018-10-22 06:56:25] <olwee> Hi, I am trying to use the Gitter API, but keep getting '401 Unauthorized' with my PAT, can any staff help me?
[2018-10-22 06:57:02] <olwee> For reference, I am attempting to call the GET/rooms/endpoint
[2018-10-23 14:35:56] <gitleet> MadLittleMods: Trying to understand how gitter does things in realtime using faye.  Do you use websockets or Bayeux?  I know the websockets library is faye but is there a tutorial on how to use the websockets client?
[2018-10-23 16:09:54] <pdurbin> He's on vacation for another week.
[2018-10-23 23:36:35] <DM1145> Any pointers on updating one's avatar?
[2018-10-23 23:41:40] <DM1145> Figured it out..  N/M
[2018-10-24 16:28:01] <dalefrancis88> Hey team, i've searched the documentation and can't seem to find how to block users from private messaging you. Is this a feature at the moment?
[2018-10-24 16:41:10] <rostrander_gitlab> I'm not sure offhand, actually.  You should be able to report them via the dropdown by their name; if they're spamming that's definitely something I can take care of
[2018-10-24 16:42:57] <dalefrancis88> He's not spamming in the channels much, it's just he's asking a lot of questions since i helped him with somethings but he's not really trying to solve his own problem and he keeps just dropping the code in that i send but not trying to understand it so it'll break and then he doesnt try to fix it
[2018-10-24 16:45:25] <rostrander_gitlab> Ah, in that case I'd tell him what you just told me.  Nobody can help him if he does that, it's only hurting himself in the long run after all.
[2018-10-24 16:45:44] <rostrander_gitlab> If he doesn't stop after you tell him to, though, that's essentially escalating and I can look into it
[2018-10-24 17:00:16] <dalefrancis88> Cool will do, thanks for the advice   :D
[2018-10-24 21:18:21] <gdejohn> I tried to make a community for a [<-LINK->] of mine (no organization), and it said the address was unavailable. Going to the URL gives a 404. Is it possible to claim that address?
[2018-10-24 21:19:02] <dalefrancis88> i think when that happens it's because there is something there but it's private
[2018-10-24 21:19:23] <gdejohn> Ah.
[2018-10-25 04:28:36] <pktrieu> Hey guys just looking through a couple chat APIs/SDKs and wondering if this or pusher chatkit is better?
[2018-10-26 08:59:04] <jfet97> interesting
[2018-10-29 15:57:05] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @arunkumar413You can track [<-ISSUE->]

[2018-10-29 15:59:39] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @ryantcassidyIt is expected to have no confirmation but it would be nice if there was a confirmation. Please create an issue, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-10-29 16:17:04] <nvzard> Hey, I was trying to use the API to get the list of room members and by default only 30 members are returned so I used thelimitparameter.Since I want the list of all the members in the room I triedGET /v1/rooms/:roomId/users?limit={no_of_users}but noticed that it returns a list of maximum 100 users only, even when{no_of_users}> 100Is there any way I can get the list of all the users in a room?

[2018-10-29 16:35:41] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @17BunnyJust ask your question. Don't ask to ask
[2018-10-29 16:37:21] <MadLittleMods>  October 20, 2018 12:40 PM @erkanisik1 I am not sure what you are trying to do but there isn't a way to embed your own code into Gitter.Perhaps I am misunderstanding and you want to add the Gitter chat to your contact form page. Sidecar works great for that, https://sidecar.gitter.im/
[2018-10-29 16:41:32] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @miigotuI think server password is the only way to authenticate with the IRC-bridge. Merge request welcome, [<-LINK->]

[2018-10-29 16:53:08] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @dalefrancis88You can track [<-ISSUE->] (cc@rostrander_gitlab)
[2018-10-29 16:54:25] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @gdejohnWhat URL slug are you trying to use for your community? We also reserve names from GitHub so if you were trying to create a community calledprocrastination, [<-LINK->] already exists on GitHub and is reserved
[2018-10-29 16:54:58] <gdejohn> Yeah, I was trying to create a community calledprocrastination.
[2018-10-29 16:55:04] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @pktrieuSorry, I don't have knowledge about pusher chatkit. Gitter API docs are here, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-10-29 17:00:03] <gdejohn> MadLittleMods: So the issue is that there's a GitHub user named "procrastination", so that's reserved on Gitter, but they're not using Gitter, and that's why it 404s?
[2018-10-29 17:02:04] <MadLittleMods> gdejohn: Correct. There is an issue to track having a better message, [<-LINK->] . Merge request welcome
[2018-10-29 17:02:31] <gdejohn> MadLittleMods: Should it be possible to make a room linked to my repo under my name on Gitter? I can't seem to figure it out.
[2018-10-29 17:02:57] <MadLittleMods> gdejohn: Yes, create thegdejohncommunity first, then aprocrastinationroom under that community
[2018-10-29 17:08:33] <gdejohn> MadLittleMods: I guess I've already created thegdejohncommunity, because it says its taken. I can visit gitter.im/gdejohn, and it seems to be an empty community associated with my account. But when I try to create a room and specify the community,gdejohndoesn't come up as an autofill option, and typing it in manually and then trying to create it doesn't work. It just says, "Please select a community."
[2018-10-29 17:24:48] <gdejohn> MadLittleMods: *I can visit gitter.im/gdejohn/home, and it seems to be an empty community associated with my account.
[2018-10-29 17:31:18] <MadLittleMods> @gdejohn The community admin list is mostly populated by your room membership. There is an issue to add user communities to the list in any case, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1830I re-created the lobby room that you can join and create your desired room, https://gitter.im/gdejohn/Lobby
[2018-10-29 17:34:29] <gdejohn> MadLittleMods: Thanks, I was able to create the room. Do I need to keep the lobby room, or can I safely delete it?
[2018-10-29 17:37:09] <MadLittleMods> gdejohn: If you have another room now, you should be good to delete the lobby room

[2018-10-29 18:06:39] <dalefrancis88> hahaha@MadLittleModsthanks for the tip but that was created 4 years ago, i doubt it'll be getting done :)
[2018-10-29 18:09:20] <MadLittleMods> @dalefrancis88 :) It's on the roadmap nowadays (still a while out though) but we also welcome a community merge requestreference,  October 29, 2018 11:53 AM
[2018-10-29 18:09:44] <dalefrancis88> this is opensource?
[2018-10-29 18:09:50] <dalefrancis88> cool didn't know that
[2018-10-29 18:10:01] <MadLittleMods> dalefrancis88: Yep, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-10-29 18:10:54] <dalefrancis88> nice, will check it out
[2018-10-29 18:34:48] <yyyc514> why does Gitter require discrete graphics card on Mac?
[2018-10-29 18:34:53] <yyyc514> is tehre a way to disable that?
[2018-10-29 18:35:19] <yyyc514>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-10-29 18:35:50] <MadLittleMods> yyyc514: See [<-ISSUE->] 
[2018-10-29 18:36:49] <yyyc514> thanks!
[2018-10-29 18:39:15] <yyyc514> wait what is 3.1 and 4.1
[2018-10-29 18:39:21] <yyyc514> i have 1.7x and it’s telling me it’s the latest
[2018-10-29 18:40:18] <yyyc514> 1.17 that is, which is what the website still seems to have for download
[2018-10-29 18:40:37] <yyyc514> so what is [<-LINK->] 
[2018-10-29 18:40:42] <MadLittleMods> yyyc514: 1.7x is the latest we officially ship for macOS and is Safari backed. But unsigned versions of 4.x are available (NW.js backed)
[2018-10-29 18:41:10] <yyyc514> is it OSS and people are just recompiling it then or what?
[2018-10-29 19:47:56] <MadLittleMods> yyyc514: Two separate apps and the Safari-backed 1.7x version is closed source. The NW.js backed version isn't pushed to macOS users only because the auto-update process isn't very smooth
[2018-10-29 21:58:05] <yyyc514> oh is the NW.js app the official app for non Mac users?
[2018-10-29 21:58:08] <yyyc514> MadLittleMods: 
[2018-10-29 21:59:34] <MadLittleMods> yyyc514: The Safari 1.7x based app is the latest macOS app we push to users
[2018-10-29 22:00:05] <yyyc514> oh no safari on windows… so the NW.js app rules the day there?
[2018-10-29 22:01:35] <MadLittleMods> @yyyc514 Sorry, mis-read.The NW.js 4.x app is the latest for Windows and Linux
[2018-10-29 22:03:42] <yyyc514> ok so they are both official in their own ways :)
[2018-10-29 22:03:54] <yyyc514> i might try the 4.x version on mac just to see how it behaves
[2018-10-29 22:42:25] <yyyc514> oh great
[2018-10-29 22:42:26] <yyyc514> no better
[2018-10-29 22:42:41] <yyyc514> it stills wants the discrete graphics
[2018-10-29 22:43:06] <yyyc514> wonder if i'm missing something?
[2018-10-30 14:58:13] <nullchinchilla> Is there any way to set a logo for a community that's not linked to a GitHub repo?
[2018-10-30 14:58:39] <nullchinchilla> Or access settings for that community in any way? It seems like there are only room settings but no community control panel??
[2018-10-30 15:22:31] <kdheepak> Hi all. If I have a public room that I am the admin for and want to make it private, how do I go about doing that?
[2018-10-30 15:39:11] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @nullchinchillaYou can upload a community avatar by clicking on the avatar in the chat header
[2018-10-30 15:39:50] <MadLittleMods> If you are looking for community permissions, go to the room permissions ->Edit community permissionsin the bottom-left. There aren't really any other settings to change
[2018-10-30 15:40:09] <nullchinchilla> MadLittleMods: Thanks!
[2018-10-30 15:41:57] <thecoderkd> Hey!
[2018-10-30 15:42:08] <thecoderkd> The gitter app on android is really really buggy
[2018-10-30 15:42:12] <thecoderkd> and lacks a lot of features
[2018-10-30 15:49:30] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @kdheepakSee [<-LINK->] 
[2018-10-30 15:49:45] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @thecoderkdWhat bugs are you seeing? What features do you expect?
[2018-10-30 16:30:41] <kdheepak> Thanks for the reply!
[2018-10-31 00:21:53] <jasonish> At some pointed I started a private chat with the wrong personal and I can’t remove them from my chats? Is it possible?
[2018-10-31 01:27:44] <MadLittleMods> jasonish: You can only hide a one to one room. In the left-menu, use the...menu -> Hide
[2018-11-01 12:36:18] <OXINARF> Is anyone aware of Gitter certificate being revoked ( [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-01 13:44:42] <mostlydev_gitlab> Hi there.  I’ve signed into gitter using the wrong account (gitlab) instead of github.  How do I log out?
[2018-11-01 13:44:49] <mostlydev_gitlab> I’m on MacOS, on the “native” app
[2018-11-01 13:45:58] <mostlydev_gitlab> I’ve tried deleting~/Library/Application Support/Gitterand~/Library/Preferences/com.troupe.gitter.mac.Gitter.plist
[2018-11-01 13:46:57] <orar> have you tried using the signout link at the top left
[2018-11-01 13:47:15] <mostlydev_gitlab> I don’t see one…  in any of the corners
[2018-11-01 13:47:27] <mostlydev_gitlab> That would have been the most obvious.  Am I partially blind?
[2018-11-01 13:47:46] <orar> there is no Gitter dropdown at the top left?
[2018-11-01 13:48:03] <mostlydev_gitlab> Top left:
[2018-11-01 13:48:08] <mostlydev_gitlab>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-01 13:48:14] <mostlydev_gitlab> Top right:
[2018-11-01 13:48:19] <yyyc514> ugh
[2018-11-01 13:48:39] <mostlydev_gitlab> Ooops
[2018-11-01 13:49:20] <mostlydev_gitlab>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-01 13:49:35] <mostlydev_gitlab> I tried Delete Account, three times.  Checked the box, it just goes back to home.
[2018-11-01 13:49:47] <mostlydev_gitlab> I guess i can delete it on the web site?
[2018-11-01 13:50:40] <mostlydev_gitlab> Web site has a Sign Out link….
[2018-11-01 13:51:45] <mostlydev_gitlab> So, deleting the account on the web put the App in some odd state.  Closed, re-opened, and it’s back with the “deleted” account.
[2018-11-01 13:52:33] <mostlydev_gitlab> Going to try 1) Closing the app, 2) Deleting on web 3) Clearing those two files/folders 4) Running again.
[2018-11-01 13:53:30] <orar>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-01 13:54:05] <orar> that
[2018-11-01 13:54:41] <mostlydev_gitlab> What am I not seeing in that image?
[2018-11-01 13:55:19] <mostlydev_gitlab> There’s no Sign Out link there.   Also, i just did what i said, and deleted the .app for good measure.  No dice.
[2018-11-01 13:55:34] <orar> So it works now?
[2018-11-01 13:55:36] <mostlydev_gitlab> No
[2018-11-01 13:55:43] <mostlydev_gitlab> Still signed in.  Where does it get the UID?
[2018-11-01 13:55:59] <mostlydev_gitlab> Or token, or whatever.
[2018-11-01 13:56:00] <orar> I have no idea on that
[2018-11-01 13:57:26] <mostlydev_gitlab> Ah, there’s also Saved Application States and Caches.  I’ll delete those
[2018-11-01 13:59:08] <mostlydev_gitlab> LOL.  Neither works
[2018-11-01 13:59:18] <orar> lol
[2018-11-01 13:59:24] <mostlydev_gitlab> It’s indestructible!
[2018-11-01 13:59:50] <mostlydev_gitlab> Going to trace the process see what it touches
[2018-11-01 13:59:51] <orar> There cant be an app without signout.. Maybe you gotta search harder
[2018-11-01 14:00:20] <mostlydev_gitlab> I think they turned it off for the “native app"
[2018-11-01 14:00:33] <mostlydev_gitlab> Maybe i can see what it calls on the web and call it using the dev console.
[2018-11-01 14:01:10] <orar> Im actually using a snap. if there may be differences
[2018-11-01 14:06:01] <mostlydev_gitlab> Opened up an issue on GitLab.
[2018-11-01 14:06:07] <mostlydev_gitlab> Maybe i need to run from source or something.
[2018-11-01 14:06:56] <mostlydev_gitlab> Would only be appropriate for an app intended for devs.
[2018-11-01 14:07:00] <mostlydev_gitlab> Thanks for trying.
[2018-11-01 14:30:29] <mostlydev> So, I found the problem
[2018-11-01 14:30:54] <mostlydev> There is a sign out link only when you show the app in the menu bar.  When you uncheck that box, you have no way to sign out.
[2018-11-01 15:18:16] <MadLittleMods> mostlydev: Followed up here, [<-ISSUE->] 
[2018-11-01 15:18:32] <yyyc514> ok why am i getting pinged on these things?
[2018-11-01 15:18:34] <yyyc514> can i turn this off?
[2018-11-01 15:20:14] <MadLittleMods> yyyc514: See [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-01 15:25:53] <yyyc514> yeah i thought i had set it
[2018-11-01 15:25:57] <yyyc514> lets see if it works now
[2018-11-01 15:26:14] <MadLittleMods> yyyc514: What are your current settings? What are you expecting?
[2018-11-01 19:02:40] <mstellaluna> Hello, not sure if this is an issue with gitter  where avast keeps popping this up. I wasn't able to access gitter via MS Edge this morning due to an out of date TLS certificate but is now working, but this pop up won't stop..
[2018-11-01 19:02:47] <mstellaluna>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-01 19:04:24] <mstellaluna> this appears to only happen if im now logged into gitter when in MS Edge but not chrome
[2018-11-01 19:42:14] <cbj4074> mstellaluna: That's interesting. That domain looks to use a wildcard certificate that is current and valid, so not sure to what certificate Avast is referring there.
[2018-11-01 19:42:31] <cbj4074> Have you accessed Gitter in Edge before today?
[2018-11-01 19:42:46] <cbj4074> (tried clearing all relevant caches?)
[2018-11-01 19:42:49] <mstellaluna> always, its my primary browser I use
[2018-11-01 19:43:25] <mstellaluna> and it doesn't seem to be switching rooms correctly either.. I can click on any of the rooms I am in .. but still see the contents of this one even though the room header changed to reflect the new one
[2018-11-01 19:43:59] <mstellaluna> nor did I get an alert you mentioned me.. I did get one though from the mobile app but not through MS Edge@cbj4074
[2018-11-01 19:45:42] <cbj4074> mstellaluna: I would expect there to be some error output in Edge's Console in relation to the behavior... have you checked there?
[2018-11-01 19:46:50] <mstellaluna> cbj4074: yes .. adding a screenshot
[2018-11-01 19:46:54] <mstellaluna>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-01 19:47:49] <MadLittleMods> @mstellaluna We just renewed the cert but the old one should be good until 2018-11-15. There have been a couple other reports where people are seeing it as invalid, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/5299#note_113883383 [<-CODE->] 
[2018-11-01 19:48:45] <mstellaluna> MadLittleMods: thanks for letting me know. i wasn't sure if it was just me or not.  i'll switch over to chrome in the meanwhile since I am not having the issue there.
[2018-11-01 21:10:53] <MadLittleMods> @mstellaluna Are you still seeing issues?Some progress https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure/issues/5299#note_113935124
[2018-11-01 21:31:03] <mstellaluna> MadLittleMods: So far no, no pop ups from Avast. I am able to change rooms with the content refreshing properly
[2018-11-01 21:49:27] <MadLittleMods> mstellaluna: Thanks for the feedback :slight_smile:
[2018-11-01 22:02:34] <mstellaluna> MadLittleMods: Confirmed, It is resolved for me now. thank you very much.
[2018-11-01 23:32:02] <daddycardona> did they get rid of free code camp room?
[2018-11-02 01:42:45] <rostrander_gitlab> daddycardona: If google is not misleading me, Free code camp gitter is [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-02 01:44:03] <pdurbin> yeah, you haven't been misled

[2018-11-02 17:29:47] <cbj4074> craigmaloney: I wonder if that's related to the issues raised yesterday (just a screen or two above your comment)
[2018-11-02 17:30:06] <MadLittleMods> @craigmaloney We did just update our SSL certI just tested and was able to connect with IRCCloud
[2018-11-02 19:37:36] <craigmaloney> I'm still unable to connect via the latest Weechat
[2018-11-02 19:38:48] <craigmaloney>  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-02 19:57:01] <MadLittleMods> @craigmaloney I am able to connect with IRCCloud, HexChat, and Weechat.Perhaps you need to clear some sort of cache that holds that fingerprint
[2018-11-02 19:57:34] <pdurbin> pdurbin: connects from weechat too
[2018-11-02 19:57:55] <MadLittleMods> craigmaloney: It looks like you can update the fingerprint, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-02 19:59:11] <craigmaloney> That looks more like overriding the fingerprint rather than updating it.
[2018-11-02 20:00:57] <craigmaloney> hurm. Looks like I overrode that before. i'm noticing a fingerprint signature in my sec.conf file under Weechat.
[2018-11-02 20:01:26] <craigmaloney> craigmaloney: whistles a jaunty tune while deleting that line and seeing if this works now.
[2018-11-02 20:01:53] <craigmaloney> Nope. Still doesn't like it.
[2018-11-02 20:02:00] <craigmaloney> Looks like I'm going to have to override it again
[2018-11-02 20:07:58] <craigmaloney> OK, it looks like setting the fingerprint did the trick
[2018-11-02 20:08:05] <craigmaloney> not sure why that's the case.
[2018-11-02 20:17:41] <craigmaloney> Thank you, though. Glad it's working again.
[2018-11-02 21:40:27] <bashfulrobot> Hi there, just popping in to check on something. Last year we had moved away from Gitter due to the fact that we could not force notifications to mobile regardless of the desktop status. has anything changed there? Can you ensure that the desktop client does not gobble up mobile notifications?
[2018-11-02 22:43:40] <MadLittleMods> @bashfulrobot No change, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1846Merge request welcome (presence and push notification generator)
[2018-11-02 22:46:20] <bashfulrobot> I do not have the know how.  :-)  Thanks for the additional info. Appreciated.

[2018-11-04 22:06:26] <asarkar> Hi, it seems that all rooms pick up the icon of the community. It'd be nice if the icon for a room could be different from that of the community.
[2018-11-05 01:40:18] <rakhi2104> Why do chat rooms go to the top once they are opened in Gitter for mobile ?
[2018-11-05 02:24:22] <pdurbin> Good question. I've noticed this too.
[2018-11-05 15:39:50] <alexandred> is there a way to see room statistics such as number of messages and analytics stats (traffic etc) ?
[2018-11-05 15:41:05] <pdurbin> Another good question. If you figure out how, please let us know.
[2018-11-05 16:20:53] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @arch-lordI can't see the screenshot. What room are you trying to create (community and room name)? Validation failed comes from a [<-LINK->] . The few 400's I see on the backend for that endpoint are not providing any URL
[2018-11-05 16:24:49] <MadLittleMods>  November 3, 2018 12:57 PM @ghost~5abfdf0bd73408ce4f93e6dc @arch-lord  There is an app and chat context. The the chat iframe is embedded in the app context.It was before my time but it might of been done so that we can use the chat frame in the mobile apps embedded view. Perhaps some URL routing reasons.The goal is to get rid of the iframe barrier soon, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1987
[2018-11-05 16:27:45] <MadLittleMods>  November 4, 2018 9:08 AM @2HexGFX_twitter We should discuss further in https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/apiSee these API docs for joining a room, https://developer.gitter.im/docs/rooms-resource#join-a-room
[2018-11-05 16:28:17] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @batzenYou can also read the docs around it here, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-05 16:32:03] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @asarkarYou can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2018-11-05 16:36:25] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @rakhi2104@pdurbinRooms are ordered bylastAccessTimewhich is updated when read an unread, send a message, websocket connection, etc
[2018-11-05 16:36:52] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @alexandred@pdurbinYou can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2018-11-05 17:40:13] <pdurbin> Thanks. Seems like an odd ordering to me. Maybe it should be configurable. Good to know about the stats issue too.
[2018-11-05 17:49:12] <MadLittleMods> pdurbin: If you want to manually order, you can favorite rooms and drag them around how you want
[2018-11-05 17:50:21] <pdurbin> Cool, but not from the Android client, it looks like.
[2018-11-05 17:51:42] <MadLittleMods> pdurbin: Issue/Merge Request welcome, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-05 17:52:33] <pdurbin> Thanks, I'll think some more about how important it is to me.
[2018-11-05 19:47:24] <asarkar> MadLittleMods:  [<-ISSUE->] been open for 3 years, is there any point in tracking it? Seems like it's on a "won't do" list
[2018-11-05 20:03:21] <MadLittleMods> asarkar: It's worth tracking so people can stay up to date and not have to continually ask if any progress has been made. We can also track any discussion around the feature for implementation later. It's more a case of our priorities never including it. If you are interested in contributing it, we welcome community merge requests
[2018-11-05 23:04:23] <MadLittleMods> Heads-up, we're looking for another Gitter developer, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-08 20:52:31] <pdurbin> serve gitter? what does that mean?
[2018-11-08 20:55:04] <pdurbin> phew
[2018-11-08 22:03:29] <MadLittleMods> pdurbin: Context? What do you mean?
[2018-11-08 22:14:12] <smrsan76> Hi everybody ...
[2018-11-08 22:14:14] <smrsan76> How
[2018-11-08 22:14:44] <smrsan76> can I use new lines in my messages ?!
[2018-11-08 22:15:53] <smrsan76> is any body here ?!
[2018-11-08 22:18:22] <smrsan76> Oh, I've just got it ...
[2018-11-08 22:19:31] <smrsan76> I should switch to compose mode ... lol
[2018-11-08 22:27:16] <pdurbin> Nevemind. He or she deletethe message. Something about serving gitter from react.
[2018-11-08 22:37:30] <kognise> MadLittleMods: I was creating a room in the communityThe X Project. I was trying to call the roomx.
[2018-11-08 23:43:19] <MadLittleMods> ^ reference: https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter?at=5be06de5995818347ba950e7 [<-CODE->] 
[2018-11-08 23:52:09] <pdurbin> MadLittleMods: I floated the idea of using Gitter to folks in IRC but unfortunately I didn't get much enthusiasm: [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-08 23:52:23] <pdurbin> "Gitter is far from usable. Used it for a project. Unstable UI, unusable apps losing messages and notifications, overall a very unpleasant XP"
[2018-11-08 23:52:31] <pdurbin> Is any of that fair?
[2018-11-08 23:53:42] <pdurbin> Later that day (yesterday) at lunch I asked a friend about Gitter and he said he used it a bit because it was used by a project and it was fine.
[2018-11-08 23:54:03] <MadLittleMods> @pdurbin The mobile apps aren't the greatest and they were probably running into gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1846 with notifications.Curious what instability they saw with the UI of just the normal browser/desktop client though. It works pretty well
[2018-11-08 23:54:48] <pdurbin> Later in that IRC log you can see him saying (about Gitter) "I had some bad experience back in April with it... I would be glad to try again..."
[2018-11-08 23:56:04] <MadLittleMods> pdurbin: If you can get some more details on the specific showstoppers they experienced, I'm interested
[2018-11-08 23:57:44] <pdurbin> Sure, I doubt it'll be very hard to get him to jump in here to give feedback directly. If that's helpful.
[2018-11-08 23:58:36] <MadLittleMods> pdurbin: 
[2018-11-09 00:01:14] <pdurbin> How's the hiring going? I know you only posted that job here the other day. I let a friend know about it.
[2018-11-09 00:06:48] <MadLittleMods> pdurbin: Thanks for spreading the word . It's my first time being involved in the hiring process. Difficult to know for sure whether you have a good candidate to pass along the pipeline. We could use some more candidates
[2018-11-09 00:09:54] <pdurbin> Sure. Good help is hard to find, as they say. :) I'd throw my hat into the ring but I'm sort of in my dream job already and I'm nervous about remote and I don't know Javascript that well. But I want Gitter to succeed! :)
[2018-11-09 01:27:03] <kognise> I’d love to help but I’m slightly underage... I’ll stick to PRs
[2018-11-09 02:38:14] <pdurbin> Yeah, I'd like to make aPR or two here and there as time allows.
[2018-11-09 08:17:49] <azol> Hello guys, a simple question I guess. I'm using desktop app (macOS). Unable to find "log out" function :) Any way to log out to switch to another user?
[2018-11-09 09:08:11] <MadLittleMods> azol: The sign out option is in under the menu bar dropdown icon in the top-right, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-09 09:24:42] <azol> MadLittleMods: oh! not easy to find :)
[2018-11-09 13:07:21] <pdurbin> Are there any other chat systems like Gitter that are public by default with logs that are publicly visible without login?
[2018-11-09 13:26:52] <mcarpenterjr> pdurbin: What's you use case? Would it be worth while to process the log files and then render a webpage? Gitter is pretty unique in my eyes.
[2018-11-09 13:37:46] <pdurbin> mcarpenterjr: my use case is open source projects that want the transparency of mailing lists with public archives but for chat. Gitter seems perfect for this. Does that make sense?
[2018-11-09 13:52:11] <mcarpenterjr> Yes Totally.
[2018-11-09 13:55:04] <pdurbin> I agree that Gitter feels unique but I'm thinking that Gitter can't be the only chat system that's public by default like this. Or is it really the only one?
[2018-11-09 13:57:59] <mcarpenterjr> Only one that just works that I've come accross, You ever look at Matrix/irc only thing I've come across that's similar.
[2018-11-09 14:09:51] <pdurbin> Yeah, I was just looking at Riot/Matrix earlier in the week and it's possible to see the public logs but there's quite a large "This is a preview of this room" banner at the top that takes up so much vertical space on my laptop that it's hard to see the messages.
[2018-11-09 14:12:13] <mcarpenterjr> Yea that's annoying, and if memory serves right there's only a limited number of messages you can view.
[2018-11-09 14:17:37] <pdurbin> That was my experience in the past too but it seems like you can scroll back pretty far now. But it's somewhat exhausting to scroll back. If there's an equivalent URL in Riot/Matrix for a particular day like there is in Gitter (i.e. [<-LINK->] ), I haven't found it.
[2018-11-09 14:32:17] <pdurbin> I'm asking at [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-09 15:02:59] <eSilverStrike> With Github removing email notifications by Jan 2019 on repositories for activities like commits I have to find another way to be notified of any changes to a repository I contribute too so I can review, etc... I was hoping Gitter had a way to be notified of changes in the activity feed of a room. As far as I can tell notifications only happen for messages. Is there a plan notifications for activities?
[2018-11-09 15:04:57] <mcarpenterjr> You have an article that claims this? googled "Github removing email notifications" and I got nothing.
[2018-11-09 15:08:46] <eSilverStrike> Not all notifications. GitHub services is being discontinued with the pre-built Email integration (which allowed you to receive notifications on changes to a repository). [<-LINK->] Functionality will be removed from GitHub.com on January 31st, 2019.
[2018-11-09 16:31:51] <mcarpenterjr> eSilverStrike: I think this is what you're looking for, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-09 16:36:35] <pdurbin> mcarpenterjr: I have a little follow up to our "public by default" conversation. I just opened an issue called "URL for an arbitrary day of history and navigation for next and previous days" (feedback welcome!) at [<-ISSUE->] 
[2018-11-09 16:41:12] <mcarpenterjr> pdurbin: thanks man, I'll have to follow along this might prove usefule down the road.
[2018-11-09 16:48:01] <pdurbin> Sure. As I said in the issue. Gitter gets this right.
[2018-11-09 16:52:18] <mcarpenterjr> I was slightly concerned when gitter was absorbed into gitlab that it would replace mattermost, but it's becoming clearer and clearer each solves a completely different problem, while both fit into the communication tool category both do 2 completely different things.
[2018-11-09 17:02:05] <eSilverStrike> mcarpenterjr: Thanks for the link.  It may be easier for me to setup a Github webhook that runs a custom php script to send the emails (that I would have to build since I can't seem to find one). I was hoping there was an easy way via the Gitter interface that I could for a room, setup email notifications for my user  not only for messages but for activities as well. I already have a Gitter room setup that shows all the Github activities of a repository.
[2018-11-09 17:10:38] <pdurbin> mcarpenterjr: makes sense. I think of Mattermost as one of many extremely similar chat solutions. Gitter is different with its embrace of transparent communication. It pairs nicely with open source projects on GitHub or GitLab.
[2018-11-09 17:39:41] <pdurbin> I just submitted an idea for a talk about this: [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-09 18:27:55] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @eSilverStrikeNo plans to support notifications for integration activity
[2018-11-09 18:44:45] <pdurbin> Is there a way to get a sense of which rooms on Gitter are somewhat active?
[2018-11-09 18:44:59] <mcarpenterjr> eSilverStrike: 
[2018-11-09 18:45:36] <MadLittleMods> pdurbin: You can look at the archive heatmap for an individual room. There isn't a popular/trending list though. [<-LINK->] is the closest
[2018-11-09 18:49:11] <pdurbin> Is there an issue I can track for what I want?
[2018-11-09 18:52:03] <pdurbin> "Trending" or whatever you want to call it? Signs of life.
[2018-11-09 18:52:39] <MadLittleMods> pdurbin:  Looks like it [<-ISSUE->] 
[2018-11-09 18:55:48] <pdurbin> Bookmarked. Thanks. I'd be fine with just a nightly JSON dump of the top 100 most active rooms from the past day. Not sure how hard that query would be. Number of messages per room for the past 24 hours.
[2018-11-09 18:58:40] <pdurbin> If that query were run right now, what would be the count of messages in the past 24 hours for the room that's 100th on the list? 10 messages? 100? 1000?
[2018-11-09 19:02:46] <MadLittleMods> @pdurbin Would be a good candidate for another Looker dashboard, meltano/looker!204We have a DataDog dashboard for new objects (communities, rooms, messages, users, etc) but it isn't public, https://app.datadoghq.com/dash/760607/new-object-stats
[2018-11-09 19:05:21] <pdurbin> Does the dashboard give you a sense of what I'm asking? Where the activity, the chatter has been lately. Which rooms?
[2018-11-09 19:26:25] <pdurbin> That "trending rooms" issue is 4 years old with no comments so maybe I'm an outlier for being interested in this.
[2018-11-09 20:55:36] <mcarpenterjr> You're obviously a Big Data guy, it's cool though.
[2018-11-09 21:10:48] <MadLittleMods> pdurbin: No, just totals but we could generate that kind of thing even for historical data
[2018-11-09 21:57:18] <pdurbin> MadLittleMods: I would say whatever's easiest. Like I said, even just a daily snapshot of the past 24 hours would be interesting.
[2018-11-09 21:59:10] <pdurbin> mcarpenterjr: well, whether or not it's big data, I agree with the sentiment that getting a sense of which rooms are popular would be helpful for new users: [<-ISSUE->] 
[2018-11-09 22:26:17] <MadLittleMods> @pdurbin It was discussed while developing the explore page but didn't really want to contribute to the big rooms getting bigger effectIt's interesting just something we need to be smart about exposing to the user-base
[2018-11-09 22:36:32] <pdurbin> The rich get richer.
[2018-11-10 20:40:20] <pdurbin> It's cool to see how important Gitter is to Jupyter: [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-11 02:34:50] <pitosalas> is there a way to search a Gitter room for messages mentioning me?
[2018-11-11 02:35:42] <pdurbin> Are you logged in?
[2018-11-11 20:41:21] <pitosalas> Yes i was and am now
[2018-11-11 21:30:38] <pdurbin> Huh. Well, if search doesn't work the way you want you should probably open an issue.
[2018-11-11 21:31:04] <pitosalas> i am probably doing it wrong. I want to search for all posts in which I am mentioned.
[2018-11-13 18:32:00] <MadLittleMods> pitosalas: Just search for@pitosalas
[2018-11-14 14:58:13] <pitosalas> MadLittleMods: thanks... that seems to search where I am mentioned, not my own posts, right?
[2018-11-14 17:27:28] <MadLittleMods> @pitosalas Yes, that is what you asked? " search a Gitter room for messages mentioning me" "search for all posts in which I am mentioned" [<-CODE->] 
[2018-11-14 17:59:58] <isiahmeadows> Quick question: how do you get that grayed out text that usually goes "@userwonders about ..." or similar?
[2018-11-14 18:00:24] <MadLittleMods> isiahmeadows: /me foo
[2018-11-14 18:00:35] <isiahmeadows> Okay, thanks!
[2018-11-14 18:00:36] <MadLittleMods> MadLittleMods: wonders about ...
[2018-11-14 18:00:49] <isiahmeadows> So that's/me wonders about
[2018-11-14 18:00:52] <isiahmeadows> isiahmeadows: wonders about
[2018-11-14 18:00:55] <isiahmeadows> Thanks!
[2018-11-14 18:03:12] <isiahmeadows> Also, while I'm here, is there a reason emoji references aren't expanded in links? [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-14 18:03:17] <isiahmeadows> And not

[2018-11-15 13:05:50] <vivek14632> Hello everyone. I have one question related to gitter data. Recently, very limited data was shared on kaggle. Does anyone know if gitter shares any bigger dataset?
[2018-11-15 13:54:12] <iSynaptic> Greetings! Question: I'm trying to create a room that is associated with an existing GitHub repo ( [<-LINK->] ). When I do, the for says the address is not available.  I'm not sure how that can be the case since I cannot find an existing room for this repo.  Is this an issue with Gitter or something else? Thanks!
[2018-11-15 16:13:20] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @vivek14632I am not sure what you mean by dataset? Any message in a public room can be indexed by Google
[2018-11-15 16:18:09] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] You should change the URI or create a community based on the org instead, https://github.com/rust-rocksdb
[2018-11-16 02:21:34] <dorwardv> Hi, I'm trying to use Gitter Desktop  Any thoughts on why the words are not readable? [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-16 02:33:12] <MadLittleMods> dorwardv: Closest known thing is this problem with the latest Windows Insider build, [<-ISSUE->] 
[2018-11-16 02:45:12] <RedBaron2> MadLittleMods: Heads up Build 18282 fixed the blurred text issue in gitter.
[2018-11-16 02:47:00] <dorwardv> It looks like a font issue for  me.  .before [<-LINK->] after [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-16 02:47:30] <dorwardv> but definitely related to latest insider build.  Thanks all
[2018-11-16 02:48:40] <dorwardv> thanks@RedBaron2.  I'll look forward to it.  It's still not available for me.
[2018-11-16 02:49:03] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @RedBaron2Can you comment on the issue with those details so we can close it out?
[2018-11-16 02:49:27] <RedBaron2> sure I can do that
[2018-11-16 02:49:40] <MadLittleMods> dorwardv: If you go to the computed styles tab in devtools, what font is it using when it is messed up?
[2018-11-16 02:50:18] <RedBaron2> where is the issue openned?
[2018-11-16 02:50:32] <MadLittleMods> RedBaron2: Linked just above, [<-ISSUE->] ( [<-CODE->] )
[2018-11-16 02:51:11] <RedBaron2> ok first link didnt go right; I'm on it now
[2018-11-16 02:52:17] <MadLittleMods> RedBaron2:  I assume you are on mobile, and ran into this issue, [<-ISSUE->] ( [<-CODE->] ) (Merge request welcome)
[2018-11-16 02:53:14] <dorwardv> MadLittleMods:  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-16 02:54:02] <MadLittleMods> dorwardv: Select an element with messed up text first, it will have a "Rendered Fonts" section
[2018-11-16 02:55:46] <RedBaron2> MadLittleMods: no the issue I ran into was that you linked to my comment as a url. No big deal 
[2018-11-16 02:56:33] <dorwardv> MadLittleMods:  [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-16 02:57:01] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] Was it ever working fine for you? Anything change in your environment/OS recently?
[2018-11-16 02:59:33] <RedBaron2> Comment done
[2018-11-16 03:00:21] <dorwardv> I have been using it for the past year until the force upgrade due to security issues some months ago.  Since then I was only able to successfully install it today.  Prior to it I got issues with nw.dll.  This was from the debug log last october iirc .  It won't launch gitter at all [<-CODE->] 
[2018-11-16 03:01:58] <MadLittleMods> dorwardv: Which version of Windows are you using?
Are you on a high DPI display?
What language is your OS in?
[2018-11-16 03:05:24] <dorwardv> Which version of Windows are you using? *I'm on windows 10 insider fast ring,  my things in my OS changes frequently
Are you on a high DPI display? *No
What language is your OS in? *US English
[2018-11-16 03:07:34] <MadLittleMods> @dorwardv Definitely seems like the same or highly related to gitlab-org/gitter/desktop#264We can't really do anything if it is a OS problem and @RedBaron2 mentioned it is fixed with Build 18282. Probably best to just use the browser version until thenWorks fine on Windows 10 (stable)
[2018-11-16 03:08:32] <dorwardv> MadLittleMods: no worries.  Thanks
[2018-11-16 16:33:09] <TheAifam5> Hey ho, is there a possibility to use multiple Gitter instances on the desktop app? :D
[2018-11-16 16:35:07] <TheAifam5> Or just ability to switch between accounts
[2018-11-16 17:31:37] <MadLittleMods> @TheAifam5 You can open multiple instances, but they all share the same config/preferences which includes your tokenYou can sign out and sign in with another account but I don't think that is what you are looking for
[2018-11-16 18:06:22] <ryanford-dev> is there a way to ignore/mute chat members?
[2018-11-16 18:07:45] <MadLittleMods> ryanford-frontend: No, you can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2018-11-16 18:09:05] <ryanford-dev> hmm interesting. hope they implement something
[2018-11-16 18:09:08] <ryanford-dev> thanks
[2018-11-16 18:10:19] <ryanford-dev> so in a situation of abuse/harrassment it is strictly on channel moderators to ban someone or the user to avoid the harrasser?
[2018-11-16 18:12:02] <MadLittleMods> @ryanford-frontend You can report the message. After enough reports, the message is removed and even more, the user is banned.But we don't tolerate abuse/harassment so feel free to report it here or send an email to support@gitter.im and we can take care of it
[2018-11-16 18:12:43] <ryanford-dev> ok, well thank you for the response. i will relay the info
[2018-11-16 18:24:16] <pdurbin> Heh, I just installed the Mac app for the first time. I love the maze. :)
[2018-11-16 18:25:11] <TheAifam5> Hey ho, is there a possibility to use multiple Gitter instances on the desktop app? :DIt will be in the future maybe? :D Is there any task already?
[2018-11-16 18:51:29] <MadLittleMods> TheAifam5: Feel free to create an issue about being able to switch between multiple accounts. This would be a more general webapp thing that applies everywhere, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-20 13:20:16] <mcarpenterjr> mohideen: .thasthahir_gitlab try asking in [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-20 17:27:45] <niloc132> I've searched issues and the support docs, but haven't found it yet: is it possible to make a private room public so I can let people self-discover it, or is my only option to delete/archive/rename the room and create a new one?
[2018-11-20 17:43:17] <MadLittleMods> niloc132: See [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-20 17:50:01] <niloc132> excellent, thank you@MadLittleMods
[2018-11-20 20:57:07] <kbrock> Anyone had much success with bots in gitter?
[2018-11-20 21:05:35] <rebolek> What is success? I wrote one, it works fine and is easy to do, but I have no use for it, so I don't use it anymore.
[2018-11-20 22:44:19] <kbrock> rebolek: Google sure is pushing bots for their platform, it has me wondering about what to do for gitter... but yea. probably useless
[2018-11-20 22:48:24] <MadLittleMods> kbrock: FreeCodeCamp had a CamperBot, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-20 22:49:17] <kbrock> MadLittleMods: nice. thanks
[2018-11-20 22:49:48] <kbrock> our team poked at google hangout chat - the markdown support was so lacking that we found ourself back here very quickly. thanks for the great product all
[2018-11-20 22:53:15] <MadLittleMods> kbrock: Thanks for the kind words 
[2018-11-20 23:39:10] <pdurbin> It is a great product. Good job.
[2018-11-21 07:04:18] <vinothvkr> Hi Guys, Hope all great. Guys can you help me remove the repo: [<-LINK->] which was created while create the chat badge. In future we are planning to make it private. Pls help me.
[2018-11-21 08:53:13] <nolash> I can't connect through irc gateway anymore
[2018-11-21 08:53:23] <nolash> just says "connection lost" in my log, no message
[2018-11-21 08:53:28] <nolash> is it turned off?
[2018-11-21 16:59:26] <MadLittleMods> nolash: I am able to connect and send messages. Are still having problems?
[2018-11-21 17:01:34] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @vinothvkr [<-LINK->] has been deleted 
[2018-11-21 17:02:23] <nolash> yep
[2018-11-21 17:02:28] <nolash> MadLittleMods: 
[2018-11-21 17:02:35] <nolash> irc.gitter.im?
[2018-11-21 17:04:28] <vinothvkr> MadLittleMods: thanks a lot!
[2018-11-21 17:11:25] <MadLittleMods> nolash: Yes. I can connect and I don't see any alerts around IRC
[2018-11-21 17:13:30] <nolash> If my IP is banned will  I get a message about it?
[2018-11-21 17:21:50] <MadLittleMods> nolash: You can always access Gitter. Our ban would just not let you send a message
[2018-11-21 17:34:53] <nolash> MadLittleMods: heh so it turns out I updated my github key and thus rather naturally the auth token for irc gitter was updated too. Sorry
[2018-11-21 17:42:43] <cbj4074> At least you have the right avatar today. :D
[2018-11-21 17:47:51] <nolash> cbj4074: in my case that avatar is right every day
[2018-11-21 21:02:55] <blizzow_twitter> how do I connect to gitter using thunderbird's IRC client?
[2018-11-21 21:54:12] <MadLittleMods> blizzow_twitter: See [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-21 21:57:28] <pdurbin> Wow, that's crazy that your can connect to Gitter via Thunderbird via IRC. Neat!
[2018-11-22 16:44:37] <dannycolin> TIL about gitter webapp being Open Source. But I was wondering if it's just the client or also the server that is open source.
[2018-11-22 18:32:48] <MadLittleMods> dannycolin: Thewebapprepo has both server and client, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-22 18:58:55] <dannycolin> MadLittleMods: thanks
[2018-11-22 20:02:34] <7heM1sf3t_twitter> Am I missing something with the mobile app.  I don’t remember what I logged into it with, but whatever it was, it doesn’t appear to be synced with the account that I signed on with from my computer
[2018-11-23 06:58:58] <m1sf3t_gitlab> So I am on seperate profiles... Not that I can't just resign in from the computer but there's not a way to do it on mobile
[2018-11-23 11:27:39] <alehander92> hey, i changed my repo and now it's in an organization(it was in my account before)
[2018-11-23 11:27:49] <alehander92> can i move the chat room too ?
[2018-11-23 11:28:01] <alehander92> (I am the only admin of both)
[2018-11-24 16:26:04] <wdmason> Hello. I just wondered how I might change the avatar for my discussion room? I've been clicking everything I can find and searching the web for the answer, but so far no luck.
[2018-11-24 16:48:49] <wdmason> Actually, nevermind. It fixed itself. Apparently, it loads from the related repo and finally updated itself.
[2018-11-25 22:38:29] <pdurbin> I just attempted to convince some people to stay with Gitter instead of switching to Discord: [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-25 22:44:22] <codyloyd> :D and the link is in the open! lol I guess If I were a big fat jerk I would have a bigger problem with that 
[2018-11-25 22:44:35] <codyloyd> in the end the reason we're leaving is that gitter's bugs are just toooo annoying
[2018-11-25 22:47:32] <pdurbin> codyloyd: oh, hey. Nice to see you here. 
[2018-11-25 22:47:52] <codyloyd> lol 
[2018-11-25 22:48:58] <codyloyd> imo this "i can have a conversation with a stranger and it can be linked without my knowledge" is a little scary.I try to be a nice guy on the internet... and I don't plan to run for office any time soon... but still 
[2018-11-25 22:49:32] <pdurbin> But haven't you just described Twitter?
[2018-11-25 22:50:39] <codyloyd> i spend less time "shooting the breeze"on twitter.. but yeah lol
[2018-11-25 22:52:28] <codyloyd> i mean.. I post a lot more weird and mildly inappropriate gifs on gitter than I do twitter :P
[2018-11-25 22:53:03] <pdurbin> Ah, ok. Twitter is less fun for me these days. I just use it for conferences. Work stuff.
[2018-11-25 22:53:19] <codyloyd> i do get where you're coming from though
[2018-11-25 22:54:49] <pdurbin> Cool. Thanks.
[2018-11-25 22:58:46] <pdurbin> And it sounds like the main improvement to make on the Gitter side is improved search.
[2018-11-25 22:59:42] <arku> ^^^ Totally agree with that.
[2018-11-25 23:00:42] <pdurbin> When Twitter was new someone else built decent search for them. :)
[2018-11-26 16:26:49] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @7heM1sf3t_twitterIf you are on Android, you can sign out via the left menu at the bottom. On iOS, it's in the settings
[2018-11-26 16:30:41] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @m1sf3t_gitlabThere isn't a way to switch profiles quickly. You have to sign out and back in for now. Perhaps creating another Android user on your phone would be faster. Similar inquiry here,   [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-26 16:31:25] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @alehander42See [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-26 16:33:24] <MadLittleMods> codyloyd: @pdurbin@arun1595You can track [<-LINK->] and [<-LINK->] for better search
[2018-11-26 16:35:48] <arku> MadLittleMods: Cool, looking forward to updates on the feature!
[2018-11-26 16:50:48] <pdurbin> Thanks, there's also this issue I opened about search: [<-ISSUE->] 
[2018-11-26 22:59:03] <burnsjake> How do I stop the android gitter app, or any gitter client from sending me messages that there are unread messages in the gitter lobby. How f'ing annoying.
[2018-11-26 23:00:23] <MadLittleMods> burnsjake: You can adjust your notification settings, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-11-26 23:00:50] <MadLittleMods> You probably want to use "Mute"
[2018-11-29 07:36:35] <macdasi> How can I find a reply maid for me in a room ?
[2018-11-29 07:38:14] <macdasi> Using the mobile version, someone commented me and I want to find this comment again.
[2018-11-29 07:42:30] <MadLittleMods> @macdasi There isn't message search on mobile (only room search)Feel free to create an issuehttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-android-app/issues
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-ios-app/issues
[2018-12-01 10:48:49] <erkanisik1> HelloIn the rooms do not appear online, we can see what is online.
[2018-12-01 15:17:17] <grg124> hey i am new to gitter
[2018-12-01 15:17:37] <grg124> i wanna know a room for C++ programming
[2018-12-01 15:17:52] <grg124> +competitive programming practices
[2018-12-01 15:40:10] <pdurbin> I recently heard that [<-LINK->] is a good place to talk about C++. I heard that at [<-LINK->] 
[2018-12-01 15:40:52] <pdurbin> GaurangBansal: but maybe there are C++ channels on Gitter too. Not sure.
[2018-12-01 15:41:10] <pdurbin> congthanhsem: with a book, I guess.
[2018-12-01 18:39:20] <MadLittleMods> GaurangBansal: @pdurbinYou can try [<-LINK->] for C++
[2018-12-01 18:39:55] <pdurbin> Ah, good to know. Thanks.
[2018-12-01 18:40:30] <pdurbin> I'm still curious about which Gitter rooms are popular. Which have the most activity. Will we ever be able to know?
[2018-12-01 19:01:19] <pdurbin> I guess I'll keep waiting for [<-ISSUE->] :)
[2018-12-02 02:01:03] <arku> Hey @MadLittleMods I would like to contribute to Gitter. Do you mind pointing me to some starter issues for me to get started?Thanks in advance!
[2018-12-02 05:21:16] <nafg> arun1595: did you see the big orange We're Hiring button? ;)
[2018-12-02 06:02:18] <7heM1sf3t_twitter> MadLittleMods: ok i see it.  I'm on ios.  You can't just make that setting to where it could stay on or off?  Still I don't really need it, I only created a second account because I forgot about the first.
[2018-12-02 07:22:19] <nafg> RichGriese: is something stopping you from making a bot that does that?
[2018-12-02 07:22:24] <nafg> Also, why is that important?
[2018-12-02 12:57:38] <pdurbin> RichGriese: Gitter definitely lets you delete messages that are spam, for example. I think the philosophy is to keep the nice chatter.
[2018-12-02 14:07:55] <pdurbin> Sure, I understand. How do you feel about Twitter? It's sort of like chat but it's not ephemeral by design.
[2018-12-02 14:20:56] <pdurbin> There's a lot to unpack there. Is there more than one production installation of Gitter out there? Would yours be the second one?
[2018-12-02 14:29:07] <pdurbin> Well, Gitter has been open sourced but I don't know if there is a second or a third installation yet or not. I'd love to see a list of installations.
[2018-12-02 14:31:06] <pdurbin> I guess I'm wondering if you need both the "right to be forgotten" feature and the ability to install Gitter on your own server.
[2018-12-02 14:35:09] <pdurbin> Are you trying to get everyone to agree with you? Is it ok with you if some of us see the value in persisting interesting chatter?
[2018-12-02 14:37:07] <pdurbin> Well, as has been suggested, I assume there's an API that can be used to delete messages. But you said you wouldn't want to code this up (wouldn't or couldn't?) so maybe you could hire someone.
[2018-12-02 14:37:23] <cbj4074> LOL:When I asked if that was possible back then, I was met by incredible hostility, almost stoned for heresy.It's really not an unreasonable position you hold. Surprised it was met with such criticism, especially given GDPR and similar.
[2018-12-02 14:38:06] <pdurbin> No, I was saying I don't know of anyone with an installation of Gitter besides the main installation.
[2018-12-02 14:39:41] <cbj4074> Maybe this has changed, but there was a time that onlysomeof the code had been licensed in a way that would allow for what you're describing. Thewebappmoved to an MIT license, but there were (and may still be) server-side components that are still proprietary.
[2018-12-02 14:40:05] <cbj4074> I think the goal was to make it all MIT or similar, but I'm not sure if that's happened as yet.
[2018-12-02 14:41:43] <pdurbin> Hmm, maybe, but I think enough of Gitter has been open sourced that someone could come along and run their own installation of Gitter. From poking around the code and running it on my laptop, however, it doesn't seem like Gitter was designed from the ground up for easily supporting installations other than the main one. Feature like "branding" or whatever seem missing.
[2018-12-02 14:43:51] <pdurbin> No, youcaninstall your own Gitter. You can try anyway. I tried. On my laptop. It worked. But it's hard to control the branding of the installation, I think.
[2018-12-02 14:44:36] <cbj4074> Interesting, and cool. Maybe somebody will implement "theming" some day.
[2018-12-02 14:44:48] <pdurbin> Yeah, like Wordpress themes.
[2018-12-02 14:47:12] <pdurbin> Wordpress feels designed from the ground up to be installed by lots of people all over the world. Gitter doesn't. It would be great for Gitter to move more toward the Wordpress installation experience. I don't know if there is an issue tracking this or not.
[2018-12-02 14:55:50] <pdurbin> The Gitter roadmap goes through Jan 2020 and has some great features listed but I don't see any epic about increasing the number of Gitter installations around the world, about making it easy to install and customize Gitter for your needs.
[2018-12-03 00:01:22] <vi> How do I change global notification settings when no notification is currently being displayed?For global notifications, click "Configure Defaults" in the bottom-left of the notification modal.It's easy to change per-room notifications, but it's less clear how to change the default. I expected to see some "profile settings" in account menu, but there is none.
[2018-12-03 00:02:11] <vi> There should be "Settings" before "Sign out" and "Delete account" (or even instead of "Delete account").
[2018-12-03 00:21:36] <pdurbin> vi: did you find it? You have to look in any room. It isn't under your account.
[2018-12-03 09:28:24] <vi> Looked again in room notification settings and found "Configure Defaults" link.I mis-read the documentation and though the "notification modal" is the pop-up which appears when there is some message to be notified (there is bottom-left thing there as well).
[2018-12-03 14:21:16] <pdurbin> Sounds like good feedback.
[2018-12-03 17:41:04] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @arun1595Probably best to address something you would like to see added/fixed. Some of the issues withAccepting Merge Requesthave some relevant code links to get you jump started, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-12-03 17:44:45] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @cbj4074I don't have reference to the messages you are responding to but there is a ghost user feature when deleting your account, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-12-03 17:46:16] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @pdurbinWe are focused on the SaaS experience,gitter.im. Self installations is not a route we plan to support but people are free to run their own. There have been a few people who have jumped into it and used the Docker-ized development version
[2018-12-03 17:47:11] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @vi [<-ISSUE->] probably best tracks a proper place for user/notification settings
[2018-12-03 17:47:52] <MadLittleMods> vi: Merge request welcome to better describe where to find the notification defaults at the moment
[2018-12-03 17:48:42] <pdurbin> Ok. So the term you use is "self installation" and you don't plan to support it. Good to know. No issue to track. No epic. Not on the roadmap. Thanks!
[2018-12-03 17:49:18] <MadLittleMods> pdurbin: You can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2018-12-03 17:49:37] <pdurbin> Oh! Thanks.
[2018-12-03 17:51:11] <pdurbin> Is there a list of self installations?
[2018-12-03 18:31:50] <MadLittleMods> pdurbin: No, and I assume most of them are probably internal to their own networks
[2018-12-03 18:44:12] <pdurbin> Ok, thanks!
[2018-12-03 19:43:26] <se5a> I'm having a problem with FireFox + Gitter freezing up linux Mint.  I've tried turning off hardware acceleration in firefox but that does not seem to help.
[2018-12-03 19:44:15] <se5a> the problem does not appear to be present in chrome
[2018-12-03 19:44:26] <MadLittleMods> @se5a Related issue gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#827How reproducible is the problem in Firefox? Any action that causes it to start?
[2018-12-03 19:45:03] <se5a> it apears to happen with new messages in rooms, but not every time.
[2018-12-03 19:45:09] <se5a> I'll chec that out
[2018-12-03 19:46:09] <MadLittleMods> se5a: Are you getting the "unresponsive script" dialog (as seen in that issue)? What line does it point to when you "Debug script"?
[2018-12-03 19:46:34] <se5a> no, the whole laptop freezes up. I have to hard reboot
[2018-12-03 19:47:20] <MadLittleMods> se5a: Are you sure it is a Gitter problem? Do you have any other tabs open? Was it working fine before?
[2018-12-03 19:47:29] <se5a> actualy it's not a complete freeze, the cursor is still active, but not responsive to mouseclicks or keyboard keys
[2018-12-03 19:48:22] <se5a> I'm reasonibly confidant it's a gitter problem since it only happens when I have gitter open in firefox.
[2018-12-03 19:48:37] <se5a> if I have gitter open in chrome the problem never occurs
[2018-12-03 19:49:07] <MadLittleMods> se5a: Was it working fine before? When did it start happening?
[2018-12-03 19:49:44] <se5a> no I've had this problem for a long long time, I've recently just re-installed Mint to a new version and it's still happening.
[2018-12-03 19:50:43] <se5a> I can see if I can ssh in when a freeze happens, but if you've got any ideas to get any extra information from it if that's successful?
[2018-12-03 19:51:59] <se5a> the only extension I have active is ublock
[2018-12-03 19:52:36] <MadLittleMods> @se5a You could also try using the Chrome devtools remote debugging from another machinehttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/20921597/running-chrome-dev-tools-on-different-computer [<-CODE->] 
[2018-12-03 19:53:44] <MadLittleMods> se5a: It looks like Firefox has a similar thing, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-12-03 20:07:30] <se5a> ok I just had it happen on chrome as well, I was able to alt ctrl f1 and then restart cinnamon
[2018-12-03 20:09:48] <se5a> I wonder if it still happens if I turn off notifications
[2018-12-03 21:15:33] <se5a> hasn't yet
[2018-12-03 21:15:40] <se5a> I guess it's something with the notifications then
[2018-12-03 21:19:12] <MadLittleMods> se5a: How did you disable notifications? Browser or in app?
[2018-12-03 21:20:15] <se5a> Room settings -> Notifications -> Configure Default
[2018-12-03 21:20:40] <se5a> I'm not running the app
[2018-12-03 21:20:48] <se5a> it's all browser

Please read the room topic at the top in the chat header and welcome message when joining a room. You can try asking in [<-LINK->] but your question is probably better answered by Google
[2018-12-04 05:56:39] <sairambrandcrock_gitlab> Okay thank you
[2018-12-04 12:05:57] <seanradley> Hi@MadLittleMods. We've been trying to close down our community, but we not pushed it through yet. I believe the owner of the community emailed you to ask that the community be deleted. Would you mind having a look? [<-LINK->] 
[2018-12-04 17:20:56] <MadLittleMods> @seanradley I responded to them on Oct. 29 asking for confirmation, https://gitter.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/9313Can you have them respond to the ticket again?
[2018-12-05 02:32:17] <seanradley> Thanks@MadLittleMods, will do.
[2018-12-05 12:49:23] <kilobite_gitlab> Great to find a central pace where discussions and "opinions" can be posted, unlike StackO #feedbac #praise
[2018-12-05 14:33:14] <pdurbin> kilobite_gitlab: tired of "closed as off topic"? 
[2018-12-05 14:34:07] <alexandred> any plans to update the ios gitter app to support the resolution of the XS max?
[2018-12-05 16:12:24] <MadLittleMods> @alexandred Yes, we need to rebuild and submit to the app store, gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-ios-app#3We are currently working on the Android app CI deploy/submission but want to have the same setup for iOS, gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-android-app!5
[2018-12-05 18:11:12] <alexandred> thanks for the confirmation its in the works!
[2018-12-06 17:08:40] <CaptainMumo> Hello there.. I just came across an issue with Gitter.. it so happens that if I send a message without internet connection, it will be flagged with a red background but once i have the internet connection restored, the message does not get sent but rather disappears to a land of no return!!!
[2018-12-06 17:11:58] <MadLittleMods> @CaptainMumo Please create an issue, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issuesThere is a retry button on messages but I assume if you get another snapshot from the server, it will clear that temporary message
[2018-12-06 17:22:49] <CaptainMumo> MadLittleMods: Okay. Thank you.
[2018-12-07 10:56:52] <reckart> Hey folks. I am looking for information on how to manually set up GitHub integration on a gitter channel - the current instructions do not work anymore as Git has deprecated the services functionality.
[2018-12-07 14:28:02] <nolash> anyone know how to create code render (like between two lines of triple backticks) from irc gateway? Or put differently; what would one have to send on the socket in order to render it like that?
[2018-12-07 17:22:59] <MadLittleMods> nolash: If you can't send multi-line messages from IRC, then you won't be able to make a code block/fence
[2018-12-07 17:23:22] <nolash> MadLittleMods: it's just 0x0a between? I can script it
[2018-12-07 17:25:36] <MadLittleMods> nolash: ♀ try it, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-12-07 17:30:27] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @reckartIt's looks like it is called "Webhooks" now [<-CODE->] 
[2018-12-07 18:06:11] <ansermino> Hey! I'm having some issues creating a community for one of my github organizations. From your documentation I suspect this has to do with the fact I have the public and private repo gitter apps on my user account but only the private repo app on the organization. How can I fix this? Any suggestions?
[2018-12-07 19:03:38] <bagintz> Hello, I get a generic "Validation failed" when I try to add a private room, anyone know where I can find out more about what I am doing wrong?
[2018-12-07 20:12:20] <bagintz> Are you only able to add rooms corresponding to a repo when connected to a github org?
[2018-12-07 20:17:52] <MadLittleMods> bagintz: Can you give some context? What community are trying to create the room under (link it)? What is the name of the room you are trying to create?
[2018-12-07 20:19:05] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @anserminoIf you go to your applications, [<-LINK->] you can grant access  to the org
[2018-12-07 20:52:04] <reckart> MadLittleMods: where do I find the "payload URL"?
[2018-12-07 20:52:24] <reckart> MadLittleMods: I mean : which URL? The dialog on Gitter for manual setup shows a token, but no URL
[2018-12-07 20:53:06] <MadLittleMods> reckart: PressDoneon that step, then in the list you will see the URL
[2018-12-07 20:57:31] <reckart> MadLittleMods: got it, thanks!
[2018-12-07 21:14:38] <ansermino> MadLittleMods: Thank you!
[2018-12-10 04:10:01] <avecchio> Question: Why would I receive the error 'validation failed' when I am trying to create a new room?
[2018-12-10 06:11:06] <kopax> Hi
[2018-12-10 06:11:15] <kopax> How can I create a room for my OSS group ?
[2018-12-10 06:11:46] <kopax> support.gitter.im is down
[2018-12-10 06:13:35] <MadLittleMods> @kopax How is it behaving? http://support.gitter.im redirects to https://gitter.zendesk.com/hc/en-us (just tested, works fine for me)Our docs are focused here now though https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/tree/develop/docs
[2018-12-10 06:14:12] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @avecchioCan you give some context? What community are trying to create the room under (link it)? What is the name of the room you are trying to create?
[2018-12-10 06:15:32] <kopax> It was giving me incorrect certificate, and when I was accepting them, I am ending to a 500 page
[2018-12-10 06:15:43] <kopax> Anyhow, now it is working \

[2018-12-10 06:16:29] <kopax> we are releasing this group opensource, it's our last 2 years of work, we called it bootstrap-styled and it permit people to share theme and components made with styled-components and react
[2018-12-10 06:16:35] <kopax> I was not able to create a gitter for it

[2018-12-10 06:25:39] <kopax> Private Repo Access and Public Repo Access
[2018-12-10 06:26:37] <kopax> MadLittleMods: I have granted access to all my group to gitter
[2018-12-10 06:27:01] <kopax> Repos are public
[2018-12-10 06:27:30] <MadLittleMods> kopax: On the community creation page, do you see your org listed when you click on the "github projects" link?
[2018-12-10 06:28:35] <kopax> I don't
[2018-12-10 06:29:22] <kopax> It sees a lots ofmy reposbut nomy orgs
[2018-12-10 06:30:00] <MadLittleMods> @kopax The steps here best describe what to do, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/faq.md#why-isnt-my-github-organisation-or-repos-appearingMake sure you have public and private scope granted personally and on the org,https://github.com/settings/applications
https://github.com/organizations/bootstrap-styled/settings/applicationsYou can also try making your org membership public,https://github.com/orgs/bootstrap-styled/people
[2018-12-10 06:31:39] <kopax> This link [<-LINK->] 
[2018-12-10 06:31:44] <kopax> Says: No Organization Owned Applications
[2018-12-10 06:31:45] <kopax> Do you want to develop an application that uses the GitHub API? Register an application to generate OAuth tokens.
[2018-12-10 06:32:14] <kopax> This link, show all the OAuth app with access on my account, I've check for private and eveyrthing is granted, and public it has grant for all my orgs
[2018-12-10 06:33:27] <kopax> On this link : [<-LINK->] I do not see how I can make my org membership public
[2018-12-10 06:34:35] <kopax> Oh now it work
[2018-12-10 06:34:36] <kopax> thanks
[2018-12-10 06:34:57] <MadLittleMods> kopax:  glad you got it working
[2018-12-10 06:35:49] <kopax> Thanks MadLittleMods, I think the grant was given on login to all my org, but then in the settings only 1 had the grant, I've added the grand to all again after you give me the link
[2018-12-10 06:36:03] <kopax> I was not able to see the community in the list but when I try to create it, the gitter app was able to allow me
[2018-12-10 14:32:11] <ghost~5a997405d73408ce4f8f9937> Hi, I logged with twitter (handle@KannarFR), but on gitter my handle is@KannarFR_twitterand my twitter profile picture is not available, can you help me?
[2018-12-10 15:21:31] <cbj4074> KannarFr_twitter: Historically, logging-in with Twitter has appended that_twittersuffix. Only if you login with GitHub is there no suffix. Not sure what the issue is with your avatar, but I suspect it will fix itself eventually.
[2018-12-10 16:50:30] <MadLittleMods> KannarFr_twitter: I have manually updated your avatar. May be related to [<-ISSUE->] 
[2018-12-10 16:51:55] <ghost~5a997405d73408ce4f8f9937> Thank you@MadLittleMods. I have to@kannarfron github too, can you do something to change my nickname on gitter to kannarfr too? :D
[2018-12-10 16:52:34] <MadLittleMods> KannarFr_twitter: Nope, just sign in to Gitter with GitHub (there isn't a way to associate the accounts, [<-LINK->] )
[2018-12-10 16:54:25] <ghost~5a997405d73408ce4f8f9937> MadLittleMods: thanks a lot.
[2018-12-12 18:22:33] <MadLittleMods> rayantovi: Please ask your Gitter support question right away. [<-LINK->] 
[2018-12-12 18:56:50] <mforets> Hi, i manage a github organization and we have been using "Github Services" for integration with Gitter. For a newly created project i no longer have this option ("GitHub Services are being deprecated") and i have trouble setting up the webhook. If i go to "Room Settings ->  Integrations -> Add an integration -> Github -> Continue (write access) -> Pick which repositories you want to subscribe to." i dont see the newly created repository, because only the repositories under my personal username are shown,mforets/..and not those of the organizationJuliaReach/... Do you suggest some workaround? Thanks in advance.
[2018-12-12 18:59:52] <mforets> I don't know if i made myself clear -- the repository ishttps://github.com/JuliaReach/MathematicalSets.jl/, and i'm not able to find it in the gitter Room Settings and add it to our room that receives notifications of all repos in the org.
[2018-12-12 19:07:40] <MadLittleMods> mforets: If you don't see your org/repo, run through these steps, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-12-12 19:08:20] <mforets> Thanks! I'll check that.
[2018-12-12 19:09:09] <MadLittleMods> mforets: If you are trying to manually setup the webhook integration, GitHub did change their process which the Gitter UI hasn't been updated for (issue welcome). We had some discussion around it here, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-12-12 19:17:27] <mforets> MadLittleMods: I was able to see my org in gitter following those steps. Thanks, have a nice day!!
[2018-12-13 08:46:20] <aolko>  [<-ISSUE->] 4 months passed, updates?
[2018-12-13 17:13:16] <MadLittleMods> aolko: Nope, updates would be in the issue. As always, merge request welcome (relevant code in description)
[2018-12-13 21:15:23] <MadLittleMods> We have a new release of the Gitter Android app up in the beta release track. Would love some other testers to try it outYou can switch to the beta release track via https://play.google.com/apps/testing/im.gitter.gitterThen uninstall your existing app and install again, https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.gitter.gitterNo features were added, it's just the first release from the open-source repo (we did upgrade to Android API 26), https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-android-app
[2018-12-13 21:15:57] <nafg> MadLittleMods: anything changed at all? Like fixing the notifications maybe? ;)
[2018-12-13 21:16:20] <MadLittleMods> @nafg No changesNo features were added, it's just the first release from the open-source repo
[2018-12-13 21:16:53] <nafg> wasn't sure that would be considered adding a feature, more like fixing a bug...
[2018-12-14 17:37:31] <MadLittleMods> orion00x_twitter: You can use [<-LINK->] or your own room to test things
[2018-12-14 23:53:56] <5ck1dd13> hi
[2018-12-17 21:26:58] <AdmiralSnyder> hi, Does the from:username search need any special syntax to find my username? for example from:MadLittleMods works, from:AdmiralSnyder doesnt. Or does it simply not work with the own username? from:me doesn't work either. How do I see all my posts?
[2018-12-17 21:33:46] <MadLittleMods> AdmiralSnyder: from:AdmiralSnyderworks for me here. Search only looks for messages in the current room. You could be running into [<-ISSUE->] 
[2018-12-17 22:38:41] <AdmiralSnyder> does from:MadLittleMods work for you?
[2018-12-17 22:39:02] <MadLittleMods> AdmiralSnyder: Yes
[2018-12-17 22:56:15] <AdmiralSnyder> anything i can do to help debugging that issue? I'm using Edge on win10, but found no console or network entry with any from: URLs in the F12.
[2018-12-17 22:57:36] <MadLittleMods> AdmiralSnyder: If the ElasticSearch query times out, I am pretty sure it is still a 200 but just no results. Look for requests like this [<-CODE->] 
[2018-12-17 23:02:02] <AdmiralSnyder> there was one HTTP400 quite early on  with only "from:" (while typing I guess), the others are 200s. Shouldn't the elasticsearch timeout respond something? like, empty resultset or error?
[2018-12-17 23:03:45] <MadLittleMods> AdmiralSnyder: From your response, it seems like it is responding with a 200 empty resultset. Am I missing something?
[2018-12-17 23:08:23] <AdmiralSnyder> the response header has connection: keep-alive. i thought this was the initial answer of the elasticsearch meaning "the search has started" and that the timeout you mean would take some more time. it seems like the time for those messages varies from 1.5 to 4 seconds. that doesn't sound like some >x timeout, doesn't it?
[2018-12-17 23:11:18] <MadLittleMods> AdmiralSnyder: It's just a GET request. The Elasticsearch timeout happens in the Gitter internal network and returns you a 200 empty array[]on the API. The response time could vary because there is probably some caching
[2018-12-17 23:12:52] <AdmiralSnyder> then there's not much i can do from here, right?
[2018-12-17 23:16:23] <MadLittleMods> AdmiralSnyder: Not really. If you really want to dive into it, I linked some relevant code here, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-12-17 23:25:00] <AdmiralSnyder> … shouldn't [<-LINK->] be "</m0>" in the first post_tag?
[2018-12-17 23:26:54] <MadLittleMods> AdmiralSnyder: I think so , Good spot! Feel free to create an issue, [<-LINK->] then a merge request to fix it up. If you know the details on how this affects search currently, that would be great to include
[2018-12-17 23:27:48] <AdmiralSnyder> i don't have no clue at all :-) just saw the pattern.
[2018-12-17 23:33:25] <AdmiralSnyder> which branch should i do the merge request against?
[2018-12-17 23:33:43] <MadLittleMods> AdmiralSnyder: develop(should be the default), we use git flow
[2018-12-17 23:45:54] <AdmiralSnyder> well, perhaps that was a little helpful at least (!1303). Thansk. I wonder if something like from:me would be useful for the search...
[2018-12-17 23:47:29] <MadLittleMods> @AdmiralSnyder Thanks for the MR, I assume you didn't mean to close, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp!1303 [<-CODE->] 
[2018-12-17 23:48:14] <AdmiralSnyder> does close mean that the MR is deactivated?
[2018-12-17 23:48:42] <MadLittleMods> AdmiralSnyder: I reopened, should be fine
[2018-12-17 23:50:02] <AdmiralSnyder> close really isn't beginner-friendly for a label. i thought it meant something like "I'm done with creating the merge request, now please, someone else / some system,  do something"
[2018-12-17 23:50:59] <MadLittleMods> @AdmiralSnyder Feel free to create an issue on the GitLab project to give some feedback, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues"Close" is pretty standard ♀ but perhaps there could be better next steps highlighted
[2018-12-18 18:18:36] <arunkumar413> Can we have an option to filter the messages where the user is tagged/ mentioned
[2018-12-18 20:24:30] <MadLittleMods> arunkumar413: You can search for your username@arunkumar413currently. But these issues probably better track what you are after,gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#646
gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1433
[2018-12-19 18:30:55] <nolash> how can I turn off the "who has seen this" for my user? Is there a setting in my profile?
[2018-12-19 19:18:20] <MadLittleMods> nolash: We used to have a lurk setting but that was removed when we simplified notifications a bit, [<-LINK->] 
[2018-12-19 19:19:53] <nolash> So I can't prevent people from seeing my presence then?
[2018-12-19 19:20:24] <UnfamoseHKR666> yeah
[2018-12-19 19:20:45] <nolash> is that the case also when I use the irc gateway?
[2018-12-19 19:21:20] <MadLittleMods> @nolash If the room is public you could view the room while being signed outThe IRC gateway marks any message that passes through it as readby you, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/irc-bridge/blob/4be376c6d58be55683abec0b099f89d2a653a215/lib/gitter-adapter.js#L196
[2018-12-19 19:21:29] <UnfamoseHKR666> But why))?
[2018-12-19 19:22:59] <nolash> Yes, I am also curious about what is the justification for forcing users to reveal their presence?
[2018-12-19 19:23:28] <nolash> I for my partreallydon't like that sort of thing
[2018-12-19 19:27:55] <hazho> but me, opposite, what is the reason someone try to hide what he saw and what he did
[2018-12-19 19:27:57] <hazho> ???
[2018-12-19 19:28:13] <hazho> let's be more honest and more human
[2018-12-19 19:29:48] <nolash> More human is giving each other the freedom of what they want to reveal@hazho. But I doubt anything  fruitful will come out of continuing such a discourse here.
[2018-12-19 19:30:31] <MadLittleMods> @UnfamoseHKR666 @nolash It's less of a case of forcing and more that lurking is gone now. Lurking used to be a notification setting so it was intertwined with which notifications you saw and not just whether you show up in readby. [<-CODE->] Issue welcome, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/irc-bridge/issues
[2018-12-19 19:31:34] <UnfamoseHKR666> MadLittleMods: oh oke
[2018-12-19 19:32:23] <nolash> MadLittleMods: I would appreciate having the choice, yes. Even if it's an opt-in choice of lurk and not opt-out of reveal. And I think it should be global per user. I can add an issue if you like. Thanks.
[2018-12-19 19:33:08] <hazho> nolash: I respect your opinion, but the freadom is not mean that you steal ideas, emotions, thinkings or even cheating your community that you didn't know something in a while you may was the first who knew that ... !
[2018-12-19 19:33:21] <hazho> I know you really know my point
[2018-12-19 19:35:13] <UnfamoseHKR666> Hm... it's so strange discuss about freedoom
[2018-12-19 19:35:45] <nolash> hazho: no I have no idea what you mean by that, but I think an elaborate discussion of this is off-topic here. In any case@MadLittleModshas asked for an issue, which is case closed on the topic for the part of this channel, I believe.
[2018-12-19 19:36:20] <hazho> OK
[2018-12-20 12:02:32] <nolash> MadLittleMods:  [<-ISSUE->] 
[2018-12-22 17:42:24] <mnewt> It is bad practice to have a daemon running all the time, even when I’m not using Gitter. It is called GitterHelperApp. Whatever it is doing, I did not authorize it to do so. If I kill it, it immediately starts up again. How do I stop this? Thanks
[2018-12-22 17:52:14] <pdurbin> I don't see this on Linux. Are you on Windows? Mac?
[2018-12-22 17:53:02] <hazho> on windows 10 pro no such service or app working
[2018-12-22 17:53:42] <mnewt> Mac
[2018-12-22 18:00:06] <pdurbin> I would suggest opening an issue.
[2018-12-22 18:06:49] <mnewt> Will do, thanks

[2018-12-26 14:20:26] <cbj4074> waruqi: It uses the the values from your GitHub profile, so you would need to change them there.

[2019-01-02 16:18:59] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @MynkenIt would have to be separate with a bot but you could setup a script that listened to GitHub events (webhook) and used a Gitter API token to send messages to the Gitter room

[2019-01-08 06:14:02] <jeevatkm> Hello Gitter Team- I have just created a new community name "goresty" for [<-LINK->] .  I would like to change my Gitter username to "go_resty" or "go-resty".  Please help out. Thank you.

[2019-01-08 20:23:21] <mjy> Anyone else experiencing a distruption b/w github notification and gitter?  We're not seeing the last couple of days worth of notifications.
[2019-01-08 21:04:46] <MadLittleMods> mjy: Should be working. I checked out a few other rooms and they have up to date GitHub activity. Check on GitHub to see the timestamp of the last thing they tried to send to the Gitter webhook
[2019-01-08 21:05:23] <mjy> Thanks@MadLittleModsI'll consider it my config issue.
[2019-01-09 10:10:49] <davida2017w_twitter> I'm a bit confused about how to use Gitter. I want to frequently access the Visual Studio community. I marked it as a Favorite but it is not listed in 'ALL CONVERSATIONS' (my other favorites are). Why might that be?
[2019-01-09 15:58:18] <MadLittleMods> davida2017w_twitter: You might have clicked "Hide" on it but visiting the room again should unhide it
[2019-01-09 16:08:31] <davida2017w_twitter> MadLittleMods: I don't think that's the problem. When I visit ' Visual Studio' room and click the Favorite icon, then go somewhere else, then return to ' Visual Studio' room, the Favorite icon is off.  It doesn't seem to be saved.

[2019-01-10 17:55:22] <MadLittleMods> @davida2017w_twitter I figured out the problem. https://gitter.im/Microsoft/VisualStudio only allows GitHub users to join. When you favourite a room, if you haven't joined, it tries to join you which we don't allow because you are a Twitter user.Other notes: [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
[2019-01-10 17:56:00] <MadLittleMods> davida2017w_twitter: The takeaway is that we shouldn't show the favourite star button for people who can't join the room. Mind creating an issue? [<-LINK->] 
[2019-01-11 01:30:27] <x8x> MadLittleMods: Hi, over at [<-LINK->] , the right column ACTIVITY (from github) is stuck at January 7, any clue what could be and how to fix? ( We didn't do any changes on our side! )Also, Github will disable Github services on January 31 , gitter integration is a service so I assume it will stop working soon, what is the suggested update? I cant find a Gitter integration App over at Github. Thank you! 
[2019-01-11 01:39:52] <MadLittleMods> @x8x Someone else mentioned their GitHub activity being stopped,   January 8, 2019 2:23 PM. What does GitHub say is the latest they sent to the webhook?We don't have an integration app on GitHub but I think you could still setup a manual webhook on GitHub. Feel free to create an Issue or even a Merge Request to track the way forward, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues
[2019-01-11 09:04:14] <davida2017w_twitter> MadLittleMods: Thanks for your answer. I will use my GitHub account from now on. I have raised an issue for the favorite star button.

[2019-01-13 14:19:05] <cottrell> Is there some way to change name and avatar?
[2019-01-13 14:19:23] <cottrell> thepublicone I mean
[2019-01-13 14:19:47] <cottrell> issue is that github has not messaging, so it is not susceptible to certain kinds of attacks
[2019-01-13 14:20:09] <cottrell> but gitter is basically nothing but messaging, the entropy is higher and you are exposed to more attackers.
[2019-01-13 14:20:41] <cottrell> so we really need a ghosting layer
[2019-01-13 18:17:28] <MadLittleMods> cottrell: Your username match whatever you have on GitHub, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-01-13 18:23:26] <pdurbin> I haven't observed any attacks. I don't know if this is due to luck or good spam prevention. :)

[2019-01-13 21:05:29] <pdurbin> It seems fine. I only just turned it on.
[2019-01-17 13:58:53] <retorquere> I am getting a 404 error when I try to set up a gitter chat for my GH repo
[2019-01-17 14:51:28] <GregTheGreek> We recently renamed our github repo (1 week ago) and now all our links are broken in our room. IS there anyway to update the room link?
[2019-01-17 16:21:28] <MadLittleMods> GregTheGreek: We can update the repo for your room but if you are talking about the integration activity items, they are baked in and we don't have a script to update them, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-01-17 16:32:25] <MadLittleMods> GregTheGreek: I'll follow-up in your issue, [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-01-17 16:41:07] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @retorquereWhen/Where are you seeing the 404?
Can you link your GitHub repo?
What room on Gitter are you trying to create?
[2019-01-17 17:28:56] <wherkamp> I get a toast Everytime I get a notification from gitter that's how I know someone has said something lol
[2019-01-17 17:31:03] <wherkamp> The toast states the gitter has crashed
[2019-01-17 17:55:05] <MadLittleMods> @wherkamp If you don't want to see the uncaught exceptions (probably fine to ignore), you can turn it off via the Gitter menu -> Notifications -> Show desktop errors,
[2019-01-17 17:56:21] <wherkamp> MadLittleMods: I am on Android?
[2019-01-17 18:12:39] <MadLittleMods> @wherkamp Sounds similar to gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-android-app#114If you can run through the debugging steps there to get some more information about the crash, it would help narrow it down
[2019-01-17 18:13:54] <wherkamp> 404
[2019-01-17 18:16:48] <wherkamp> A crash warning is a nice way of saying you got a message

[2019-01-17 19:36:40] <retorquere> MadLittleMods: I'm trying to set up gitter for [<-LINK->] ; I'm linking in my README to [<-LINK->] . That room should be auto-created based on my repo, right?
[2019-01-17 20:17:13] <MadLittleMods> retorquere: Rooms are not auto-created. You need to create the room yourself [<-CODE->] 
[2019-01-17 21:27:38] <retorquere> MadLittleMods: my bad. I thought my previous room was set up automatically -- perhaps by a bot?
[2019-01-17 21:28:57] <MadLittleMods> retorquere: Room creation is manual so probably not
[2019-01-18 10:12:59] <cmpbiendl> Hey Guys, does someone know if it is possible to change my Display Name here in gitter? I’ve read the documentation and it only mentions the username“ which i think is the part behind the @, right? Because i don’t want to change that, only the Real Name“ in front :)
[2019-01-18 10:14:49] <cmpbiendl> Just found out, sry 
[2019-01-18 14:56:50] <Bluscream> any gitter devs?

[2019-01-18 16:32:58] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @BluscreamBetter to just ask your question right away instead of asking if someone is here. Don't ask to ask, just ask
[2019-01-18 16:34:24] <MadLittleMods>  January 18, 2019 4:12 AM @cmpbiendl Feel free to update the docs to make this more clearA Gitter account is associated with GitLab/GitHub/Twitter and matches whatever info you have on that platform.https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/accounts.md

[2019-01-18 22:10:36] <NetcrackerProjects> Hi. Is this correct room to report or discuss an issue related to my account?
[2019-01-18 22:42:36] <MadLittleMods> NetcrackerProjects: Related to your Gitter account, yes
[2019-01-19 19:37:49] <Bluscream> thanks
[2019-01-22 14:59:01] <codesections> Quick question: does Gitter have spell check in the desktop client? If so, how do I enable it?  (I'm using the desktop client on Linux, in case that is relevant).  Thanks :)
[2019-01-22 15:16:06] <MadLittleMods> codesections: Spellcheck is disabled, see [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-01-24 04:30:45] <srnb_gitlab> Is there a nice way to load custom CSS on the desktop linux client?
[2019-01-24 04:30:51] <srnb_gitlab> I want to theme my gitter to Nord
[2019-01-24 06:24:08] <MadLittleMods> srnb_gitlab: Not a nice way but you can do this, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-01-24 18:28:35] <miohtama> Could you make the sidebar wider - I get a lot of community names cut off and I still have 26" of screen space left
[2019-01-24 18:29:39] <miohtama>  [<-LINK->] 
[2019-01-24 18:29:51] <miohtama> Thank you and keep up the good work <3
[2019-01-24 21:10:28] <MadLittleMods> miohtama: How wide would your ideal be?
[2019-01-24 21:29:03] <TallTed> MadLittleMods: /cc@miohtamaBetter than any fixed width would be user-adjustable ...In either case, letting the channelnames wrap therein would improve matters immensely (and possibly obviate the need to increase the fixed width.)
[2019-01-24 21:57:26] <MadLittleMods> @TallTed If we can stay away from user-adjustable everything, it makes things a lot simpler, https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/#convention-over-configuration [<-CODE->] 
[2019-01-24 22:09:03] <TallTed> @MadLittleModssighsDevelopers know best, so users should just suck it up!Or rather, developers don't want to do complex things so users must suffer!Also, let's apply a philosophy that makes sense in some arenas to all arenas because if it's good one place it must be good everywhere!Fooey.I suggested something that would avoid adjustable widths (i.e., wrapping channelnames), because I knew there would be dev pushback on adjustability.  There is no one-size-fits-all width, because channelnames can be quite long, and (someday) font sizes will be (more) variable, and wide enough for "iiiiiii/iiiiiii" is far too narrow for "mmmmmmm/mmmmmmm" unless using a monospaced font which nobody likes outside of codeblocks....HTML frames typically allow the user to drag them wider/narrower, within some range of reasonability.  This browser-leveraging not-really-an-app app should allow the same, even if they revert on app restart and/or page reload.
[2019-01-24 22:13:02] <TallTed> @MadLittleModsAlso note, from that same link --Sometimes configuration is inevitable or preferable.
[2019-01-24 22:21:42] <MadLittleMods> @TallTed It's not out of the question, but would prefer to explore simpler changes that can address the majority caseCurrently, we show the community avatar and just the room name if it is really long. If both the community and room name fit under a certain limit, we show both with hover expansion, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/b6e49d5b74823f3fbb1980ee071cf220124a6f95/shared/parse/left-menu-primary-item.js#L55-75Wrapping is a decent suggestion but I haven't prototyped it to see how it actually feels. I am curious if you want to make a merge request
[2019-01-24 22:28:00] <TallTed> @MadLittleModsNot all users are devs.  Even in FOSS world.  I am mostly user, somewhat debugger, mostly not coder.In this case, I think making the channelnames wrappable should be a small CSS switch flip, shouldn't require digging into JS or other code much if at all.
[2019-01-24 22:32:26] <miohtama> MadLittleMods: I have 7-8 letters cut off from the repositories. I would say adding 33% to the width might do it and still not making the sidebar look fat
[2019-01-24 22:38:17] <MadLittleMods> @TallTed Just so you are aware, it's not something I am going to be looking into myself but willing to look at your changes@miohtama Seems like a lot but was curious earlier before you replied and I thought about making the minibar smaller (I also made the left menu overall a bit wider), https://i.imgur.com/05l0THK.png
[2019-01-25 00:11:57] <srnb_gitlab> MadLittleMods: Will I be turned down if I pr a better system for custom css? (Not anything super visible or exploitable, just something like~/.gitter/css/main.css?)
[2019-01-25 00:13:00] <MadLittleMods> srnb_gitlab: Seems reasonable. Do you know how other apps handle this sort of thing?
[2019-01-25 00:13:48] <srnb_gitlab> Slack allows for setting colors in the sidebar but that's about it for what I know
[2019-01-25 00:14:26] <srnb_gitlab> When I used a utility to turn websites into electron apps I was able to patch in JS just like the issue linked to load CSS but it's still not fun
[2019-01-25 00:15:00] <srnb_gitlab> Using a file is how I personally would want it done for all desktop apps /shrug
[2019-01-25 00:16:42] <srnb_gitlab> When I use plugin systems for things that style that's how the styling is done; via a file
[2019-01-25 05:26:45] <MadLittleMods> srnb_gitlab: via a file seems good to me. If you have some questions, feel free to push your WIP merge request and add a discussion point or come chat in [<-LINK->] 
[2019-01-25 21:43:25] <dwelle> Is there a way (or open feature request) to not display window title's notification counter  (in browser tab) for rooms which are muted?
[2019-01-25 21:46:30] <dwelle> mhm, maybe it's actually the default --- need to double check
[2019-01-25 22:23:45] <MadLittleMods> @dwelle I am pretty sure it works like that already, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/notifications.md#mute [<-CODE->] 
[2019-01-25 22:25:32] <TallTed>  [<-LINK->] Typical "users don't matter, only devs matter, piss off if you don't like it" kind of response.  Sad.
[2019-01-25 22:29:24] <MadLittleMods> TallTed: It seemed like you thought I was going to look into it so I was just giving you a heads up. My time is spent elsewhere on security issues, technical debt, and trying to touch things on the roadmap. If you would like to see a change, merge request welcome
[2019-01-25 22:32:42] <dwelle> MadLittleMods: yea I think I must have gotten a false positive from a room I thought was muted, but wasn't.. everyone is silent right now, so I'll get back to you tomorrow if the issue persists
[2019-01-25 22:48:39] <TallTed> @MadLittleMods  - Here's a better response: "I see your point. That might be a useful improvement to UI/UX. I don't have time to look into it right now, but I've created an issue for it (gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#2075), so others are aware it's a user wish."Tagging the issue as "good first issue", "help wanted", "UI/UX/CSS" or the like would probably also be helpful, but I don't know how to do that in gitlab.
[2019-01-25 22:56:25] <TallTed> miohtama: - You may want to track gitlab-org/ [<-ISSUE->] (by which I mean [<-ISSUE->] ... because gitter doesn't know how to mention gitlab issues)
[2019-01-25 22:57:10] <MadLittleMods> TallTed: Thanks for the issue, I added some labels (you don't have permission to add them yourself)
[2019-01-25 22:58:01] <MadLittleMods> I've left offAccepting merge requestsas there isn't a set solution decided yet
[2019-01-25 23:07:03] <TallTed> Small steps forward are better than no steps forward.
[2019-01-28 18:33:15] <rahul-iyer> Hi Guys, is there a way to know the most active gitter communities.
[2019-01-28 18:36:47] <MadLittleMods> @rahul-iyer No, you can track gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#469 for community and room stats@pdurbin was also interested in this earlier  November 9, 2018 4:26 PM
[2019-01-28 18:40:52] <pdurbin> MadLittleMods: yes! Is there anything I can do to help move that feature along?
[2019-01-28 18:48:27] <MadLittleMods> @pdurbin If your interested in creating a script that does a one time calculation, we can work from there, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/tree/develop/scripts/utils [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
[2019-01-28 19:09:57] <pdurbin> I'm confused. It sounds like I need access to help. So I'm blocked, right?
[2019-01-28 19:11:04] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] If you want to explore the chat messages in the Mongo database locally, [<-CODE->] 
[2019-01-28 19:12:59] <pdurbin> So you're saying. Get it working against localhost and maybe you can clean it up and put it into production.
[2019-01-28 19:57:10] <pdurbin> I'll think about it. Glad you're happy to talk about it, at least. :)
[2019-01-29 03:57:47] <j143-bot> Hi, I was planning to host gitter but three versions of elastic search + and the 3 backend microservices are way too big for me. 1. Is there some help here, to host it standalone only on one machine. 2. I tried to host it on google cloud, but the cost of each service individually is so high (such as redis vms).
[2019-01-29 03:57:58] <j143-bot> Any small info helps. Thanks.
[2019-01-29 04:04:40] <MadLittleMods> @j143-bot I suggest just running the Docker-ized development version, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#backgroundOnly problem is that search doesn't work, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1919
[2019-01-31 12:16:22] <Phauglin> Hello everyone, I got myself into a little bit of a pickle. I do have a GitLab account which is connected directly to the university I study at. That means that I can't log in with my credentials to gitter. Does anyone have an idea how to do that?
[2019-01-31 14:34:21] <aev-mambro2> I'm using Gitter for Android, and after a few minutes it fails to show new reponses in the channels / rooms / whatever. I have to restart the app to see them. The new-messages counter increases so it does recognize new messages; it just doesn't show them. Any hints on how to solve that?
[2019-01-31 15:30:47] <MadLittleMods>  January 31, 2019 6:16 AM @Phauglin If you can sign in with that GitLab account, you should be able sign into Gitter with itIf you can no longer access your GitLab account, then it would probably be best to contact GitLab support to try to recover it. See "I need help accessing my free GitLab.com account.", https://about.gitlab.com/support/

[2019-01-31 17:37:01] <MadLittleMods> aev-mambro2: Doesn't help with your actual issue but I just created a fix for the issue decorations on mobile going to a 404, [<-CODE->] 
[2019-01-31 17:37:59] <aev-mambro2> MadLittleMods: Excellent!
[2019-01-31 17:38:35] <aev-mambro2> MadLittleMods: BTW: as long as I stay inside a room, new messages do appear. Once I start
[2019-01-31 17:38:47] <aev-mambro2> switching, messages
[2019-01-31 17:38:51] <MadLittleMods> aev-mambro2: Mind adding those details to the issue?

[2019-01-31 20:23:27] <genotrance> hello - I have an existing community room that I'd like to move into another community - is that possible?

[2019-02-01 15:01:36] <TheOneRing_gitlab> Hi I'm currently evaluating gitter and gitlab for work, am I right that private romms/communities only work with github and not with gitlab?
[2019-02-01 16:09:11] <MadLittleMods> @TheOneRing_gitlab  Gitter communities and rooms can only be associated with GitHub orgs/repos at the moment. You can track this issue for GitLab based rooms gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1445But you can still create a private room not associated with anything and add the GitLab integration so you see repo activity in the sidebar
[2019-02-01 22:39:16] <ioquatix> Hello, how do I make a badge link for embedding into Markdown README on Github? I seem to recall this used to be really easy, but under "Share this chat room" I can't find any kind of link/badge/markdown.
[2019-02-01 22:41:55] <MadLittleMods> @ioquatix It's only visible for GitHub rooms. Here is the snippet [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/b68b70d88475185a66e859d07b83604b971756af/public/js/views/modals/tmpl/share-view.hbs#L13-29
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/b68b70d88475185a66e859d07b83604b971756af/public/js/views/modals/share-view.js
[2019-02-01 22:42:27] <ioquatix> Oh, yeah, I was expected the "Send pull request" button to show up.
[2019-02-01 22:42:58] <ioquatix> When I created the room, I did connect it to github. But then it made a room called "community" and I'm not sure how to create a room for github any more.
[2019-02-01 22:43:20] <ioquatix> It used to be really obvious - it's a bit confusing that the "Send pull request" and markdown link generation are hidden.
[2019-02-01 22:43:22] <MadLittleMods> ioquatix: If you link your community/room, I can better explain what is going on
[2019-02-01 22:43:37] <ioquatix>  [<-LINK->] 
[2019-02-01 22:43:38] <ioquatix> This one
[2019-02-01 22:44:55] <ioquatix> How do I connect it to kurocha/teapot on github?
[2019-02-01 22:46:00] <MadLittleMods> @ioquatix I should clarify that the badge snippet is only visible for a room connected to a GitHub repohttps://gitter.im/kurocha is associated with https://github.com/kurocha
https://gitter.im/kurocha/community inherits permissions from the community [<-CODE->] 
[2019-02-01 22:46:20] <ioquatix> Okay, I'll do that
[2019-02-01 22:46:35] <ioquatix> It's probably not silly to show the Gitter markdown even if the room is not connected to a repo
[2019-02-01 22:46:41] <MadLittleMods> ioquatix: If you don't see your repo in the typeahead or auto-associate, see [<-LINK->] 
[2019-02-01 22:46:56] <MadLittleMods> ioquatix: I agree, send a MR :)
[2019-02-01 22:47:07] <ioquatix> What is a MR?
[2019-02-01 22:47:35] <MadLittleMods> ioquatix: MR = Merge request on GitLab (like a Pull Request on GitHub)
[2019-02-01 22:50:22] <ioquatix> I'm sorry but right now I don't have time to do that, if I had time I would love to help. I think you should do this though +1
[2019-02-01 22:50:57] <ioquatix> Thanks for all your help though, it was really useful <3
[2019-02-01 22:51:13] <MadLittleMods> ioquatix: Create an issue so we can track this and I can add theAccepting merge requestlabel on it so others know they can pick it up, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-02-01 22:51:21] <ioquatix> Sure

[2019-02-01 23:03:50] <TheOneRing_gitlab> MadLittleMods: I get 404 on that issue?
[2019-02-01 23:04:27] <TheOneRing_gitlab> And the doc doesn't mention private communities unrelated to GitHub
[2019-02-01 23:05:11] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
[2019-02-01 23:06:30] <MadLittleMods> @TheOneRing_gitlab The different types of rooms are sorta discussed here, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/rooms.md#room-securityBut I am open to a merge request to update the docs to clarify things where you were expecting that information to be
[2019-02-02 15:16:19] <gpotter2> Hi ! Thanks for gitter ! Is transparency supported in the logos (e.g. channels logos/user avatars..?) I can't manage to get it working...
[2019-02-02 17:59:06] <MadLittleMods> gpotter2: We pull the avatars from GitHub/Twitter but on Gitter there are styles to add a white background behind any avatar
[2019-02-02 18:00:58] <pdurbin> MadLittleMods: did you end up hiring anyone?
[2019-02-02 18:02:28] <MadLittleMods> pdurbin: Still in the process. There are a few bubbling up through the various interviews now
[2019-02-02 18:02:57] <pdurbin> sounds like good progress
[2019-02-04 08:27:08] <firanolfind_gitlab> pdurbin: I think they are still hiring, just received suggestion
[2019-02-04 12:13:48] <ryan-ju> Hi, don't think if this is the right place to ask.  When I join a chat, how can I tell who the admins are?
[2019-02-04 12:14:36] <ryan-ju> Is there a special icon/label for admins?
[2019-02-04 16:11:06] <MadLittleMods> @ryan-ju In the people roster, you may see someone with a bar under their name but the roster isn't sorted to have all of them there. You can track gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1847 for better distinguishingBut feel free to create an issue about listing the admins at the top, at least in the "See all" view, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues
[2019-02-04 20:05:20] <aev-mambro2> I'm having a UX problem with the Android app. When entering the chat message input field, the app opens the on-screen keyboard in a mode that suggests there are additional fields to fill out. On my particular keyboard (Hackers' Keyboard), this makes a tab key appear to the right of the space bar. Pressing this tab key by accident (which happens to me all the time) causes the app to send the message to the server. Since there is no other field within reach, the keyboard should open in a mode that reflects that, and omit the tab key. I don't experience this problem in most other clients for other chat and social media.
[2019-02-04 20:54:36] <MadLittleMods> @aev-mambro2 Feel free to create an issue, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-android-app/issues [<-CODE->]

[2019-02-05 09:45:49] <tgunr_twitter> What would be an appropriate room to ask about rsyslog in general? Debian specifically?
[2019-02-05 19:44:33] <MadLittleMods> @tgunr_twitter I don't see a general Debian room, https://gitter.im/home/explore/tags/debian or an English speaking DevOps room, https://gitter.im/home/explore/tags/curated:devops,devopsBut you can try asking in the general developer room, https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/developers

[2019-02-06 10:51:04] <grzkv> Hey. I want to do github integration in gitter. How do I add it webhooks? What parameters do I use?The documentation seems to be out of date and deals with deprecated service hooks.Thanks in advance!
[2019-02-06 10:53:36] <grzkv> Namely, what should be thePayload URL,Content type, andSecret.
[2019-02-06 12:20:52] <davitperaze_gitlab> Allow Georgia to allowed country list
[2019-02-06 17:11:27] <MadLittleMods> davitperaze_gitlab: Thanks for the heads-up, I have updated the app to not restrict any countries, [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-02-06 17:16:45] <MadLittleMods>  February 6, 2019 4:51 AM @grzkv What docs are you looking at now? Feel free to submit a merge request to update them, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/integrations.mdHere is what the fields should look like on GitHub for manual webhook setup: [<-CODE->] 
[2019-02-06 22:28:57] <grzkv> MadLittleMods: Thanks. I guess ,e/xxxshould becommunity/room. Is that correct?
[2019-02-06 22:29:32] <grzkv> I tried that, and get404webhook delivery failure.
[2019-02-06 22:31:46] <MadLittleMods> @grzkv No, it's a random hash you can find the URL if you go to your integration list(not actual hashes/tokens)
[2019-02-06 22:32:01] <grzkv> Already figured out. Thanks
[2019-02-06 22:32:04] <grzkv> :)
[2019-02-06 22:38:14] <grzkv> MadLittleMods: FYI, I got outdated docs. By following "Configure your integrations" in the room sidebar -> GitHub -> Manual
[2019-02-06 23:14:19] <MadLittleMods> grzkv: Please link or explain where you are seeing those instructions
[2019-02-07 06:26:34] <davitperaze_gitlab> MadLittleMods: App became available just now. thanks
[2019-02-07 06:27:20] <MadLittleMods> davitperaze_gitlab: Thanks for the heads-up and updating the issue  [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-02-07 06:29:45] <davitperaze_gitlab> 
[2019-02-07 08:40:34] <grzkv> MadLittleMods: In Gitter web app: Click on integrations config→ select Github→ Get manual instructions
[2019-02-07 18:34:59] <MadLittleMods> @grzkv Thanks for the details. Mind creating an issue? https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issuesThe relevant code is here but it is a private project, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-webhooks-handler/blob/b725f5b36f8e709ac792ea5da894febcaacbe370/services/views/auth/pop-up-parent.pug#L52-63

[2019-02-09 17:48:25] <LexiconCode> Second I don't like being locked into a particular service if possible. If I choose later with users and chat history to migrate to a different service?
[2019-02-09 18:17:01] <rebolek> LexiconCode: go to [<-LINK->] for token.
[2019-02-09 19:16:05] <LexiconCode> rebolek: Thank you!
[2019-02-09 19:21:58] <MadLittleMods>  February 9, 2019 11:47 AM @LexiconCode You can track this issue for a proper export feature, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1899But you can use the API now to export data

[2019-02-11 04:25:01] <MadLittleMods> @j4472 I'm not sure really what you are talking about. Can you give some more details and explain it a different way?Keep in mind, this room is for Gitter(the chat app itself) support, not general technical help
[2019-02-11 15:03:15] <ruchit2801> Is there any feature to reset passwords of my co-workers in gitter? I mean, Can I as admin force everyone in my channel to reset their passwords? If there is any such feature, will I be logged out or it will exclude me? I apologise if this is not a right place to ask...
[2019-02-11 17:02:33] <MadLittleMods> ruchit2801: There are no Gitter specific passwords. You would have to do it through GitHub/GitLab and I don't know think they have that feature (at least on GitLab.com)
[2019-02-11 20:40:20] <velara3> I've read the docs and this line is confusing:
[2019-02-11 20:40:26] <velara3> "Use the "+" button in the bottom-left of the menu bar to start the community creation process.Communities can be associated with a GitHub organisation or repo. "
[2019-02-11 20:41:16] <velara3> So I have to create a public repo on github to create a community?  ( [<-LINK->] )
[2019-02-11 20:42:31] <MadLittleMods> velara3: A Gitter community doesn't have to be associated with anything. Are you interested in submitting a merge request to clarify that in the docs?
[2019-02-11 20:43:22] <velara3> That would be great. When I tried to add a community it gave me an error message. Let me grab that quick
[2019-02-11 20:46:07] <velara3>  [<-LINK->] 
[2019-02-11 20:46:10] <velara3> Ok I clicked the Create Community button and then entered "Web Design" in the name and below that [<-LINK->] was auto filled in. I clicked the Next button (it looks disabled) and it popped up a message (shown above)
[2019-02-11 20:50:14] <MadLittleMods> @velara3 The error message isn't the best, here is the issue to track that gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1951We try to reserve URIs from GitHub as best as possible and https://github.com/Web-Design already exists. In order to create the https://gitter.im/Web-Design community, it would need to be associated with https://github.com/Web-DesignIt's trying to suggest that if you own https://github.com/Web-Design, you should allow the Gitter private repo access OAuth scope on the GitHub organization so we can actually see that you own the GitHub org, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/faq.md#why-isnt-my-github-organisation-or-repos-appearing
[2019-02-11 20:51:28] <velara3> OK you said it's possible to create a community without a github repo? So I can leave that URL blank? Oh I see. I have pick an unused URL
[2019-02-11 20:52:31] <MadLittleMods> @velara3 You can create a Gitter community without any association. But the community URI can't conflict with something that already exists on GitHubThe URI is unused on Gitter but not GitHub
[2019-02-11 20:55:19] <velara3> MadLittleMods: Can you verify, there is no design or web design groups yet? I did a quick search and the list was empty. I'd be glad to get some started :)
[2019-02-11 20:57:36] <MadLittleMods> @velara3 There is https://gitter.im/duxxy/home (originally created by some Gitter staff) but it's not very activeYou can also check out these,https://gitter.im/home/explore/tags/design

[2019-02-12 04:53:51] <kdheepak> If there's an organization on GitHub, how can I create a community for it on Gitter?
[2019-02-12 04:54:08] <kdheepak> I'm unable to see it in any of the options I've tried.
[2019-02-12 04:54:21] <kdheepak> I'm one of the owners of the organization.
[2019-02-12 04:54:25] <MadLittleMods> kdheepak: See [<-LINK->] 
[2019-02-12 04:55:50] <kdheepak> Thanks for the link! I can't see it, even though I can see my other orgs.
[2019-02-12 04:55:57] <kdheepak> So it's not my personal oauth that's causing the issue.
[2019-02-12 04:56:31] <kdheepak> How often does the gitter interface refresh the organization list?
[2019-02-12 04:57:09] <kdheepak> We created the github organization earlier this morning. Should I see it appear in gitter immediately?
[2019-02-12 04:57:29] <MadLittleMods> kdheepak: The GitHub API call happens when the list is rendered. Please check your organization settings which is also explained in that FAQ
[2019-02-12 04:57:39] <kdheepak> It's a public repository.
[2019-02-12 04:58:23] <MadLittleMods> kdheepak: The repo may be public but we still need to see if you are in the organization
[2019-02-12 04:59:10] <kdheepak> I am, and I am the owner as well. I just checked.
[2019-02-12 05:00:21] <MadLittleMods> @kdheepak What I mean is, from the GitHub API call perspective, we don't see you that you are in the organization.Visit https://github.com/organizations/YOURORG/settings/applications and make sure that you have granted Gitter public and private repo scope. You can read more about the scopes here, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/oauth-scopes.mdYou can also try making your organisation membership public, https://github.com/orgs/YOURORG/people
[2019-02-12 05:01:58] <kdheepak> Thanks for the information again. I made my organization membership public. But still don't see it. Should I create a new application for Gitter?
[2019-02-12 05:02:21] <kdheepak> i.e. should I register an application?
[2019-02-12 05:02:45] <kdheepak> sorry for the dumb questions. I've done this before for another organization and I know I didn't have to do any of this.
[2019-02-12 05:03:47] <MadLittleMods> kdheepak: I feel like you haven't granted Gitter public and private repo scope on the organization. If you want to get prompted again you can visit [<-LINK->] 
[2019-02-12 05:04:23] <kdheepak> Hmm. I've tried that link just now.
[2019-02-12 05:04:40] <kdheepak> Still no luck.
[2019-02-12 05:04:49] <MadLittleMods> kdheepak: Can you take a screenshot of your organizations OAuth application page? [<-LINK->] 
[2019-02-12 05:05:14] <kdheepak> It's blank, and says register new application.
[2019-02-12 05:06:20] <kdheepak>  [<-LINK->] 
[2019-02-12 05:07:40] <kdheepak> My other orgs where I've created gitter pages for don't have any application installed here as well.
[2019-02-12 05:08:18] <MadLittleMods> @kdheepak You just want to grant Gitter public and private repo scope on the organizationUse https://gitter.im/login/upgrade?scopes=repo and grant access,
[2019-02-12 05:09:07] <kdheepak>  [<-LINK->] 
[2019-02-12 05:09:28] <kdheepak> I get this page and then when I click upgrade it just redirects here.
[2019-02-12 05:10:19] <kdheepak> ( for what it is worth, I'm able to create more gitter rooms on the other orgs where I haven't installed the gitterHQ application. )
[2019-02-12 05:11:09] <MadLittleMods> @kdheepak Okay, that means you already have private repo access granted personally.You can also do this to allow access on the orgVisit your personal application settings and find any Gitter applications there, click on the name of application and you should see the list of organisations that allow access to the application and you can grant access here.https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/oauth-scopes.mdAlternatively, you can disable organisation access control which is what you may have done for your other orgs, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/oauth-scopes.md#organisation-access-control
[2019-02-12 05:14:07] <kdheepak> Visit your personal application settings and find any Gitter applications there, click on the name of application and you should see the list of organisations that allow access to the application and you can grant access here.Okay, I hadn't done this. But I did that just now as well.
[2019-02-12 05:14:14] <kdheepak> And still nothing.
[2019-02-12 05:14:36] <kdheepak> I went through both private and public gitterhq apps, and granted permissions todss-extensions.
[2019-02-12 05:15:40] <MadLittleMods> @kdheepak Just to confirm, when you visit https://github.com/organizations/dss-extensions/settings/applications, do you see the Gitter public/private repo applications now?The next step would be to just refresh the page and check the community creation list again
[2019-02-12 05:16:16] <kdheepak> I do not.
[2019-02-12 05:16:23] <kdheepak> I tried refreshing.

[2019-02-12 05:16:45] <kdheepak>  [<-LINK->] 
[2019-02-12 05:17:58] <kdheepak> Weird, right?
[2019-02-12 05:18:37] <kdheepak> @kdheepak Just to confirm, when you visit https://github.com/organizations/dss-extensions/settings/applications, do you see the Gitter public/private repo applications now?I do not.
[2019-02-12 05:20:02] <MadLittleMods> @kdheepak Sounds like we still need to sort out the OAuth applications on GitHub first. You should see them listed https://github.com/organizations/dss-extensions/settings/applications if you just granted them. If you go back to your personal OAuth apps and check on that org specifically, are they still granted?It looks like the https://gitter.im/dss-extensions community doesn't exist yet. You are looking at the room creation modal at the moment instead of the community creation process, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/communities.md#community-creation
[2019-02-12 05:22:39] <kdheepak> Thank you!!!
[2019-02-12 05:23:03] <kdheepak> I tried that first! But I couldn't create the community because I hadn't granted the permissions.
[2019-02-12 05:23:11] <kdheepak> And didn't think to try that again.
[2019-02-12 05:25:29] <MadLittleMods> @kdheepak No problem, sorry the steps weren't obvious from the get-go. If you have any suggestions on how to make the docs more clear, please feel free to submit a merge requestWe link to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/faq.md#why-isnt-my-github-organisation-or-repos-appearing on the community creation pageBut this error message could be improved, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1951
[2019-02-12 05:27:03] <kdheepak> I think the biggest thing for me was that when I tried to create a community, while I typeddss-extensionsand it was a tick mark at the end all the way till I typed the full name, after which it was anx.
[2019-02-12 05:27:27] <kdheepak> I hovered over thexto see if an error would show up but it did not.
[2019-02-12 05:28:17] <kdheepak> I googled and found some document that said I could only create communities that are not associated to Github if the name wasn't already taken on Github, and figured that was the reason behind thex.
[2019-02-12 05:29:59] <kdheepak> I can submit a PR with more screenshots.
[2019-02-12 05:30:33] <MadLittleMods> @kdheepak  Ye, the native HTML5 form error only appears on submissionCode is here if are interested in adding some sort of tooltip or just showing the error out in the openhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/383c04b935c858d5f8d9ade9710ef59985a7217b/public/js/views/community-create/main-step/community-creation-main-view.hbs#L16-21

[2019-02-12 05:31:04] <kdheepak> Haha amazing.
[2019-02-12 05:31:07] <kdheepak> I'll look into it.

[2019-02-14 02:42:32] <cgay> hi all, my group is looking at moving fro slack to gitter but it sort of looks like the integration with github has broken down with the disabling of github web hooks. Have I missed something and if so could you point me at the docs?  e.g., is there a github app?  Thanks.
[2019-02-14 02:45:32] <cgay> woa, neat thats/then/there/just works!  :)
[2019-02-14 02:50:38] <MadLittleMods> @cgay You can still set it up manually but the instructions need a little updating atm, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#2084Some previous discussion,  February 6, 2019 11:16 AM

[2019-02-14 14:05:51] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @Vairocana_gitlabIs it crashing for you? We do show a notification for unhandled various errors that can be mostly ignored which may add to this feeling. You can turn these off in the "Gitter" menu at the top
[2019-02-14 14:10:05] <MadLittleMods>  February 14, 2019 7:38 AM @siddhantsme_twitter Can you send an email to support@gitter.im so we can confirm that you control those accounts before I clean them up?Please use the primary email associated with those old accounts to verify you did control them. You can also cc them into the ticket after you create it
[2019-02-14 14:12:38] <siddhantsme_twitter> The rooms created would also be cleaned?

[2019-02-14 16:44:57] <eddideku> I've signed into Gitter with Github, however I'm having a hard time trying to find a way to change my display name on here. Is the only way to do this is by changing it on Github, then deleting your Gitter account, then signing back in?
[2019-02-14 16:46:41] <MadLittleMods> eddideku: Just need to update it on GitHub, then sign out and back in to Gitter ( [<-LINK->] )
[2019-02-14 16:47:18] <eddideku> Ah, thanks I should have tried that first.
[2019-02-16 12:54:12] <davidchambers> I haven't been seeing GitHub activity in activity feeds since 31 January. Is this a known issue?
[2019-02-16 13:11:20] <davidchambers> Sharkbyteprojects: , do you see the same thing in the sanctuary-js/sanctuary room, for example?
[2019-02-16 13:15:11] <davidchambers> I'm trying to determine whether the functionality is broken for everyone or just for me.
[2019-02-16 13:19:06] <davidchambers> I'm seeing activity in fantasyland/fantasy-land, so perhaps I should recreate the API tokens.
[2019-02-16 18:25:11] <MadLittleMods> @davidchambers There have been a couple other people who have reported that their GitHub integration activity stopped working, January 8, 2019 3:04 PM
 January 10, 2019 7:30 PMIt's probably related to the following but plenty of other rooms are still working fine,January 31, 2019: GitHub will stop delivering installed services' events on GitHub.com.https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/replacing-github-services/#deprecation-timeline
[2019-02-16 18:27:05] <davidchambers> Thanks,@MadLittleMods. Is there a guide to using webhooks to have GitHub activity appear in Gitter?
[2019-02-16 18:31:42] <MadLittleMods> davidchambers: Ye, here are the current docs to set it up again, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-02-16 18:32:34] <davidchambers> Thanks!
[2019-02-17 18:54:20] <fullofcaffeine> How do I go about searching for very old messages in a gitter room? I know a keyword that was mentioned, but gitter doesn't find the message. It's older than a year I think.
[2019-02-17 20:23:31] <MadLittleMods> @fullofcaffeine All messages are indexed so if it has enough relevance, it should show upA bit separate but you can track this issue for date sorting in search, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#566
[2019-02-17 20:24:25] <MadLittleMods> If you can find the message eventually, feel free to share a permalink along with exactly what you were trying to search
[2019-02-18 18:01:02] <syl20bnr> Hi there, I have a bug with my github webhook for #spacemacs channel.There is no update since 31st January although the webhooks are correctly send to Gitter
[2019-02-18 18:02:52] <syl20bnr> my bad, I believe the webhook has been removed actually
[2019-02-18 18:03:11] <MadLittleMods> Hey @syl20bnr, there have been other reports of this, see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/2084#github-integration-activity-has-stopped-working-for-some-peopleYou can manually set it up again with the workaround steps in that issue
[2019-02-18 18:03:12] <syl20bnr> checking, if I'm not reposting then it is fixed :-)
[2019-02-18 18:03:20] <syl20bnr> 
[2019-02-18 19:12:26] <WickedBrat> Hey!
[2019-02-18 19:12:49] <WickedBrat> How can I add more rooms ?
[2019-02-18 19:24:10] <WickedBrat> ?
[2019-02-18 19:24:29] <tgunr> I think you can only add room to communities you create
[2019-02-18 19:25:18] <tgunr> I would like to add some communities, e.g. openzfs but can not, why?
[2019-02-18 19:26:10] <WickedBrat> Yes, I have created the community, now I wish to add more rooms to it. I'm unable to locate any options to do so.
[2019-02-18 19:27:50] <tgunr> I don’t see a way either
[2019-02-18 19:27:56] <tgunr> ah , there it is
[2019-02-18 19:28:34] <tgunr>  [<-LINK->] 
[2019-02-18 19:31:01] <tgunr> Looks like I said, you have to have admin access to community to add rooms
[2019-02-18 19:33:04] <MadLittleMods> @WickedBrat @tgunr Here are the docs around adding rooms, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/rooms.md#room-creationIf you don't see your community listed after you have created it, it means we don't see you as a community admin. If it is a GitHub associated community, you probably need to add public and private scope to your org, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/oauth-scopes.md
[2019-02-18 19:35:15] <tgunr> ok, thanks, how do you delete a room, i don’t see a way
[2019-02-18 19:36:20] <MadLittleMods> tgunr: See [<-LINK->] . If you don't see the delete option, we don't see you as a room admin (you may need to [<-LINK->] )
[2019-02-18 19:37:31] <tgunr> Thanks, see it now
[2019-02-19 23:26:46] <pinkyblinky> Hello all. I'm trying to use the gitter API, and I was wondering if there was a way to retrieve the gitter room associated with a specific github repository? I.e. a  call such that Fn(<github repo name>) -> gitter_room_name. Is there something like this? Please let me know.
[2019-02-20 01:43:13] <MadLittleMods> @pinkyblinky There isn't an API endpoint for this. Feel free to create an issue, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issuesHere is relevant code and fields to look at,https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/b131e93460ffd7e32b2fca22ccdb7a1e58c8a075/server/api/v1/rooms/index.js#L42

[2019-02-20 19:31:54] <pinkyblinky> Ah ok. Thank you for the info!
[2019-02-21 21:45:29] <MadLittleMods> FlyxCutlery_twitter: This room is for Gitter support. If you want to chat about random things, use [<-LINK->] 
[2019-02-21 21:46:43] <FlyxCutlery_twitter> MadLittleMods: Apologies. Was just saying hello and was wondering what working at gitter is like. Noticed you're hiring.
[2019-02-21 21:48:13] <MadLittleMods> @FlyxCutlery_twitter This explains a lot of the general broad stuff, https://about.gitlab.com/jobs/But happy to answer your more specific questions
[2019-02-21 21:49:57] <FlyxCutlery_twitter> MadLittleMods: Just one.. You like it?
[2019-02-21 21:51:44] <FlyxCutlery_twitter> Wait so the /gitter channel is strictly for support? What's the green checkboxed Support over on the left at the top for then? Just trying to understand the UI in this context.
[2019-02-21 21:53:59] <MadLittleMods> FlyxCutlery_twitter: Ye, I love not having to commute and the flexibility to work whenever. I can just randomly spend time with family during the day to take a walk. On the Gitter team of 1, I also have a lot of autonomy to drive things as fast as possible
[2019-02-21 21:54:45] <MadLittleMods> @FlyxCutlery_twitter I am not sure what green checkbox you are seeing. Can you send a screenshot?Sounds like you are maybe looking at someone else's support room
[2019-02-22 13:32:56] <dhanushkumarg> Hi ,My self Dhanush, I am to New to the Gitter, i want to know the Room for PYDICOM
[2019-02-22 16:50:17] <rostrander_gitlab> dhanushkumarg: Looks to be [<-LINK->] 
[2019-02-22 16:51:20] <rostrander_gitlab> (To find that, I googled 'gitter PYDICOM', as I find using google to be easier than navigating gitter's own search, and sometimes people run theirowngitter instances that might not be on this server so it's an easy way to kind of do a 'global' search)
[2019-02-23 04:10:23] <MadLittleMods> phillsweeden: Please stop. This room is for Gitter support only, not general technical support. There is [<-LINK->] but your question isn't very conducive to a discussion in any case. It would be better to be more specific about your use case, what you have tried, and what you expect/wish would happen
[2019-02-23 17:42:22] <Bronzie123> hi
[2019-02-23 17:42:24] <Bronzie123> i want room
[2019-02-23 17:42:27] <Bronzie123> to speak to java developer
[2019-02-23 17:42:31] <Bronzie123> please
[2019-02-23 17:47:36] <MadLittleMods> Bronzie123: It looks like you already found [<-LINK->] which is a general developer room. Don't  ask whether someone is here, just ask your question directly
[2019-02-24 11:57:20] <Leei_Jaw_twitter> Hello, I am new to gitter.  I accidentally initiate a one-to-one conversion with a stranger. It is an empty conversation. It bugs me for a while. For chat room, I can simply leave the room.  But for person, there is only ahidebutton.  I tried to use/leave, but to no avail, worse, it just sent this/leavetext to that stranger.
[2019-02-24 11:58:28] <Leei_Jaw_twitter> After I hide the conversation, it reappears itself after a while. And that stranger is always shown on my people tab on mobile client of gitter.
[2019-02-24 19:56:44] <MadLittleMods> @Leei_Jaw_twitter You can only hide a one to one room. The room should only re-appear if you visit the room again or the other person sends you a message. [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
[2019-02-25 13:52:39] <cgay> Hi all. I've been doing the GitHub integration manually, which is one repo at a time. If I do it with the automatic method (and grant access) can i integrate the entire GitHub org in one shot?
[2019-02-25 13:53:22] <pdurbin> Out of curiosity, how many repos are you talking about?
[2019-02-25 13:53:47] <cgay> 65
[2019-02-25 13:54:04] <cgay> More I guess because we have several orgs.
[2019-02-25 16:10:55] <MarkoShiva> I mean gitter is at least developed with some sense when its about mem usage of app but slack slack is insane.
[2019-02-25 16:11:05] <MarkoShiva> And why is someone removing my messages here?
[2019-02-25 16:15:23] <MadLittleMods> @in1t3r I removed it because you called us crazy/lazy which adds nothing to your actual point. Happy to discuss the other thing.We don't use electron. The desktop app uses NW.js which is pretty similar though. NW.js allows us to build a desktop app by embedding the normal Gitter webapp so we don't need to maintain a separate codebase when a feature changes
[2019-02-25 16:18:38] <MarkoShiva> Oh ok sorry for that I was just annoyed on slack mostly as I have on this desktop only 8 gigs of ram and slack is happy to eat a quarter of that easy. Yeah I saw when checking the usage of open files and threads gitter uses far less then slack and its enough feature rich for my use case. I prefer IRC like apps so gitter is nice.
[2019-02-25 16:22:13] <MadLittleMods>  February 25, 2019 7:52 AM @cgay You can more easily select all of the repositories,For reference on the manual setup, the docs are a bit out of date but it seems you got that figured out, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#2084
[2019-02-25 16:55:25] <cgay> MadLittleMods: gotcha, thanks.
[2019-02-25 16:58:36] <cgay> Oh, it seems to want me to grant access to all my organizations though.  Not sure I can do that.
[2019-02-25 17:04:35] <MadLittleMods> cgay: If the other organizations are green/checked, they probably have 3rd party access control turned off or they already have that certain application granted. I am not sure GitHub has a way to uncheck. Not a great solution but you could revoke access afterwards on the other orgs
[2019-02-25 18:33:48] <MadLittleMods> Gitter 19.37.0 just deployed to production, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/pipelines/49148924Changelog: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#19370-2019-2-19This release includes a major upgrade from webpack v1 to v4 and the way we load JavaScript bundles/chunks. If you see anything strange, please create an issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues
[2019-02-25 18:45:11] <pdurbin> awesome to see such regular releases... good job
[2019-02-25 18:49:42] <MadLittleMods> pdurbin:  Thanks
[2019-02-25 20:30:30] <cgay> MadLittleMods: FYI that worked for me. Thanks.  It was a bit unnerving, as I had to basically say I was granting access to some orgs I don't control (e.g., "google") but I just went ahead and trusted that it would do the right thing.  :)  It offered me repos from some of the orgs but not others.
[2019-02-27 23:35:53] <cgay> Hey, sorry to bother you guys again but a friend can't seem to find our community or room. He's sent me some screenshots and it looks legit.  I can't find any bugs related to it.  Would someone mind searching for "dylan-lang" and see if the community shows up for you. I believe it should be public.
[2019-02-27 23:36:50] <cgay> He is able to go directly to the community URL but it says "0 rooms". [<-LINK->] 
[2019-02-27 23:39:34] <MadLittleMods> @cgay The community still exists, https://gitter.im/dylan-lang/homeIt does have a private root org room https://gitter.im/dylan-lang but you will have to be a member of https://github.com/orgs/dylan-lang/people to join it. If it is just giving a 404 for them, then we can't see their GitHub org membership and they should run through these steps https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/faq.md#why-isnt-my-github-organisation-or-repos-appearing
[2019-02-27 23:42:11] <cgay> I see, thanks. He's not a member of the GitHub org, just a contributor.  The box that says "only members of the github org can join" is unchecked.
[2019-02-27 23:43:04] <cgay> I mean the "Only GitHub users are allowed to join this room." box.
[2019-02-27 23:43:16] <cgay> I guess that's something else.
[2019-02-27 23:46:25] <MadLittleMods> @cgay The "Members of xxx can join this room" checkbox is only available when you create the room. But a root org room is a legacy type room that is always private and is for GitHub org members"Only GitHub users are allowed to join this room." in room settings is different from a room being public/private, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/rooms.md#restrict-room-to-github-users
[2019-02-27 23:51:45] <cgay> I see. I didn't realize the legacy room was restricted.  I created a new room that's public. Thanks again for the help.
[2019-02-28 18:09:43] <ferventcoder> Howdy folks, dumb question. If we need to see who we've banned, how do we do that? I see how to ban a user and unban a user, but I am not sure how I query to see who is banned.

[2019-02-28 18:58:40] <MadLittleMods> Heads-up, the Gitter Android app was removed from the Google Play Store for violating one of the Google Play Developer Program Policies (still waiting on some specific details)You can track this issue for details and notification when the app is restored, gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-android-app#117
[2019-02-28 20:12:04] <pdurbin> yikes! thanks for the heads up
[2019-03-01 02:58:40] <MadLittleMods> The Gitter Android app is back live on the Google Play Store , https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.gitter.gitterJust needed a small description change. Details in the issue
[2019-03-01 06:04:39] <mnafees> Is the iOS app being updated anytime soon?
[2019-03-01 06:04:55] <mnafees> Why has there been no attention to it since 2 years?
[2019-03-01 06:09:03] <leyayun> good job
[2019-03-01 06:09:21] <leyayun> haha
[2019-03-01 08:11:21] <MadLittleMods> @mnafees No feature development has happened on the iOS app but we did recently get deployments and builds working from GitLab CI (waiting on some macOS runners now), gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-ios-app!3Our priorities are elsewhere, you see the rough roadmap linked here, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#gitter-webappBut community merge requests are always welcome
[2019-03-01 23:43:56] <Randl> Is it possible to see a list of communities associated with my starred repos? I have a vague feeling I've seen it once
[2019-03-01 23:45:13] <MadLittleMods> Randl:  [<-LINK->] has some personalized suggestions which will look at what you starred, etc but there isn't something direct

[2019-03-05 13:12:40] <anubhavsinha98> Hi@all, actually I wanted to ask is there any expiry date of a particular token which is generated to add Github integration. Actually we have a group in which we have added the integration but there in no update since February.
[2019-03-05 13:13:51] <MadLittleMods> anubhavsinha98: See [<-LINK->] 
[2019-03-05 13:14:35] <anubhavsinha98> Thanks@MadLittleMods!
[2019-03-05 14:13:42] <pedro-w> Can anyone point me to a doc about language-specific formatting in  back tick  fences?gitter seems to partly support specifying a language (as github/gitlab do) but even with no language, it still adds colors in a way which is almost-but-not-quite javascript.
[2019-03-05 14:14:55] <MadLittleMods> pedro-w: If no language is specified, it will try to auto-detect. You can usetextif you don't want any syntax highlighting. You can manually specifyjsif you want JavaScript (or any other language)
[2019-03-05 14:15:51] <pedro-w> Thanks@MadLittleModsand is there a list of supported languages?
[2019-03-05 14:16:19] <MadLittleMods> pedro-w: Here is the list of supported languages for syntax highlighting (highlight.js) [<-LINK->] 
[2019-03-05 14:18:43] <pedro-w> Perfect, thanks. I've just come from the dylan-lang room which has recently switched to gitter
[2019-03-05 14:19:54] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] For my own reference, https://gitter.im/dylan-lang/general
[2019-03-05 14:23:21] <pedro-w> No dylan support in highlightjs, not surprising as it's pretty niche! But we might be able to do something about that... Thanks for your help.

[2019-03-08 09:11:11] <lukehinds> hi, we plan on hosting our comunity meetings for an open source project on gitter.im - are there any tools that folks have found useful? I am thinking of things like 'meetbot' that is used on IRC? Where you can dump the meeting notes with tags for actions,  notes etc?
[2019-03-08 11:37:23] <pdurbin> lukehinds: great idea! I've used Fedora's meetbot. It's nice. At least you'll already have the raw logs, just by using Gitter.
[2019-03-08 11:40:50] <lukehinds> pdurbin: I just noticed the archives pages, we could easily grab those are parse out commands such as [action] or [startmeeting] . Just thinking, is it possible to get those in raw format (archives) or are they shared over any sort of rest type API?
[2019-03-08 12:05:18] <pdurbin> I've played around with this "archive-gitter" thing and it works fine: [<-LINK->] 
[2019-03-08 12:13:58] <lukehinds> pdurbin: looks good thanks!
[2019-03-08 12:19:47] <pdurbin> Sure. I'm pretty into the idea of "data liberation". I don't want to put a lot of content into any system that makes it hard to get out. So I'm happy that Gitter makes it easy to get your content out via APIs.
[2019-03-08 13:18:45] <ohsayan> Hello there, may I ask a question - which theme does Gitter use for code?
[2019-03-08 14:52:19] <abhishalya> This is weird, but I'm not able to log in via GitHub on my Desktop browser but I was able to log in on my mobile browser.
[2019-03-08 14:53:12] <abhishalya> It says Forbidden. I even revoked access to gitter on GitHub but still same issue.
[2019-03-08 15:06:09] <abhishalya> I confirmed that it only happens with Firefox desktop browser, chrome works fine. I checked and I am on latest Firefox release.
[2019-03-08 16:18:13] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @sntdevcoSee [<-LINK->] 
[2019-03-08 16:22:28] <MadLittleMods>  March 8, 2019 8:52 AM @abhishalya I just tested and was able to sign in with the latest Firefox on desktop.Can you create an issue with some details so we can track this, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issuesI think we have had one other report of this from a week ago but they haven't responded at all, https://gitter.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/10268 [<-CODE->] 
[2019-03-08 16:41:11] <abhishalya> I just tried again and it works now (on Firefox too). So, I guess its occasional. But I was able to login via chrome, so it states otherwise.Are you able to sign into GitHub just fine? I am wondering if you are blocked there, https://github.com/Yeah, I was able to sign in on Github just fine.

[2019-03-10 15:06:38] <mielune> In iOS app, can I from messages ? Unable to find this feature
[2019-03-10 15:07:07] <pdurbin> Sorry, can you what?
[2019-03-10 15:08:10] <mielune> I would like to search content in a room
[2019-03-10 15:08:16] <grg124> hey how can i accesss setting option in giiter destop app
[2019-03-10 15:08:21] <grg124> ??
[2019-03-10 15:09:44] <pdurbin> The Android app has a magnifying glass you can tap.
[2019-03-10 15:20:53] <pdurbin> You have to go to "room settings" to get to general settings on the desktop app. I think it's weird, myself.
[2019-03-10 15:21:28] <pdurbin> mielune: @grg124^^
[2019-03-11 14:53:46] <abhishalya> We needed to extract the list of the room members through Gitter API. Since the coala room has over 2000 members in it, is there a fair way of getting the list? Since I believe it would require about > 2000/100 = 20 API calls to get the complete list
[2019-03-11 14:56:36] <MadLittleMods> @abhishalya There isn't a shortcut, would just need to paginate through the API 100 members at a time (20 calls in your case), https://developer.gitter.im/docs/rooms-resource#users [<-CODE->] 
[2019-03-11 15:01:32] <abhishalya> MadLittleMods: Yep, thanks. 
[2019-03-11 20:27:46] <TallTed> @MadLittleMods - A bit of weirdness, and some UI tweak thoughts, for the Archive views...  My search-fu is failing me today, so I'm not creating issues until confirmation that they wouldn't be duplicates.Start at https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter/archives/2019/02/14 for clear example...  (Issues below may not be visible when "signed in" in browser; I use desktop app for interaction and browser just for catch-up reading.) [<-CODE->] 
[2019-03-11 21:01:26] <MadLittleMods> @TallTed You can track gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1015 for differences in messages shown on each day from timezone issuesI couldn't find existing issues for the other things mentioned:A jump to next active date sounds good to me The current date is always the latest on the right but makes sense to have an active day highlightWe previously discussed changing the whole heatmap format to a normal calendar view which I would also be in favor of,  August 16, 2018 3:02 PM
[2019-03-12 00:10:21] <pdurbin> How often are the lists of curated rooms under [<-LINK->] updated?
[2019-03-12 01:52:14] <MadLittleMods> @pdurbin They haven't been updated in a long time, if you know of a room that should be added, just link it here and I can tag itHere is the code: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/c7996070576d7697a0ca84b1219ccd78d6b22edd/server/handlers/explore.js#L40-66

[2019-03-12 19:17:43] <MadLittleMods> Thanks@TallTed, I was thinking you were referring to the archive overview page that shows the year heatmap
[2019-03-12 20:35:45] <pedro-w> If a message is deleted by a user, would it be possible for it to leave some sort of mark? (at the moment I think it just disappears without trace, which makes some conversations look weird when looking back over history)
[2019-03-12 21:32:10] <MadLittleMods> @pedro-w You can edit a message to be blank and it will show as deleted with a message indicating it was. But this is different from the "delete" option. This functionality was changed in, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/commit/5061c411d181b11015ee2a47020ccb42b27b3e2c#aeeb18168f313060663ba97654e26003a2b29996_862_866Having a hard delete is nice for admins to clean up spam and irrelevant questions. We could change the functionality to be a bit more nuanced though (issue, merge request welcome)If the message is deleted by the author:  empty-message deletion
If the message is deleted by an admin: hard delete
[2019-03-12 21:32:54] <MadLittleMods> 
[2019-03-12 21:33:00] <MadLittleMods> ^ Example of empty-message deletion

[2019-03-13 12:50:51] <mcarifio> I may be asking this question in the wrong place. Is there an easy way to enlarge/set the font for desktop gitter? I've installed gitter 4.1 on Ubuntu 18.10. I looked in the docs and issues beforehand and googled, couldn't find something to help myself. Thanks.

[2019-03-15 17:10:54] <kdheepak> Is there a way to rename a room into something else?
[2019-03-15 17:11:24] <MadLittleMods> kdheepak: See [<-LINK->] 
[2019-03-15 17:14:47] <kdheepak> Thanks!
[2019-03-15 17:16:24] <kdheepak> Would you recommend deleting the room and creating another one with the right name, or following the instructions in the link to get it renamed?
[2019-03-15 17:20:25] <MadLittleMods> kdheepak: If you have some activity, feel free to send a rename request to maintain the history. If you just created the room, it's probably easier just to delete and create it with the proper name
[2019-03-15 17:21:09] <kdheepak> There are a few people who joined the room already
[2019-03-15 17:21:23] <kdheepak> Those would be preserved in the move?
[2019-03-15 17:21:48] <kdheepak> The people who joined the room would have the room link update on their end if I moved it, is that correct?
[2019-03-15 17:22:02] <MadLittleMods> kdheepak: Correct
[2019-03-15 17:22:30] <MadLittleMods> But you could just invite them to the new room if it is just a few
[2019-03-15 17:22:30] <kdheepak> and the new repo, I'd like it to be integrated with a corresponding Github repo by the same name.
[2019-03-15 17:23:21] <kdheepak> I sent in a request to move it, I'll talk to the others and see if we can delete and recreate. If we cannot, we'll go with the move.
[2019-03-15 17:23:38] <kdheepak> Thanks for quick replies!
[2019-03-15 17:23:54] <MadLittleMods> @kdheepak Was the repo renamed or is it a completely new project?for my reference: https://gitter.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/10355

[2019-03-27 15:15:52] <nagpalkaran-jpr_gitlab> Hello, I am here to build a community for a topic other than softwares, github repo. Basically it will not be related to Software of IT.Am I allowed to  do that?I am going to use Java SDK to integrate in my Android mobile app, is there any limitation to number of user my app can register, or number of groups my app can create or number of group members my app can add to a group?
[2019-03-27 16:41:08] <MadLittleMods> nagpalkaran-jpr_gitlab: You can use a Gitter room for whatever topic. There  aren't limits
[2019-03-27 21:45:39] <d7415> Hi. When connecting via IRC I am able to send but not receive private messages. Is this deliberate? Is there a way around it?
[2019-03-27 21:46:02] <d7415> Fortunately the emails about unread messages give me a prompt before too long has passed
[2019-03-27 21:48:58] <d7415> Ah, I see it's an ongoing issue...
[2019-03-27 21:50:17] <MadLittleMods> d7415: You can trackgitlab-org/gitter/irc-bridge#100
gitlab-org/gitter/irc-bridge#83
[2019-03-27 21:50:30] <d7415> Thanks. Just found them :)
[2019-03-27 21:50:33] <d7415> Will do
[2019-03-27 21:50:53] <d7415> Thanks for having the IRC bridge at least - finding that feature made me really happy :)
[2019-03-27 22:36:19] <MadLittleMods> d7415: :) if you want to try to better debug the problem, you can run the IRC bridge locally which will still point at production Gitter, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-03-28 07:10:22] <d7415> Ooh, interesting. I don't know when I'll have time, but thanks :)
[2019-03-28 12:50:40] <ghost~5c7a27c5d73408ce4fb96504> How can I change my username?
[2019-03-28 13:14:23] <kgashok> How to search for messages across all gitter rooms that I part of?
[2019-03-28 16:21:32] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @ghost~5c7a27c5d73408ce4fb96504 See [<-LINK->] 
[2019-03-28 16:22:14] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @kgashokIt's not possible at the moment. You can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-03-28 20:36:17] <lukeeey> Do people still use gitter
[2019-03-28 20:36:38] <nafg> sure, why not?
[2019-03-28 20:36:52] <lukeeey> Idk a lot of people use discord now
[2019-03-28 20:37:18] <nafg> and slack, and IRC, and email
[2019-03-28 20:37:28] <nafg> they all have different tradeoffs
[2019-03-28 20:37:28] <rebolek> lukeeey: you are using Gitter right now
[2019-03-28 20:37:37] <nafg> how do you know he's a person? ;)
[2019-03-28 20:38:02] <nafg> from the question he must be a bot
[2019-03-28 20:38:10] <rebolek> trolls are persons too :)
[2019-03-28 20:38:24] <nafg> who said anything about trolls
[2019-03-28 20:38:29] <rebolek> me
[2019-03-28 20:39:24] <nafg> real trolls aren't people though
[2019-03-28 20:39:41] <nafg> fortunately real trolls aren't real
[2019-03-28 20:39:55] <rebolek> :)
[2019-03-28 20:45:55] <nafg> lukeeey: why do you ask -- are you considering creating a room?
[2019-03-28 21:19:59] <lukeeey> Nope the android app still isnt good enough for me to want to do that
[2019-03-28 21:20:22] <nafg> yeah it's terrible. Someone please fix it!!
[2019-03-28 21:20:52] <nafg> I get a crash message a few times a day from it, even when I'm not in it
[2019-03-28 21:22:25] <MadLittleMods> @lukeeey @nafg You can track gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-android-app#114We aren't putting our focus on the mobile apps but we welcome a merge request
[2019-03-28 21:22:53] <nafg> Yeah, I welcome one too 
[2019-03-28 21:24:26] <nafg> MadLittleMods: tbh I haven't noticed a lot of improvement coming to the webapp or anything else either
[2019-03-28 21:26:01] <MadLittleMods> @nafg You can see what we have been up to here, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.mdThere is also a rough roadmap (dates not accurate), https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/roadmap?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=Gitter&layout=QUARTERS
[2019-03-28 21:27:39] <nafg> MadLittleMods: looks like a slow trickle of small fixes
[2019-03-28 21:32:23] <MadLittleMods> @nafg Yep, fixes, security issues, some technical debt, infrastructure maintenance, occasional feature, and getting the mobile apps building from CIAnother person is joining the Gitter team in April so I hope that gives us some more bandwidth and a bit more of a rhythm, currently just me
[2019-03-28 21:42:29] <nafg> 
[2019-03-28 21:43:40] <nafg> great to hear, btw didn't mean to sound like I was complaining, just clarifying
[2019-03-30 00:42:01] <kgashok> Thanks much,@MadLittleMods
[2019-03-30 03:11:52] <freakboy3742> Hey folks - I’ve got a Gitter room that is tied to a Github organization. If I rename that organization… what happens to the Gitter room? Is there any way to rename the Gitter room at the same time?
[2019-03-30 03:14:54] <MadLittleMods> freakboy3742: See [<-LINK->] 
[2019-03-30 03:19:23] <freakboy3742> MadLittleMods: Thanks - didn’t find that page poking around the support page. A follow up Q: we were hoping to do the rename by transferring all the individual repositories to the new name, rather than just renaming the org (so we retain ownership of the old name to prevent squatting). From what I’m reading on that FAQ answer, that shouldn’t be a problem - am I correct?
[2019-03-30 03:21:35] <MadLittleMods> freakboy3742: We can rename the whole Gitter community with [<-LINK->] and adjust the security descriptor to the new GitHub org
[2019-03-30 03:24:36] <freakboy3742> MadLittleMods: Ok… that doesn’t really answer my question (or, at least, makes the answer subject to my reading/misreading of some Javascript...)
[2019-03-30 03:25:29] <MadLittleMods> freakboy3742: Sorry for not being clear. It should be fine. Just pointing out the tools we use
[2019-03-30 03:25:32] <freakboy3742> but what I’m seeing suggests there’s no “hard” relationship with Github - the gitter channel name is just a name, which the script will change, along with changing the ownership/membership register?
[2019-03-30 03:26:07] <freakboy3742> All existing channel participants will be members of the new channel name (it’s the same channel, just a different name)
[2019-03-30 03:26:35] <MadLittleMods> freakboy3742: Correct, just changing the name on our side so everything else will be in tact
[2019-03-30 03:27:03] <freakboy3742> Ok - thanks! I guess I'll be in touch in a bit with a renaming request!
[2019-03-30 03:27:08] <MadLittleMods> freakboy3742: How many repos do you plan to move btw?
[2019-03-30 03:28:05] <freakboy3742> There’s probably 80 Githubrepos- but only 3 channels on Gitter.
[2019-03-30 03:28:17] <MadLittleMods> kk, thanks :)
[2019-03-30 03:29:19] <freakboy3742> We don’t have anyrepo-based channels - if we’re just doing the org rename, I presume you don’t need to know all the individual repos as well?
[2019-03-30 03:30:13] <MadLittleMods> @freakboy3742 CorrectEven if you had repo based room, you are transferring the repos on GitHub so the GitHub ID would be the same
[2019-03-30 03:31:27] <freakboy3742> MadLittleMods: Thanks!
[2019-03-30 04:47:10] <roguesec> Is there a better dev and programmer chat than gitter?
[2019-03-30 10:51:12] <lukeeey> Mostly discord
[2019-03-30 17:32:19] <roguesec> Just discord
[2019-03-30 21:23:58] <io7m> hello. i have a small organization on GitHub, and i have a singlecommunitychat room that's intended to be used for all discussion of all projects. each time i add a project, i have to reconfigure the GitHub integration to add the new repository to get notifications in the channel. this is a bit of a pain; i'm publishing lots of new small repositories fairly frequently and will be doing so for the forseeable future. is there some way to get the GitHub integration to automatically pick up new repositories in a GitHub org?
[2019-03-30 21:24:43] <io7m>  [<-LINK->] is the GitHub org, and [<-LINK->] is the channel, in case it matters
[2019-03-30 21:28:47] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] Some more info on setting up a webhook manually, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/2084#workaround
[2019-03-30 21:30:24] <io7m> MadLittleMods: thanks, i'll give it a go
[2019-03-30 21:43:33] <io7m> yep, thanks, it seems to be picking up changes in a new repository without me having to do anything
[2019-03-30 21:44:06] <MadLittleMods> io7m: Merge request welcome to add some docs around the org alternative, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-03-31 10:45:01] <io7m> MadLittleMods: i'll try and put something together
[2019-03-31 12:25:08] <io7m> MadLittleMods: gitlab-org/gitter/webapp!1373
[2019-03-31 12:25:13] <io7m> i think that covers it
[2019-03-31 18:12:58] <MadLittleMods> io7m: Merged  Thanks for the contribution!
[2019-04-01 16:25:09] <JorySchossau> I'm getting errorValidation failedwhen trying to create a room. This is immediately after having made a room with the wrong name and permissions, so I deleted the room. Now I'm making a new room and no matter which permissions I get this error.
[2019-04-01 16:37:19] <JorySchossau> Here's my web console error output showing a 404 error: [<-CODE->] 
[2019-04-01 16:45:57] <JorySchossau> And Chrome error output: [<-CODE->] 
[2019-04-02 13:43:55] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] Relevant code is herehttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/603bebec3eaed038345f423b2c9593510d2be7d1/public/js/models/create-room-view-model.js#L37-43
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/603bebec3eaed038345f423b2c9593510d2be7d1/modules/validators/lib/validate-room-name.js#L6-17
[2019-04-03 10:17:37] <io7m> MadLittleMods: i spoke too soon, i think. the GitHub webhook was delivering events for all repositories in the org, but it seems like as of a couple of days ago, it seems to have stopped. i could recreate the webhook, but i've held off doing that in case there's anything on your end you'd want to debug
[2019-04-03 12:55:08] <MadLittleMods> @io7m Does GitHub still say it is delivering the events since it has stopped?Here are some other reports: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/2084#github-integration-activity-has-stopped-working-for-some-people
[2019-04-04 07:48:09] <io7m> MadLittleMods: it seems that event delivery had stopped on GitHub's side. it was claiming that the webhook URI was returning 404. i checked the token value in the Gitter UI and it didn't match the token that was being used on the GitHub side. no idea how that happened... i've updated the token, so we'll see if delivery resumes
[2019-04-05 14:41:42] <JorySchossau> MadLittleMods: It was a user error in a way - I didn't understand that rooms couldn't have spaces, despite the default room made for me having spaces. The error message didn't help but I know that kind of stuff comes in time. Thanks for getting back to me.
[2019-04-06 17:41:02] <daboe01> cappuccino/cappuccino does not show a current github activity since the beginning of 2019. can you fix this please?
[2019-04-07 09:07:16] <tobozo> hello every one, I'm experiencing issues adding permissions to github users which name contains numbers, is that a known issue ?
[2019-04-07 09:23:18] <tobozo> actually numbers in the username is not a pattern but I have a few username examples that will always fail
[2019-04-07 11:51:45] <pdurbin> What's the error?
[2019-04-07 11:55:19] <tobozo> pdurbin: thanks for your prompt reply, I get this error in the browser
[2019-04-07 11:55:21] <tobozo>  [<-LINK->] 
[2019-04-07 11:55:50] <tobozo> along with a 500 error returned by gitter api
[2019-04-07 11:56:06] <pdurbin> huh, "unhandled rejection"
[2019-04-07 11:56:45] <tobozo> on second call to the same URL, I get an empty response{"results":[]}although I know the user exists
[2019-04-07 11:57:21] <pdurbin> What do you think of [<-ISSUE->] ? Related? Similar?
[2019-04-07 11:57:26] <tobozo> I have captured the internal server error ID if it can be of any use
[2019-04-07 11:58:38] <tobozo> nope, I could add this account to the room, but I can't add it as admin{"error":"Internal Server Error","uniqueId":1554638045172}
[2019-04-07 12:00:06] <tobozo> I see some traffic to sentry.gilab so the error is likely logged somewhere
[2019-04-07 12:05:50] <pdurbin> You should probably open an issue.
[2019-04-07 12:07:11] <tobozo> good, how should I label that ?
[2019-04-07 12:09:05] <tobozo> I mean: can I mention the channel and username examples or do I have to stay abstract
[2019-04-07 12:48:16] <pdurbin> I don't know.
[2019-04-07 13:27:26] <tobozo>  [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-04-07 14:34:21] <tobozo> pdurbin: thanks for you help !
[2019-04-07 15:27:51] <pdurbin> sure, have a good one
[2019-04-07 15:47:21] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @daboe01See this issue and the workaround to set it up again, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-04-07 15:48:55] <MadLittleMods> tobozo: I'm pretty out of office now but will take a look when I am back on next Monday. Thanks for creating the issue
[2019-04-07 15:50:18] <pdurbin> some well earned time off?
[2019-04-07 15:52:35] <MadLittleMods> pdurbin: Just vacation travel, in Korea for a couple of weeks
[2019-04-07 15:56:17] <pdurbin> Wow, nice. The only time I've been to Asia was a trip to Indonesia last year. Enjoy!
[2019-04-07 23:53:16] <brxxn> is it known that approved is spelled wrong under activity?
[2019-04-07 23:54:23] <MadLittleMods> brxxn: I'm not sure exactly what the typo is but if you share the wrong spelling, I can point you to the file in the codebase where you can fix it
[2019-04-07 23:56:00] <brxxn> i'll get to it later
[2019-04-08 01:48:59] <pdurbin> how is it spelled?
[2019-04-08 05:47:28] <daboe01> MadLittleMods: thank you. i do not see the integration item. has this to be done by the room owner?
[2019-04-09 00:19:36] <MadLittleMods> daboe01: Correct, only room owner can setup integrations
[2019-04-10 08:34:22] <vito-c> how do you view previous @ mentions on gitter?
[2019-04-10 10:07:27] <pdurbin> hmm, maybe with a search?
[2019-04-10 19:28:15] <duckydan> Hey. New Gitter user. Just wanted to mention how impressed I am with the iOS app.
[2019-04-10 19:28:29] <duckydan> This is really nice.
[2019-04-11 07:00:14] <abhishalya> MadLittleMods: I'm again facing the problem I reported [<-ISSUE->] a while back.
[2019-04-11 07:05:50] <abhishalya> Although this time I figured why, it is the date-time mismatch. If the time/date doesn't match with the 'expected' it fails on Firefox. Chrome might be using time internally one of its own, Firefox relies on the system time and a probably a conflict causes the Forbidden error.
[2019-04-11 07:10:06] <abhishalya> Mentioned this on the issue page, and closed it^^
[2019-04-11 10:12:48] <arjun-nambiar> how can i use my webapplication to login through gitter
[2019-04-11 10:31:52] <pdurbin> Are you trying to authenticate to the Gitter API?
[2019-04-11 14:36:18] <duckydan> If you log into gitter using GitHub, does it use the notifications emails from GitHub?
[2019-04-13 17:13:45] <grahamperrin>  [<-LINK->] appears empty, at a glance; and [<-LINK->] has nothing more recent than 2019-04-03 – known issue(s)?
[2019-04-13 17:16:00] <grahamperrin> OK, I can manually find my way to e.g. [<-LINK->] but the in-calendar 'heat' mapping  is incomplete
[2019-04-13 17:24:53] <io7m> MadLittleMods: for the record: the GitHub integration is working again
[2019-04-13 23:48:54] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @abhishalyaThanks for the follow-up :slight_smile:
[2019-04-13 23:49:43] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @vito-cYou can search for@vito-c. There isn't a specific syntax outside of that
[2019-04-13 23:50:08] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @duckydanCorrect, primary notification email on GitHub
[2019-04-14 00:07:51] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @grahamperrinThanks for the heads-up. It looks like the Elasticsearch rivers are out of date(2019-04-03) so I'll work on re-building them on Monday. You can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-04-14 01:20:06] <grahamperrin> ty
[2019-04-14 15:52:53] <ftab> Is it supposed to link me to GitHub when I open links that were posted for GitLab? I keep getting 404s and having to manually change the url to gitlab.com
[2019-04-15 00:24:28] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] If you want to get it a bit earlier, you can enable beta testing, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-android-app#early-releases-internal-alpha-beta
[2019-04-15 00:25:48] <ftab> MadLittleMods: iOS and web both, from what I can tell. Haven't tried on android. Does it make a difference that I sign in from GitHub?
[2019-04-15 00:26:06] <ftab> at least, mobile web on my iPhone
[2019-04-15 00:28:37] <ftab> Looks like that is the issue. I'll follow that one, thanks :)
[2019-04-15 00:30:31] <MadLittleMods> @ftab Signing in with GitHub shouldn't cause an issueIt should be working on mobile web. I just tested with a GitHub account and a GitLab issue.I'd expect it to be not working in the iOS app though
[2019-04-15 00:33:02] <ftab> Hmmmmmm. Weird. Works fine on mobile web in some rooms but not GitLab's
[2019-04-15 00:33:27] <ftab>  [<-LINK->] 
[2019-04-15 00:41:03] <ftab> I seem to recall something about that room being linked to the GitLab group on github, desktop was showing a list of github issues for it
[2019-04-15 00:41:29] <ftab> at least when I first joined
[2019-04-15 00:42:17] <MadLittleMods> ftab: It's because that person wrotegitlab-org/gitlab-ce#27344in the message which we assume is a GitHub reference if no domain is present (thanks for the example)
[2019-04-15 00:46:36] <ftab> MadLittleMods: thanks, makes sense :) I wonder if that could be tuned for each room, depending on if the project uses GitLab or GitHub
[2019-04-15 00:57:02] <MadLittleMods> ftab: You can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-04-15 01:17:56] <ftab> /me does the walk of shame back to the search box. Sorry  figures you'd have already had an issue for that!
[2019-04-15 15:56:29] <OsamaEhsan> Hi, can i know why some of the chatrooms have activity panels on right side and others don't ?
[2019-04-15 15:57:34] <MadLittleMods> OsamaEhsan: Some rooms may not have any integrations setup
[2019-04-15 15:59:58] <OsamaEhsan> MadLittleMods: does gitter API provides any information about the private chatrooms ?
[2019-04-15 16:29:54] <MadLittleMods> OsamaEhsan: The API will give a 403/404 for things you don't have access to

[2019-04-15 16:40:23] <MarkoShiva> thx
[2019-04-17 06:47:58] <mysmlz> Why do I still receive notification after uninstallation?
[2019-04-17 07:04:56] <MadLittleMods> @mysmlz If you are on Windows, gitlab-org/gitter/desktop#175Otherwise, you may still have the app running in the background and need to exit

[2019-04-17 17:42:23] <MadLittleMods> ghost: ~5cb1f4f3d73408ce4fbda091 I'm not sure what you mean by "dp", can you expand on it?
[2019-04-18 00:09:33] <vshantha> Trying to implement Gitter for my org but email notifications dont seem to work. Any help is appreciated!
[2019-04-18 02:59:22] <MadLittleMods> vshantha: What's not working about them? What are you expecting to happen? [<-LINK->] 
[2019-04-18 03:19:26] <vshantha> I am expecting that I get an email notification when someone posts a message directly to me. But it has not worked until now. I went through the doc and made sure I have selected the right notifications. Maybe I am expecting something that is not available. Please let me know if that is the case.
[2019-04-18 03:19:44] <vshantha> MadLittleMods: 
[2019-04-18 03:22:48] <MadLittleMods> vshantha: Emails notifications are batched up every hour and sent. If you read the one to one message before the batch is started, then you won't get an email
[2019-04-18 03:23:37] <MadLittleMods> vshantha: Also check to make sure you are not unsubscribed, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-04-18 03:26:23] <vshantha> MadLittleMods: Thanks Eric! is there anyway I can get instant notification if someone directly posts?
[2019-04-18 03:27:54] <vshantha> Also any means to search through the chat to find specific terms?
[2019-04-18 05:14:48] <MadLittleMods> @vshantha You can track for notifications,gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#130

[2019-04-18 05:16:32] <MadLittleMods> mahin1234: This room is for Gitter support only. Given you also posted in the other room,  [<-LINK->] , I assume you have unrelated problems and should stay there. [<-LINK->] your question right away

[2019-04-23 22:56:23] <MadLittleMods> @sebbu2  Related to gitlab-org/gitter/services#99Mind creating an issue? https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/services/issuesThe relevant code is here if you are interesting in fixing it, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/services/blob/1385f83be1d8fdaea298244022fc9c39da9be7c0/lib/gitlab/index.js#L17-31
[2019-04-24 20:10:04] <vshantha> I have problems getting notifications from Gitter. I created a Github account using a Distributed List and then logged in on Gitter to create the room. I have also setup all necessary notifications default settings. Is there anything that I am missing?
[2019-04-24 20:11:16] <MadLittleMods> @vshantha What notifications are you expecting to happen?Docs on notifications: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/notifications.md
[2019-04-24 20:16:09] <vshantha> I am just hoping the members in the DL get a notification in case some asks any questions. Right now I have to keep checking to see if there are any questions since I dont get any n otifications
[2019-04-24 20:18:43] <MadLittleMods> vshantha: What kind of notifications are you not getting (browser notification, email, etc)? What are your notification settings set to?
[2019-04-24 20:21:04] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
[2019-04-24 20:24:40] <vshantha> MadLittleMods: Email notifications. Currently set to ALL.
[2019-04-24 20:28:34] <MadLittleMods> vshantha: Email notifications are batched up and sent in 1 hour chunks. If you leave the message unread for a couple hours, do you get an email?
[2019-04-24 21:04:05] <vshantha> MadLittleMods: Nope i tried several times but it never worked.
[2019-04-24 21:09:22] <vshantha> MadLittleMods: Although to test I had logged in using my personal email and I got notifications there. Wondering if its because of the DL (It works with other external emails though)
[2019-04-24 21:40:45] <MadLittleMods> vshantha: What is DL? If you are using the [<-LINK->] it will mark every message as read so you won't get any emails
[2019-04-24 21:52:20] <vshantha> DL is my Email Distribution List
[2019-04-24 21:58:34] <MadLittleMods> For@vshantha, the last unread email was sent out on April 19th. I'll send you a one to one message that you can leave unread to see if you get an email
[2019-04-24 22:21:31] <pdurbin> the irc bridge is the best :)
[2019-04-24 23:20:40] <MadLittleMods> vshantha: I see a new unread notification email sent just now. It sounds like your notification settings are good,All, so maybe you are just reading the messages before the 1 hour batched email goes out?
[2019-04-24 23:40:34] <pdurbin> Did you ever hire another developer@MadLittleMods?
[2019-04-24 23:42:30] <MadLittleMods> pdurbin: Yep :slight_smile: Started last Monday ->@viktomas [<-LINK->] 
[2019-04-24 23:43:40] <pdurbin> nice!
[2019-04-24 23:45:15] <pdurbin> Any more thoughts on self hosting? Do you think it could happen some day? As a supported feature, I mean. Or at least possible or not too hard.
[2019-04-24 23:55:25] <vshantha> MadLittleMods: Yes I got the email. It works with this account but I was talking about my other professional account. Let me log into it and initiate a chat. Maybe you can do the same and let me know if you can see the notification sent out.
[2019-04-25 00:01:03] <walmartio-support> MadLittleMods: Vshantha here. This is the account I am needing help with.
[2019-04-25 00:33:40] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @pdurbinMaybe but it's very far off in any case, [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-04-25 00:35:33] <MadLittleMods> vshantha: I see emails going out today to@walmartio-supportwith delivered status. If you're not receiving them, then it seems like it's on your end
[2019-04-25 00:41:44] <pdurbin> ok, bummer, I'll just keep using the only instance, thanks
[2019-04-25 00:47:55] <pdurbin> I really believe in what Gitter is doing. I'm just sad that there's only one installation in the world. :(
[2019-04-25 00:48:04] <pdurbin> So much potential.
[2019-04-25 00:49:18] <MadLittleMods> pdurbin: Are you interested in something separate on it's own or federated/distributed?
[2019-04-25 00:49:53] <pdurbin> Gitter should be like GitLab. People should be able to install it.
[2019-04-25 00:50:19] <pdurbin> Right?
[2019-04-25 00:51:26] <MadLittleMods> pdurbin: Okay, sounds like something separate
[2019-04-25 00:51:27] <pdurbin> Just like Wordpress, Jenkins, etc.
[2019-04-25 00:54:26] <vshantha> MadLittleMods: Thanks Eric I will look into it. Maybe its getting filtered somehow.
[2019-04-25 00:56:37] <pdurbin> I mean, I get that Gitter was a startup. It was like Slack for open source or something. Slack for GitHub projects. I guess no one ever dreamed that anyone would want their own installation that they have control over. It was designed as software as a service, not a piece of software you download and install like Wordpress or Jenkins. I was disappointed when I learned this.
[2019-04-25 00:56:39] <pdurbin> When I got the code running on my laptop. My heart sank. :(
[2019-04-25 01:22:07] <pdurbin> I thought to myself, "Why would I want to contribute to this thing?"
[2019-04-25 01:47:47] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @sebbu2I created a fix for theundefinedGitLab activity (still needs to be reviewed, merged, shipped). Thanks for the nudgegitlab-org/gitter/services!103
[2019-04-25 01:56:23] <sebbu2> \o/
[2019-04-25 16:39:21] <ftab> @pdurbin if you're aiming for something your team can use to communicate internally like a Slack, you might be trying to use the wrong thing. Otherwise, if it's an open source project, while I share the appeal of controlling everything yourself, what's wrong with hosting its channels on Gitter.im? Makes it easier for contributors and chatters to sign in and only have one place to keep track of for the various open source projects they're following.I know GitLab acquired it and announced the open sourcing of the code, but holding it to a high standard like that of GitLab itself is probably a bit lopsided; GitLab started out as open source from the beginning and has thousands of contributors over the years who've made it even easier to set up your own instance (in its early years, it wasn't quite there).Gitter could very well get there eventually, but only if people see the potential and try to help make it better. I would encourage you to open issues for anything you ran into while trying to get it running, even if you don't have the time to fix it.
[2019-04-25 16:53:26] <ftab> If it's where the audience is, probably best to just continue to use it. For the longest time I clung onto my IRC server for my game because it's mine and I can control it, add stuff to it, but everyone had moved over into separate Discords because it's easier than IRC and has more stuff to play with. There's like 1 or 2 die hard IRC holdouts (one just reminded me I need to get a real SSL certificate ), but the game community basically threw a party when I finally set up a Discord server for the game
[2019-04-25 17:14:14] <pdurbin> ftab: sorry, to be clear, I'm a huge Gitter supporter and user and have no plans to stop participating here on the only instance. I got the code running on my laptop and made a small code contribution. I'll continue to participate in the issue tracker and all that. I'm just saying that if Gitter were my project, I would prioritize self hosting to bring in contributors.
[2019-04-25 17:35:44] <ftab> ah ok
[2019-04-25 17:41:32] <pdurbin> :)
[2019-04-25 17:43:22] <pdurbin> I'm one of those IRC hold outs. I setup a channel on freenode 6 years ago that is still very actively used. When I set it up I also set up a logging bot so that there are public logs just like Gitter has.
[2019-04-25 17:49:18] <pdurbin> I guess you are saying I should embrace the network effect.
[2019-04-25 17:53:16] <pdurbin> The centralization.
[2019-04-25 17:53:53] <pdurbin> Like I have with GitHub.
[2019-04-25 17:54:06] <pdurbin> And freenode.
[2019-04-25 18:57:01] <ftab> Yeah. At least with freenode, there's already people there and all they'd have to do is /join #channel - unless you're in a business that has to keep highly guarded secrets, I feel like there is diminishing value in running your own things. I've been contributing to GitLab to give back, and I still run a private GitLab CE instance for any of work's stuff that can't be open sourced due to NDAs and whatnot, but the best place I can think of to host an open source project is GitLab.com because of the existing user base there and the free enterprise features given to all public projects
[2019-04-25 18:57:57] <ftab> Centralized doesn't have to mean closed though. The fact that I could still contribute to the enterprise features even if I am not a licensee, kinda blows my mind
[2019-04-25 19:57:18] <pdurbin> Interesting. Nothing against gitlab.com but the best place I can think of to host an open source project in 2019 is github.com. Again, I've embraced the centralization when it comes to GitHub. The network effect is powerful. I just hope that self hosting makes it on Gitter's roadmap some day.
[2019-04-26 00:39:39] <pdurbin> ftab: and cool that you're a contributor to gi.
[2019-04-26 00:39:43] <pdurbin> tlab
[2019-04-29 10:35:42] <parthi2929> Hi, I ask this question after searching elsewhere but could not get an answer. I created a community and a room. Room appears to be private. But how do I make it private not to all github users, but only to those few selected github users?
[2019-04-29 10:36:47] <parthi2929> I mean, the room chat should not appear for any public or github user, but only to those members of the room, and those members are only selected github users, not all github users. This distinction is missing in room settings.
[2019-04-29 15:40:59] <MadLittleMods> @parthi2929 You just have to add/invite those few GitHub users to the room, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/rooms.md#peoplerosterAre you looking for something different? You can make a private room that is only visible to members of the GitHub org https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/rooms.md#room-security
[2019-04-29 16:00:00] <carlosalberto> Hey all - I'm having problems with autocomplete being essentially usable-less. I'm in a room, say, with 600 people, and doing an autocomplete with "@j" shows me one guy, who, btw, is barely active. This results in me going and checking the username of the guy I want to talk to in Github.com, copy, and paste it back (or else, look for him in my private message list, if any).Is this how autocomplete is supposed to work, maybe because due to a limitation? Thanks.
[2019-04-29 16:04:53] <MadLittleMods> @carlosalberto If the user sent a message recently, they should be first in the listHere are some relevant issues,gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1179

[2019-05-01 20:31:59] <Half-Shot> Hiya, seem to be having some issues with@matrixbotagain. I suspect it was a side effect of us starting the bot, but it can't send messages to gitter anymore. Requests seem to succeed but do not appear on gitter. I guess it's banned/
[2019-05-01 20:32:00] <Half-Shot> *?
[2019-05-01 21:11:17] <MadLittleMods> Half-Shot: matrixbotwas banned and probably picked up in our spam detection for sending the same message over and over. I have unbannedmatrixbot
[2019-05-01 21:15:35] <Half-Shot> Thank you :)
[2019-05-01 22:08:47] <vshantha> Is there anyway to label questions on Gitter and archive them seperately? Basically what I am looking for is a way to categorize the questions raised by the users.
[2019-05-01 22:10:10] <MadLittleMods> @vshantha Sounds a bit like you are looking for threaded discussions, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#741Here is the issue to track for labeling/tagging messages: gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1008

[2019-05-02 08:43:57] <ftab> i'd give my right arm for an edit/delete button in the mobile app!
[2019-05-02 08:44:56] <ftab> just wound up accidentally spamming a channel a couple times after iOS's keyboard helpfully prefilled a word and then my finger somehow wound up hitting a send button
[2019-05-02 08:45:33] <ftab> aha, the done button
[2019-05-02 08:46:47] <ftab> was trying the mobile web to see if there was an edit/delete button
[2019-05-02 08:46:57] <ftab> and "done" actually means "send"
[2019-05-02 13:02:27] <pdurbin> Gitter is such an inspiration for me. I just created this "Document how to set up a Gitter-like user experience" issue: [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-05-02 15:39:36] <ftab> MadLittleMods: just a little heads up for your metadata thing - [<-LINK->] I was in the neighborhood and saw you were looking for a way to download the existing stuff with fastlane, thought it might be useful
[2019-05-02 17:10:17] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @ftabYou can double tap on a message to edit it. Although sometimes it's a bit tricky [<-LINK->] 
[2019-05-02 17:11:43] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @ftabThanks for the metadatafastlanetip!
[2019-05-03 08:20:37] <gajus> 
[2019-05-03 15:47:36] <ftab> MadLittleMods: no prob! If you need another TestFlight tester I'd be happy to help.fury@xibase.com
[2019-05-03 15:49:50] <ftab> though I have a Mac and several iOS devices and may be able to build it myself to test, now that I think of it
[2019-05-03 17:29:49] <MadLittleMods> @ftab I added you as an external tester and the TestFlight build is currently under review. I am wondering if the chat message input is still working or just a problem in the simulator, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-ios-app/merge_requests/6#note_166342138I suspect it is an actual bug  
[2019-05-04 02:43:34] <helxsz> I am new to gitter, I looked into the code but still have no idea how it build the real time chat, is it by using the socket.io ?
[2019-05-04 08:09:52] <MadLittleMods> helxsz: It's using Bayeux/Faye/Websockets. Here is the relevant code,https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/realtime-client
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/halley
[2019-05-04 14:51:56] <helxsz> thanks@MadLittleMods
[2019-05-06 00:36:12] <janicez> i'm exhausted
[2019-05-06 00:36:42] <pdurbin> Gitter wore you out? :)
[2019-05-06 00:37:48] <janicez> Not even!
[2019-05-06 00:37:55] <janicez> yeah I prefer IRC anyway
[2019-05-06 00:40:29] <pdurbin> The Gitter IRC bridge is the best.
[2019-05-06 16:31:14] <Kontributer> The iOS app is so frustrating for iPhone 6, 6+, 7. I hope I may voice those frustrations here. They include: code scrolling (when a code block is too wide, sometimes it won’t scroll at all) comments that do not post after hitting send — everything written must be rewritten, which is problematic when remembering a somewhat lengthy comment @mentions sometimes are difficult to find the target when their names differ from their handle linking to previous comments is difficult quoting comments may be not existent automatically marking unread posts as read sometimes requires leaving the room and rejoining (sometimes you don’t want to mark all as read)I’m sure there are countless others, but this is the list for now as I vent :) Thanks for hearing me out.
[2019-05-06 16:49:03] <MadLittleMods> Kontributer: Here are some issues you can track,Code not scrollable, gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-ios-app#8
"comments that do not post after hitting send" -> I am not sure what you mean with this point. If a message fails to send, it will turn red and you should be able to retry
Show @mention/username/handle next to display name, gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-ios-app#22
Message actions like linking/quoting, gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-ios-app#35
Sometimes you have to focus the chat frame or scroll a bit in order for the unreads to realize you are seeing them. I just created this issue for using a new API which would be good to explore to make this more accurate, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#2131
[2019-05-06 16:53:51] <cbj4074> Has anyone else noticed that Alt-clicking timestamps to insert links into the chat input field stops working periodically? Restarting the Gitter client (I'm using the desktop client) fixes the issue.
[2019-05-06 16:54:16] <cbj4074> I'll check the Console next time and see if an error is generated when it fails to work correctly.
[2019-05-06 16:55:21] <MadLittleMods> cbj4074: I've experienced that but thought it just may be a long-running process borked alt on Chrome/Windows bug. Mind creating an issue so we can start tracking it? [<-LINK->] 
[2019-05-06 16:56:23] <cbj4074> MadLittleMods: Not at all. I'll do that now.
[2019-05-06 16:57:33] <cbj4074> Do you experience the problem outside of the desktop client (i.e., in a regular browser)?
[2019-05-06 16:57:47] <cbj4074> I'm just wondering if I should mention that it seems to be specific to the desktop client or not.
[2019-05-06 16:58:47] <MadLittleMods> cbj4074: Ye, regular Chrome browser but the desktop client on Windows/Linux is Chromium. I can add a debug log to [<-LINK->] so we can turn on logging when it happens and see if the event shows the alt key as being pushed
[2019-05-06 17:00:00] <cbj4074> Okay, nice. [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-05-06 17:11:37] <Kontributer> @MadLittleMods thank you for that, I hope that wasn’t too much effort.The scrolling doesn’t work, it does sometimes but not nearly as often as it should. Even now for this reply, there are several message that won’t fade. It requires leaving and coming back to give that “read” impression, even if scrolling back into history and then back to the item. My guess is that might be by design when multiple new comments exist to ensure opening a room doesn’t count as reading the message? Maybe not. Whatever the case, the desktop experience is much nicer.Regarding the unposted text, it may be a coaching issue. When I have closed the app and then come back, I have notice that the text may be there. Switching rooms was not enough. I suppose this means it wasn’t an error, but maybe a race condition when hitting send (or limitations of cache with these older devices)?While showing the username would be nice, targeting it (on click insertion at text cursor) would also be nice.And, 1 follow up, sometimes I hold down the time stamp to copy the comment URL, since quoting is not available. Sometimes user error or a slip is made and Gitter follows the link, opening it in the web browser. It would be nice if that wasn’t automatic, if there was confirmation made before leaving the app.Thanks again!
[2019-05-06 17:19:36] <MadLittleMods> @Kontributer The webapp experience gets a lot more love than the mobile apps.Clicking the username already appends in the webapp and this sounds great for the mobile apps.
[2019-05-06 17:35:43] <Kontributer> Aww browser-   That’s nice to see. I was thinking Gitter might have been created with React Native to make it a quick update.I’ll add that one of the factors that went into voicing my recent frustrations was hoping some of these could be addressed at the upcoming Gitlab hackathon. :)
[2019-05-06 17:51:09] <MadLittleMods> @Kontributer The mobile apps are a hybrid so the webapp chat frame is embedded in the Android/iOS app. [<-CODE->] Appending the username to the input could also be somewhat addressed but the iOS app is using a native chat message input so we would need to fire off an event in the webapp chat frame and let the native iOS part fill it in. Create an issue and I can try to link some relevant code
[2019-05-07 13:31:17] <phildini> Hi there! I seem to have lost access to a room that I should have access to for my github org.
[2019-05-07 13:31:25] <phildini> Is someone behind-the-scenes at gitter able to help?
[2019-05-07 14:12:38] <MadLittleMods> phildini: Which GitHub org? Which Gitter room? Here are some steps to follow, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-05-07 14:13:46] <phildini> MadLittleMods: I am an owner of the beeware organization, but can't access the main Beeware room.

[2019-05-07 14:19:33] <phildini> MadLittleMods: I think I have followed all of those steps.
[2019-05-07 14:20:43] <MadLittleMods> @phildini Did you check the GitHub settings on your personal account and on the org (linked in that FAQ)? Do you see both public and private scopes in both places?Your org membership is not public https://github.com/orgs/beeware/people
[2019-05-07 14:24:00] <phildini> Ahhh! That worked, thanks!
[2019-05-07 20:05:11] <Kontributer> Eric is killing Gitter support service quotas
[2019-05-07 20:08:53] <pdurbin> What does that mean? Killing quotas?
[2019-05-07 20:58:41] <cbj4074> Is that like "crushing" them, i.e., surpassing expectations with respect thereto?
[2019-05-12 04:04:33] <srnb_gitlab> By trying to embed a video in gitter, I can make a blank message

[2019-05-12 19:58:28] <ghost~5c6d7e88d73408ce4fb8645c> Do you consider gitter as think fit an internet-cafe for hackers? Is gitter fairly round for hackers in terms of HQ?
[2019-05-12 20:05:57] <pdurbin> HQ? Headquarters? Sure, I think Gitter is a great place for hackers. :)
[2019-05-12 20:11:46] <ghost~5c6d7e88d73408ce4fb8645c> Thanks, I think the answers give a better understanding of what we are dealing with.
[2019-05-12 20:17:45] <pdurbin> sure
[2019-05-13 02:56:57] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @srnb_gitlabThere are multiple ways to make a blank message like posting a non-printable character like a ZWJ. Are you seeing any problems caused by it?
[2019-05-13 03:05:53] <srnb_gitlab> That I can't embed a video :^)
[2019-05-13 03:06:47] <srnb_gitlab> But no, I haven't encountered any blank message problems

[2019-05-13 11:00:42] <AdmiralSnyder> hi, is the text selection problem with the gitter website in MS Edge something that also happens in other browsers? I did not find an open issue with the keywords "text select"...
[2019-05-13 14:48:59] <MadLittleMods> AdmiralSnyder: Can you expand on what the problem is?
[2019-05-13 15:35:19] <AdmiralSnyder> when i try to select something with the mouse, everything is being selected.
[2019-05-13 15:41:52] <MadLittleMods> Thanks for the report, I created an issue to track this@AdmiralSnyder [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-05-13 15:42:59] <AdmiralSnyder> i'll put a gif there.
[2019-05-13 15:52:21] <AdmiralSnyder> oh. it's already there. nice. thanks.
[2019-05-13 17:59:37] <ghost~5c6d7e88d73408ce4fb8645c> Is it possible to prohibit the insertion of video in the chat, as a significant distinction chat of the IT specialists? Does the majority of Gitter users approve of this idea as a convenient advantage over all other similar services?
[2019-05-13 18:00:34] <aviflax> I’m trying to create a room and getting “Validation Failed” but I don’t understand what’s failing or why, or what I can do about it.
[2019-05-13 18:00:42] <aviflax>  [<-LINK->] 
[2019-05-13 18:05:21] <aviflax> Looks like maybe the issue was I had had a space in the room name. I reloaded the page and tried again and was able to create the room. So maybe just a bug report that the UX here could use a little improvement.
[2019-05-13 19:08:34] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @usuanu_twitterYouTube videos [<-LINK->] and their isn't [<-LINK->] yet. If you don't want people linking videos, you should make it a room rule and ban people who don't follow it

[2019-05-13 19:54:25] <MadLittleMods> @usuanu_twitter It's a manual moderation policy. Just add it to your rooms topic/description or welcome message, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/rooms.md#room-topicdescriptionIf it's not your room, you will need to ask of of the room admins

[2019-05-13 20:23:43] <ftab> we mess around with hardware at work, usually microcontroller based, I've been looking to do some DevOps of Things (DooT!)
[2019-05-13 20:27:24] <MadLittleMods> @ftab Not sure how nicely Xilinx plays with CI ♀. Really benefits from a fast single coreRelated blog post, https://about.gitlab.com/2018/06/29/introducing-auto-breakfast-from-gitlab/
[2019-05-13 20:28:03] <ftab> Awesome
[2019-05-13 20:28:48] <ftab> Well, I don't have fast single core, but I have 20 hyperthreaded cores at 2.2 GHz on my CI runner...
[2019-05-13 20:28:55] <ftab> I could make 40 breakfasts at once!
[2019-05-13 20:31:02] <ftab> that reminds me...number one complaint around the office is that the coffee pot is empty, i could probably make a pipeline to auto refill it
[2019-05-13 20:31:33] <ftab> i don't drink coffee, but i know how to make little computers talk to other little computers! gimme an arduino and 2 hours and I can make a PCB exit sensor for an oven that didn't come with one...
[2019-05-13 20:32:15] <ftab> (well, and a few infrared break sensors)

[2019-05-14 18:43:58] <gregBerthelot> MadLittleMods: Thanks
[2019-05-15 07:49:27] <zhuangsen> hi
[2019-05-15 12:55:40] <viktomas> 
[2019-05-15 16:50:27] <starlight-chaser> Question- I have 2 github accounts and I think this app auto logged me into the wrong account. 1. How do I confirm which account it logged me into? 2. If wrong account, how do I change that? I see no place to log out or look at profile.
[2019-05-15 16:51:02] <starlight-chaser> This is the iOS app for Gitter.
[2019-05-15 16:54:11] <ftab> starlight-chaser: from what I remember, you have to use the iOS settings app to sign out. Scroll through the apps list at the bottom, Gitter has a switch for "sign out". If starlight-chaser is the wrong account, then sign out
[2019-05-15 16:54:43] <ftab> I think you may need to sign out of GitHub from safari in order to change which account you're signing in from
[2019-05-15 16:55:29] <MadLittleMods> @starlight-chaser The sign out option is in the iOS apps settings. I don't think there is a way to figure out which account you are using without sending a message. You can use https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/sandbox if you need a scratch place
[2019-05-15 16:56:34] <fullofcaffeine> Is there a way to link to a message?
[2019-05-15 16:57:03] <MadLittleMods> fullofcaffeine: Yes, see [<-LINK->] 
[2019-05-15 16:57:09] <fullofcaffeine> It'd be super useful to refer to or archive information. When I want to save useful piece of data or convo I need to copy the whole thing now
[2019-05-15 16:57:13] <fullofcaffeine> Ah nice, thanks!
[2019-05-15 16:57:30] <starlight-chaser> Thanks Dennis! You answered both my questions!
[2019-05-15 16:58:01] <starlight-chaser> Thank you Eric for the visual. That helps.
[2019-05-15 16:59:26] <ftab> the iOS app does not show the actual account name, you have to wait til someone mentions you or you can try searching for yourself by typing an @ and looking for your name
[2019-05-15 17:00:12] <ftab> I guess it doesn't show yourself in the mention suggestions tho.
[2019-05-15 17:00:24] <ftab> ftab: is nowhere to be found :D
[2019-05-15 17:07:26] <starlight-chaser> Yeah, it doesn't seem to tell me what your username is so I can tag you.
[2019-05-15 17:08:02] <starlight-chaser> So I CAN'T tag you is what I meant
[2019-05-15 17:09:42] <MadLittleMods> starlight-chaser: You can track this issue for usernames next to display names, [<-ISSUE->] and general issue around typeahead, [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-05-15 17:10:24] <starlight-chaser> Ok. Thank you!

[2019-05-15 20:04:03] <cbj4074> MadLittleMods: Perfect, I'll follow that Issue. Thank you!
[2019-05-16 20:44:00] <ghost~5c6d7e88d73408ce4fb8645c> ftab: Hi white collar! It happens that you can make so many breakfasts, it is something like an office bartender. Do you have a photo of your the a office workstation, which could be known "familiar side by side"?
[2019-05-17 20:18:07] <ghost~5cdf12e6d73408ce4fc09bb2> Does anyone know if there plans to make the 'create room' functionality of the api public?
[2019-05-17 22:09:00] <MadLittleMods> ostensiblycool_gitlab: You can mimic whatever the create room flow is doing in the UI. It's just that there is no guarantee it will stay the samehttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/b3da5ce784ae949c8273b85a62791ebffc7d1ca4/server/api/v1/groups/rooms.js#L80-113

[2019-05-19 22:41:54] <velara3> how do i change settings on my profile?
[2019-05-20 00:38:59] <MadLittleMods> velara3: What do you want to change? We pull your info from GitHub, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-05-20 00:41:53] <velara3> I want to change my username on here
[2019-05-20 01:20:58] <cbj4074> velara3: It's tied to your GitHub username, so you'd have to change it on GitHub.
[2019-05-20 01:21:09] <cbj4074> (that's my understanding, anyway)
[2019-05-20 01:21:55] <MadLittleMods> @velara3 Your username matches whatever you have on GitHub, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/accounts.md#can-i-change-my-username
[2019-05-20 12:25:02] <nicsachin> i want to pass this array in props how can i do this
[2019-05-20 14:55:14] <viktomas> nicsachin: you can ask general software development questions in [<-LINK->] , this room is meant for support of the gitter.im itself  :slight_smile:
[2019-05-20 15:26:09] <ghost~5ce0447fd73408ce4fc0bbd1> How much time must pass to synchronize in gitter after changing avatar or name, if I log in via Twitter? Are they synchronized at all? Or is this problem solved radically by deleting the account itself?
[2019-05-20 16:02:21] <MadLittleMods> @Sindeing_Hiotsh_twitter Should just need to sign out and back in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/accounts.md#how-do-i-update-my-avatarBut it doesn't work for Twitter so you can send a message to support@gitter.im
[2019-05-21 12:41:49] <cbj4074> Nortb__twitter: @cpumetaThis really isn't the place to be discussing subjects unrelated to support regarding the Gitter client itself.
[2019-05-21 12:42:10] <Nortb__twitter> Oh sorry@cbj4074
[2019-05-21 12:43:40] <cbj4074> No problem, just pointing it out. 
[2019-05-22 09:01:39] <alextooter> Hi, How can I enlarge the display font? I can’t see current small font clearly.
[2019-05-22 11:11:26] <viktomas> alextooter: as far as I know Gitter doen't support custom font size. The next best thing is going to be zooming in the website (Cmd++on mac orCtrl++)
[2019-05-22 11:12:37] <alextooter> viktomas: Thanks
[2019-05-22 14:09:56] <schwedenmut_gitlab> Hi@all, while working on GitLab OAuth integration for the Android application I noticed, that if using latest commit from the webapp development branch the output ofnpm run build-android-assetshas no input field after building the android application. When using the latest tag from webapp master branch it works as expected.Should this suffice to create an issue in both repositories?I didn't find any tests for that so I am not sure if this will be considered before the next release.
[2019-05-22 14:20:14] <viktomas> Hey@schwedenmut_gitlab, could you please try to run the task on commitgitlab-org/gitter/webapp@147bbd2and then ongitlab-org/gitter/webapp@80873d1. The second commit introduced Vue to the codebase and it's the only large UI change that has been done since the last release (tag).
[2019-05-22 15:23:01] <schwedenmut_gitlab> viktomas: thanks for the suggestion , I will try and reply with the results.
[2019-05-22 16:50:57] <schwedenmut_gitlab> viktomas: just did a cleanpull,npm installandnpm run build-android-assetsongitlab-org/gitter/webapp@147bbd2which worked as a charm. So I guess, this was an layer 8 error ♂..Thank you for the support.
[2019-05-23 09:21:46] <viktomas> schwedenmut_gitlab: No problem :)  Can you still try to run the task ongitlab-org/gitter/webapp@80873d1It is the commit that introduced the large UI change (touching webpack). I was expecting the first commit (gitlab-org/gitter/webapp@147bbd2) to be OK.
[2019-05-23 10:21:48] <schwedenmut_gitlab> viktomas: just did agit checkout 80873d1on the webapp repo, followed bynpm install,npm startand annpm run build-android-assets. Moved those assets to the gitter-android project, build that one and worked without problems on both the emulator and a pixel 2 with latest pre Q Android.I don’t know what I have done wrong in the first place, but was only a false alert. All is good :)
[2019-05-23 11:54:05] <viktomas> schwedenmut_gitlab: awesome :) glad I could help
[2019-05-26 18:27:05] <vegegoku> HiHow can i rename a room?

[2019-05-28 16:18:12] <nileshtrivedi> Is this roadmap up to date: [<-LINK->] ? Are threaded conversations coming soon?
[2019-05-28 16:35:20] <MadLittleMods> nileshtrivedi: Next thing on the list :slight_smile:  We are having a meeting this Thursday to discuss threading with UX
[2019-05-28 16:38:25] <nileshtrivedi> Awesome!  I was so torn between having to choose between Slack and Discord - both being proprietary. Gitter seems almost perfect for our non-developer community now. Even Matrix has a bridge to Gitter which expands the options for client apps. 
[2019-05-29 06:25:26] <nileshtrivedi> Only concern now is not having options other than GitHub, GitLab, Twitter for signing up. For non-tech users, Twitter becomes the only option. Any plans around this?
[2019-05-29 08:12:18] <viktomas> There is an epic on our roadmap to support users with multiple identities [<-LINK->] . :slight_smile:  The refactoring done as a part of this epic makes adding new OAuth providers easier but that being said, I'm not aware of another OAuth provider being considered.

[2019-05-29 12:12:02] <paris-ci> Take your time lol, don't worry
[2019-05-29 12:31:20] <viktomas> paris-ci: can you try open private tab in your browser and login to gitter.im using your github account? :slight_smile: my suspicion when looking at the code is that you got a temporary access just by clicking through the email
[2019-05-29 12:33:21] <paris-ci> This is me on a private window
[2019-05-29 12:33:38] <paris-ci> Don't look like it worked :(@viktomas
[2019-05-29 13:07:27] <viktomas> paris-ci: I was trying to reproduce logging in with an invite, no success. You are a magician. I've created an issue and I'll look into it tomorrow: [<-ISSUE->] :slight_smile:
[2019-05-29 13:14:43] <paris-ci> Wow
[2019-05-29 13:14:51] <paris-ci> Sorry for breaking everything
[2019-05-30 12:27:00] <MadLittleMods> paris-ci: Just [<-LINK->] so you shouldn't be an a limbo invited state anymore. We don't know the reproduction steps yet though
[2019-05-30 12:30:44] <viktomas> 
[2019-05-30 14:40:58] <paris-ci> Thanks!
[2019-05-30 14:42:52] <paris-ci> I can now also open private chats, so it seems solved for me :)
[2019-05-31 03:30:18] <liveHarshit> The app should with all features as in web plateform
[2019-05-31 07:46:49] <MadLittleMods> @liveHarshit What features are you missing in particular?We aren't focusing on the Android/iOS apps but they are open source if you want to add some featurehttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-android-app
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-ios-app
[2019-05-31 11:37:59] <liveHarshit> they are open source if you want to add some featureOh it's cool. And that server documentation? I want Read by, edit and delete functionality in the mobile app.
[2019-05-31 11:39:20] <MadLittleMods> @liveHarshit You can edit a message by double tapping on it, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/mobile-apps.md#edit-message [<-CODE->] 
[2019-05-31 11:40:38] <liveHarshit> Okay thanks. Looking forward to contribute.
[2019-05-31 11:41:03] <pdurbin> Double tap test. It works!
[2019-06-01 04:47:24] <parthi2929> Is there a way to change the name of the community we create and then inside, the rooms names? (sounds trivial, but i could not find the options)
[2019-06-02 01:10:54] <engelmav> this is so cool
[2019-06-02 01:12:03] <MadLittleMods> parthi2929: Seehttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/communities.md#rename-a-community
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/rooms.md#rename-a-room
[2019-06-02 05:31:09] <skvithalani> Hello, is this an appropriate place to suggest a feature on gitter channels? The suggestion is that can we have threads in gitter conversation similar to google chats. This can help someone know what comment is of which discssuion in a quite intuitive way rather that reading each comment and manually linking them to discussions?
[2019-06-02 06:51:55] <MadLittleMods> skvithalani: This is correct place  Threads is next on the list! We just had a meeting on Thursday to discuss details with UX. The epic to track threaded discussions is here [<-LINK->] 
[2019-06-02 07:54:54] <skvithalani> MadLittleMods: great . Thanks.
[2019-06-02 11:31:20] <parthi2929> MadLittleMods: But why this simple option is  not available? Why the hassles?
[2019-06-02 23:51:49] <MadLittleMods> parthi2929: Not implemented yet. You can track,gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1162
gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1990
[2019-06-03 17:55:59] <pdurbin> How much permission does a GitHub user require to create a Gitter room under the namespace of a GitHub organization? Is "Member" enough?
[2019-06-03 19:13:03] <MadLittleMods> pdurbin: Member is enough to create or admin a room based on a GitHub org/repo
[2019-06-03 19:14:02] <pdurbin> Interesting. Have you gotten complaints from people who are "Owner" of a GitHub org about this? That you're making it too easy for non-owners to create rooms?
[2019-06-03 19:22:46] <MadLittleMods> pdurbin: I'd say more that non-owners can delete a room, [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-06-03 19:23:13] <pdurbin> !
[2019-06-03 19:24:37] <pdurbin> wow
[2019-06-03 20:45:50] <pdurbin> Thanks.
[2019-06-03 22:52:44] <neilathomson> I updated my profile pic on gitlab and I see the updated image in the chat pane (the updated one has a purple background) but in the top right (account section) I see the old image still (the old one has an orange background). Has gitter cached the old image? Will it ever update? It's really bugging me. Also when I click my pic in the chat pane, the popup has the old image in it. Anyone else seeing this for me?
[2019-06-03 23:08:11] <neilathomson> Where I said gitlab I meant github
[2019-06-04 00:32:43] <MadLittleMods> @neilathomson In case you haven't tried already, see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/accounts.md#how-do-i-update-my-avatarI see your new avatar
[2019-06-04 10:41:51] <neilathomson> MadLittleMods:  [<-LINK->] This is what I see, I have tried logging out logging in, deleting and recreating account etc...
[2019-06-04 10:43:50] <cbj4074> FWIW, I see your other avatar,@neilathomson:)
[2019-06-04 10:44:05] <neilathomson> It has changed since yesterday however, profile image in the top right of Gitter is now showing the new profile pic, yesterday it showed the old one
[2019-06-04 10:44:41] <neilathomson> cbj4074: do you see the purple-ish profile pic?
[2019-06-04 10:44:59] <cbj4074> neilathomson: Yep! Looks great!
[2019-06-04 10:45:05] <neilathomson> why thank you ;)
[2019-06-04 10:45:12] <cbj4074> ;)
[2019-06-04 10:46:13] <neilathomson> I recon it must just be a caching issue, I imagine that it will all sort itself out over time
[2019-06-04 10:46:48] <cbj4074> It definitely is, I've seen it many times. It always works itself out within a day or two, in my experience.
[2019-06-04 21:12:19] <nileshtrivedi> Is there a limit on number of rooms created within a community? If yes, what's the limit?
[2019-06-04 21:12:46] <MadLittleMods> nileshtrivedi: There isn't a limit. Just curious, how many are you thinking of creating though? What's the use case?
[2019-06-04 21:13:11] <nileshtrivedi> High 2-digits.
[2019-06-04 21:14:13] <nileshtrivedi> basically, we plan to use one room for each major subject in a college curricula.
[2019-06-04 21:14:44] <MadLittleMods> nileshtrivedi: Go for it 
[2019-06-05 05:00:26] <bradyt> Hmm, matrix bridges are temporarily banned?
[2019-06-05 05:01:16] <MadLittleMods> bradyt: Looks likematrixbotwas banned, just unbanned it
[2019-06-05 05:02:10] <MadLittleMods> People are reporting spam coming throughmatrixbot
[2019-06-05 05:15:38] <bradyt> Very cool. Works. Thank you.
[2019-06-05 05:17:21] <bradyt> Okay, so if I see spam on the channels I visit, I'll try to report to#matrix:matrix.org
[2019-06-05 17:26:37] <LiveTreehq> Very good work guys
[2019-06-06 10:49:32] <Half-Shot> Was about to ask, thanks Eric
[2019-06-06 10:49:39] <Half-Shot> For reference, we're about to deploy anti-spam code
[2019-06-06 10:49:52] <Half-Shot> Half-Shot: was working on that before asking in here
[2019-06-06 10:50:51] <Half-Shot> The gitter bridge is in use in lots of places, so it only takes one person to spam to get the whole thing taken down :(
[2019-06-06 13:59:21] <jareko_gitlab> Hey everyone  I'm the newly dedicated Product Designer for Gitter.  If you want to ping me on UX or design related issues in [<-LINK->] , feel free!@jareko
[2019-06-06 14:08:05] <pdurbin> Hi! UX people are the best! I'm so glad you're here!
[2019-06-06 14:36:57] <jareko_gitlab> pdurbin: Thanks!
[2019-06-06 14:37:37] <pdurbin> Save us! :)
[2019-06-06 14:37:42] <pdurbin> I'm just kidding. Gitter is great.
[2019-06-06 16:23:36] <cbj4074> Awesome, great to see you here@jareko_gitlab. And for the record, you had quite a bit of lively feedback when you first joined-up@pdurbin
[2019-06-06 16:35:14] <pdurbin> Did I? I think the welcome email told me to come in here and say hi so I did. That was a while ago. :)
[2019-06-06 16:40:37] <cbj4074> Hehe, I'm mostly joking, but I do remember you having a few pointed criticisms, if you will. Certainly no harm in that... I had a few myself. After all, that's why we're here to a large extent: to speak truth and improve the product.
[2019-06-06 16:42:37] <cbj4074> Don't get me wrong; your feedback was constructive, well-articulated and equally well-received. Just ribbing you... it's just funny how many people come in here with a flurry of criticisms/suggestions and then become Gitter-Lifers (I count myself among them). Not a bad thing at all.
[2019-06-06 16:42:56] <pdurbin> Well, these days I'm actively promoting Gitter as better than Slack for open source projects because of how much transparency Gitter affords. I finally got around to coining a term for this. SLOPI for Searchable Linkable Open Public Indexed communication. Here's where I mention Gitter: [<-LINK->] 
[2019-06-06 16:44:02] <cbj4074> Absolutely. I feel precisely the same way, but unlike you, I'm not doing anything useful to promote it. I should fix that. I'm going to spend some time with this document. Well done! 
[2019-06-06 16:44:27] <cbj4074> (perhaps I could even contribute something of value to your repository)
[2019-06-06 16:44:47] <pdurbin> Please do! I added a CONTRIBUTING.md :)
[2019-06-06 16:45:18] <cbj4074> A corollary for sure, if not off-topic entirely, but I stumbled upon a Stack Overflow post of yours that had a lot of traction, can't remember what it was about, but I was like, "Hey! I know that guy!"
[2019-06-06 16:45:49] <cbj4074> I felt proud, even! :D
[2019-06-06 16:46:42] <pdurbin> You're in ME? You should come down for our community meeting in a couple weeks: [<-LINK->] :)
[2019-06-06 16:47:25] <cbj4074> I am indeed. Is it on a weekday? 
[2019-06-06 16:48:05] <cbj4074> Ah, Wed-Fri... gonna be tough for me!
[2019-06-06 16:48:43] <pdurbin> Hackathon on Mon-Tue.
[2019-06-06 16:48:59] <pdurbin> But on Tue I'll be at this: [<-LINK->] 
[2019-06-06 16:52:38] <cbj4074> I work full-time, so weekdays are tough, but if I plan in advance, I might be able to catch these events in a future iteration. Looks like just the type of thing I'd be interested in.
[2019-06-06 16:58:06] <pdurbin> Sure, makes sense. I don't make it up to Maine much. Brought the kids to Sunday River over MLK for the first time and had a great time.
[2019-06-06 17:06:57] <cbj4074> There you go! Always fun to hit the slopes. I'm in Portland myself. Lots to do here if you ever do come through!
[2019-06-06 17:09:50] <cbj4074> (especially if you like to eat and drink... although, there's no shortage of either in Boston!)
[2019-06-06 17:11:03] <cbj4074> Speaking of which, I tend to pop into Cambridge Brewing Co. and Blue Dog whenever I'm in that neck of the woods. Big fan of both.
[2019-06-06 17:13:43] <cbj4074> (looks like it's actually called The Friendly Toast now! Nooo!)
[2019-06-06 17:51:39] <pdurbin> Nice, if you're ever at CBC lemme know and I'll bike over.
[2019-06-06 17:57:48] <cbj4074> I will do that@pdurbin!
[2019-06-06 17:59:07] <pdurbin> :)
[2019-06-06 19:42:55] <jareko_gitlab> Where do I update my profile?
[2019-06-06 19:43:37] <MadLittleMods> jareko_gitlab: Your information is pulled from GitLab. If you update something there, just sign out and sign back into Gitter, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-06-06 19:48:52] <jareko_gitlab> MadLittleMods: What are we using from GitLab in our Gitter profile? We have aBioon GitLab, but I'm not seeing that in my Gitter profile. Do we only useFull namefrom the GitLab data?
[2019-06-06 19:50:04] <MadLittleMods> jareko_gitlab: Name, username, and avatar is probably all we use for GitLab/Twitter
[2019-06-06 19:50:38] <jareko_gitlab> MadLittleMods: Gotcha, thanks.
[2019-06-07 12:30:41] <skvithalani> Hello, one more suggestion for gitter feature. The search can be more intuitive if it is provided in the chat room itself. Right now the search gives results from all chat rooms.
[2019-06-07 12:31:56] <pdurbin> You want to be able to search just the chat room you're in?
[2019-06-07 12:32:56] <skvithalani> sometimes yes. As I know there had been discussion about something in a particular chat room that I want to share
[2019-06-07 12:33:46] <pdurbin> Have you checked the issue tracker to see if anyone else has asked for this?
[2019-06-07 12:34:07] <skvithalani> no I haven’t. Let me check.
[2019-06-07 12:34:15] <pdurbin> Thanks.
[2019-06-07 15:43:58] <MadLittleMods> @skvithalani Search only searches in the current room, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/messages.md#searching-messagesYou can track this issue for search across all rooms, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#341
[2019-06-07 17:21:00] <skvithalani> Thanks
[2019-06-10 17:37:50] <Half-Shot> MadLittleMods: Heya, bridge got banned again. I've implemented tighter restrictions and we've banned a spammer.
[2019-06-10 17:38:31] <MadLittleMods> Half-Shot: Unbannedmatrixbot
[2019-06-11 01:05:39] <dawnwinslowrn_twitter> can I hook up my matrix to my laptop?
[2019-06-11 01:06:18] <dawnwinslowrn_twitter> Oops sorry I meant bridge.
[2019-06-11 01:07:32] <MadLittleMods> dawnwinslowrn_twitter: I'm not sure what you mean but this seems like a question more for the Matrix support [<-LINK->] 
[2019-06-11 01:11:08] <dawnwinslowrn_twitter> I have a XYO geomining kit with a bridge.  I want to travel with it.  Does anyone know if I can hook up to my laptop.
[2019-06-11 01:23:51] <MadLittleMods> dawnwinslowrn_twitter: This doesn't sound like a question about Gitter.  For Matrix support, see [<-LINK->] 
[2019-06-11 10:19:17] <Half-Shot> You can ask in matrix-org/bridging too, now that the bridge is up.
[2019-06-11 10:19:38] <Half-Shot> Half-Shot: goes back to spam control
[2019-06-11 12:52:59] <therichaverma> Hey ! I want to work on open source project using python , I am finding someone who has already worked and want to talk with that person ,If there is someone , please contact me . it would be very helpful.
[2019-06-11 12:59:11] <pdurbin> hrichaverma: hi, I'm working on [<-LINK->] and [<-LINK->] if those are of interest. :)
[2019-06-12 06:58:41] <kazssym> It looks the Bitbucket integration is now (temporarily?) broken. Can anybody confirm this?
[2019-06-12 07:00:39] <MadLittleMods> @kazssym Can you create an issue with more details? https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/services/issuesIt looks like the BitBucket integration code is in a private repo . But I could share the code if you wanted to move it to the open source services repo, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-webhooks-handler/tree/2f60696d61748c92d809d39ba7658ceaa177dadb/services/bitbucket
[2019-06-12 07:11:18] <kazssym> MadLittleMods: I cannot determine whether it is a server-side issue or not with my limited knowledge. But I got a server error when I tried to set up a new integration in a chat room after getting authorization from Bitbucket.
[2019-06-12 07:23:13] <MadLittleMods> kazssym: In any case, an issue with some reproduction steps, error message, maybe some screenshots is the way to go, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-06-12 07:24:21] <kazssym> MadLittleMods: I am now failing to reproduce the problem.  I cannot open the integrations window.
[2019-06-12 07:27:35] <kazssym> I will recheck my problem and come back.
[2019-06-12 08:31:26] <schwedenmut_gitlab> MadLittleMods: is it the wanted behavior of the last entry of the activity sidebar list to be hidden after the right-toolbar-footer-region ? Wanted to open an issue but probably this is the expected behaviour so there would be no need for an issue.Hopefully you can clarify.
[2019-06-12 11:59:42] <viktomas> schwedenmut_gitlab: : I wouldn't say that it's the ideal UX, but it was probably deemed good enough for releasing (my assumption) since it hides the oldest item in the list. Feel free to create an issue because it would be better to see all the items in the panel. Workaround of sorts is to zoom the page out usingCtrl+-till you can see all items 
[2019-06-12 12:21:53] <therichaverma> pdurbin: thanks for the offering
[2019-06-12 12:25:43] <pdurbin> sure :)
[2019-06-12 13:39:06] <paris-ci> Hey people of gitter
[2019-06-12 13:39:53] <paris-ci> Just me again, with a quick question, should [<-LINK->] be displaying a 418 (I know about the RFC, but I'm confused)
[2019-06-12 13:41:00] <paris-ci> (I was looking for my settings and can't find them)
[2019-06-12 14:39:07] <schwedenmut_gitlab> viktomas: thanks for the reply. Created an issue right away
[2019-06-12 14:49:41] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @schwedenmut_gitlabIt's probably not exactly intended but you are probably more after [<-ISSUE->] anyway
[2019-06-12 14:50:41] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @paris-ciIt's just a joke message on the user homepage, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-06-12 14:51:34] <MadLittleMods> paris-ci: There is no settings page for account info. Everything is just pulled from GitHub, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-06-12 14:52:05] <paris-ci> @MadLittleModsThanks
[2019-06-14 05:43:33] <esden> Just out of curiosity, mac os app is still officially stuck at 1.177 I am using some inofficial build that@MadLittleModspointed me to. Why don't we have a newer release yet? Also is there a newer build than 4.1.0? As this version despite beingmuchbetter than 1.177 is still fairly glitchy and I was hoping to be able to update.
[2019-06-14 05:48:49] <MadLittleMods> @esden We were holding back because the auto-update process is not very good with the NW.js app. The 1.177 Safari-backed app works okay so nothing has pushed us to make the NW.js version the new default. Some more thoughts here https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/desktop/issues/211#note_68455134 [<-CODE->] 
[2019-06-14 05:49:35] <esden> MadLittleMods: that was true over a year ago no? And I had a ton of issues with 1.177 not updating posts. I hear that from my communities a lot.
[2019-06-14 05:50:15] <esden> I have to keep telling people to use the 4.1.0 that has it's own set of issues.
[2019-06-14 05:50:30] <esden> Like having to double click on the side bar to get to a channel and stuff like that.
[2019-06-14 05:50:49] <esden> But at least one is able to always post with 4.1.0 and receive all messages.
[2019-06-14 05:51:38] <esden> Now one of my channels can't update it's avatar in 4.1.0 what made me look if there is an updated version by any chance and I was very surprised to see that 1.177 is still the offical version.
[2019-06-14 05:52:48] <esden> Anyways, thanks for letting me know@MadLittleMods
[2019-06-14 05:54:12] <MadLittleMods> @esden It's not something I have a lot of visibility on and I use the browser. If we can get the 4.x macOS app signing in place, then I wouldn't have a problem linking it as the default on https://gitter.im/apps. Merge requests welcomeThe desktop apps are just the same webapp in a frame so an update doesn't really solve that type of problem. I see the avatar issue for some rooms too, I'll create an issue now
[2019-06-14 05:56:41] <esden> Not good support of desktop app and cell phone apps is the main complaint my community members have about gitter. I wish it was a higher priority. I was honestly hoping gitter will get better on that front since gitlab got involved. But from where I stand it seems like it got frozen in time. :/
[2019-06-14 05:57:24] <esden> Were you not looking to hire a developer that would work on the cellphone apps?
[2019-06-14 05:57:37] <esden> Those are in the worst shape at the moment.
[2019-06-14 05:59:01] <esden> Or are you just hoping that because it is open source someone will get frustrated enough to start fixing things like that?
[2019-06-14 05:59:50] <esden> (sorry if I sound harsh it is not my intention... I just do not want to end up in a position where I will have to start looking for some alternative, maybe even a closed source one :( )
[2019-06-14 06:00:40] <esden> That is why I was asking you a few times in the past if there is an official task plan and guide forward for the project. You ended pointing me to the bug tracker and commit log every time. :)
[2019-06-14 06:01:32] <MadLittleMods> @esden There is another Gitter developer now but the desktop/mobile apps are not the priority. You can see the roadmap here, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#gitter-webapp. Next big thing is adding threaded discussionsHere is the issue I just created for the avatar loading problem, gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure#6971
[2019-06-14 06:07:46] <esden> Ok thank you. Glad to see a roadmap. Just my 5c adding features like that will not retain users, I have not heard one person that complained that it was missing. The actual main issues I hear people complain about over and over again in miriad of groups I am in is:the quality of the mobile and desktop apps
their stability with poor network connections
lack of a media upload on the mobile appsI hope you can address those as a higher priority thing in the not distant future. :)
[2019-06-14 06:08:22] <esden> This is what I hear when people compare gitter to the major competitors in the space, not the lack of threading in conversations.
[2019-06-14 06:09:04] <esden> That said, I am glad to hear that you are not alone any more. :)
[2019-06-14 06:11:35] <esden> Ohh I see one thing that people complain a ton about in your roadmap: "Improved search UX" very happy to see that on there. :)
[2019-06-14 06:14:40] <esden> Anyways, thank you for all your hard work@MadLittleMods:)
[2019-06-14 06:17:43] <MadLittleMods> esden: The desktop/mobile apps spread us too thin and they get most of the benefits when we update thewebapp. I am hoping the browser PWA stuff gets better and better so we can just opt for that instead of separate desktop/mobile apps [<-LINK->] . Appreciate your insight and explaining your usage
[2019-06-14 06:25:59] <esden> Yeah I hear you, that makes sense. I hope you are right and PWA becomes better. If there was a standard for the protocol like there is for mastodon. You might get third party developers make native apps for you. I don't know if there is something like that besides IRC ;) and that "standard" is missing a lot of things that are needed to fully map the gitter functionality. (yes I know about the irc bridge, I know a lot of people who love that there is one for gitter) And I am here complaining only because I like many things about gitter. Otherwise I would just use something else and move on. So again, thank you for your work and putting up with me. :)
[2019-06-14 06:27:32] <MadLittleMods> @esden There is this issue for Matrix, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1684And there are some 3rd party alternative apps listed on https://gitter.im/apps
[2019-06-14 06:28:59] <esden> Ohh thanks for pointing them out. I somehow blanked on them... I will take a look. :D
[2019-06-14 14:41:44] <marskar> How can I associate an existing gitter community (gitter.im/py4ds) with an existing GitHub organization (github.com/py4ds)?
[2019-06-14 17:51:43] <MadLittleMods> @marskar See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/rooms.md#change-room-security-after-creationI can update it for you now
[2019-06-14 17:57:23] <MadLittleMods> marskar:  [<-LINK->] is now associated with [<-LINK->] 
[2019-06-15 09:47:50] <vhakulinen> Hi, is there any chance to get [<-LINK->] community removed? I just created it and failed to link it to my repo (github.com/vhakulinen/gnvim) and would like to recreate it (the community) properly.
[2019-06-15 11:04:11] <quarkbuddha> is that related to the [<-LINK->] sex cult?
[2019-06-15 12:06:26] <cbj4074> quarkbuddha: 
[2019-06-15 18:01:56] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @vhakulinen [<-LINK->] is now deleted 
[2019-06-15 18:02:19] <vhakulinen> Thanks!
[2019-06-15 23:29:05] <marskar> Nice! Thanks@MadLittleMods! I checked it and py4ds is all set!
[2019-06-16 01:33:35] <marskar> Hi@MadLittleMods, can you also link [<-LINK->] with [<-LINK->] ?
[2019-06-16 01:34:44] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @marskarPlease send an email tosupport@gitter.imwith the same details
[2019-06-16 11:19:50] <pdurbin> Ah, like rOpenSci. Cool.
[2019-06-16 20:48:46] <se5a> Is there any way to get the github webhook thingy to report multiple commits in a single push in the reverse order (so the latest commit message is at the top, not the bottom)
[2019-06-16 22:32:26] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @se5aYes, it looks like we just need to reverse the order here (merge request welcome), [<-LINK->] 
[2019-06-16 22:42:32] <se5a> idk js or hbs, can it even be done in that file? would it have to be done on the array/list of commits that it's doing "each" on?
[2019-06-16 22:46:03] <MadLittleMods> @se5a Create an issue so we can better track this request and info (screenshot with current behavior), https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issuesThe data first comes in here (private project), https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-webhooks-handler/blob/2f60696d61748c92d809d39ba7658ceaa177dadb/services/github/hook_parser.js#L5-34And gets rendered here, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/3c5f9870c74cc0ddf02ad75a578ca2747e7381ba/server/web/prerender-activity-helper.js#L38-77With the template I mentioned before, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/3c5f9870c74cc0ddf02ad75a578ca2747e7381ba/public/js/views/righttoolbar/tmpl/githubPush.hbs#L10
[2019-06-16 23:04:53] <se5a> Done.
[2019-06-17 07:59:42] <MadLittleMods> se5a: Thanks [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-06-17 10:22:30] <taburetkin> hi guys, i am facing with strange scroll issue when switching between roomsas i can see there is no any opened issue about this and i am going to think that this is something specific to my browserthe isssue is :when i switched to the room - comments frame randomly and fast scrolls up and down for a while (1 -2 sec) then stops.this is continues for several days and i am facing with this behavior in chrome Version 75.0.3770.80 (Official Build) (64-bit) for wini've tried to clear cache for gitter but this didn't helps
[2019-06-17 10:45:29] <viktomas> Hey@taburetkin, that doesn't sound like something I know about. What do you mean by"comments frame randomly"? And does it happen for every room? Thanks for letting us know :)
[2019-06-17 10:54:48] <taburetkin> sorry, i don;t know how to explain correctly.
[2019-06-17 10:54:51] <taburetkin> here is an image
[2019-06-17 10:54:57] <taburetkin>  [<-LINK->] 
[2019-06-17 10:56:48] <taburetkin> this happens on every room switch.sometimes pretty fast, possible with only 3 stepssometimes too long - with 5 or even more scroll stepsstep - i mean one up or down scroll
[2019-06-17 11:15:07] <kelraf> Hello everyone I would like to know where .apk file is stored in cordova after one runs cordova build. I cant locate the file
[2019-06-17 14:34:23] <viktomas> taburetkin: that sounds pretty severe. I'm downloading a win10 machine ( [<-LINK->] ) and I'll have a look if I can reproduce the scrolling issue but I assume it's going to be some very rare set of circumstances that leads to the behavior you are observing. I can only think of one more debug method: If it's not too much hustle, could you create one more user with a different provider like twitter or gitlab and see if the behavior is specific to the one user account?
[2019-06-17 14:48:44] <taburetkin> i will try
[2019-06-17 15:40:55] <taburetkin> viktomas: it seems that i only thought that i cleared the cache.just tried chrome private mode with same github login and looks like there is no such issue with multiple scrolls up and down.sometimes switch room does not scrolls to the bottom but i believe its another issue  linked with messages load or something similar.i will look how i can really clean cache
[2019-06-17 15:52:16] <viktomas> taburetkin: sounds like there might be a resolution within reach. assets cache can be cleared withCtrl+Shift+R. The application cache can be cleaned fromDeveloper ToolsinApplication Tab. Let me know how you go
[2019-06-17 16:01:14] <taburetkin> viktomas: i think i've found. the mater was in browser tab. in new tab there is no such issue. so, i think something accumulates during tab lifecycle. maybe some memory leaks or something similar - i'am not a big spec at this
[2019-06-17 16:14:26] <viktomas> taburetkin: I'm glad I could help. If you notice specific steps that will reproduce the bug please create an issue in the Gitterwebappproject [<-LINK->] :slight_smile:
[2019-06-17 16:15:00] <taburetkin> 
[2019-06-17 16:41:36] <MadLittleMods> taburetkin: Something to check is for expanding things like images, attachments. If the chat isn't sticking to the bottom on switch, then expanding things can cause the scroll to pop around a bit
[2019-06-17 16:42:49] <taburetkin> MadLittleMods: Yes, Eric. it seems that this is the source of another issue and this is not annoying. the first one was realy because my gitter tab was online something about a month
[2019-06-18 15:48:19] <nileshtrivedi>  [<-LINK->] 
[2019-06-18 15:49:07] <nileshtrivedi> Gitter messaging is developers-focused which can be off-putting for non-developers. Any plans to change to something more generic?
[2019-06-18 15:49:41] <MadLittleMods> nileshtrivedi: No plans but we did sorta switch to the "home of community" type messaging
[2019-06-18 15:49:42] <nileshtrivedi> I'm referring to "Where developers come to talk." bit in the above shot.
[2019-06-18 15:51:37] <MadLittleMods> @nileshtrivedi Code is here https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/f623bb85a49b9b5458ae2cb914c22840b476b954/public/templates/login.hbs#L24"The home of community" sounds fine to me if you want to update it
[2019-06-18 22:12:07] <mchlsm> Hi everyone. I just downloaded Gitter but it's starting up with my Windows every single reboot. Is there a menu I can navigate to do disable auto-startup?
[2019-06-18 22:18:30] <MadLittleMods> @mchlsm Yes, see the menu in the top-left: Gitter -> Launch on startup,
[2019-06-18 22:20:22] <mchlsm> MadLittleMods: Wow I didn't even see that menu bar. I was using msconfig to disable and it kept coming back. Thank you!
[2019-06-19 07:42:37] <nafg> nileshtrivedi: why would non-developers want to use gitter?
[2019-06-19 14:03:28] <nileshtrivedi> nafg: Because they might like it better than the alternatives? Gitter is open-source, has dark-theme, is free as in beer (perfect for open/public communities), is gonna have threaded messages soon, even has a Matrix bridge (which means multiple choices for mobile apps & clients). What's not to like? :-)
[2019-06-19 14:59:45] <cbj4074> Well said@nileshtrivedi. Community support is a huge use-case.
[2019-06-19 15:00:48] <cbj4074> One could conceivably run a Gardening Club that chats on Gitter... plenty of non-development-related use-cases out there.
[2019-06-19 17:03:01] <bradyt> Matrix seems a better alternative, as you don't need a github, gitlab, twitter account. And even then I can't convince non-developers to use it instead of group text, or what'sapp or fb messenger, etc.
[2019-06-19 17:32:42] <nafg> nileshtrivedi: non-devs don't care about open source. Discord has most of the other points. As for threads, not sure if they have but idk what % of non-devs care about threading vs. devs...
[2019-06-19 17:33:08] <nafg> but to be brutally honest, AFAICT the only reason anyone uses gitter despite it always being terribly buggy is that it is based around github repos
[2019-06-19 17:55:18] <taburetkin> nope. i am using it just to have possibility speak in english on subjects i like
[2019-06-19 18:26:07] <nightlark> We just renamed a github repository (GMLC-TDC/HELICS-src -> GMLC-TDC/HELICS) a few hours ago -- is the gitter room url associated with it going to stay the same, or will it at some point update to reflect the renaming on GitHub?
[2019-06-19 18:27:25] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @nightlarkSee [<-LINK->] 
[2019-06-19 18:29:09] <nightlark> Thanks -- was finding a lot of outdated info (~2014) elsewhere
[2019-06-19 18:29:36] <MadLittleMods> nightlark: Can you link what you were finding? I can try to update it to point at the proper source of truth nowadays
[2019-06-19 18:34:47] <nightlark> Mostly old archived chat from here (a message from 2015 saying that automatic rename logic was in the works), and a comment on this issue: [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-06-19 18:36:44] <MadLittleMods> nightlark: Thanks, linked the docs in the description of that issue
[2019-06-19 18:55:01] <bradyt> the macos dock icon has number of channels with unread messages. can i omit channels from that count without leaving?
[2019-06-19 18:55:36] <bradyt> i don't need to know there's unread messages here, but i'd like to have access to the channel quickly without thinking about searching for it.
[2019-06-19 18:55:54] <bradyt> and similar for other channels, of course
[2019-06-19 18:56:44] <bradyt> Riot has several options for notifications of a channel.
[2019-06-19 18:56:52] <bradyt> Like, mentions only, etc.
[2019-06-19 18:57:33] <MadLittleMods> bradyt: You can set those rooms to "Mute", you will still get notified of mentions [<-LINK->] 
[2019-06-19 18:58:30] <bradyt> Oh derp! Thank you for the save!
[2019-06-19 18:59:30] <bradyt> Perfect, set as default now!
[2019-06-19 18:59:56] <bradyt> Pardon the cliche, "disparaging whining without good googling".
[2019-06-19 19:00:34] <bradyt> I guess I got used to Riot's option being in the hamburger icon on the channel in the channel list.
[2019-06-19 19:01:42] <bradyt> if you extend the nick panel outward, it becomes less clear that the icons at top left are all but one related to the present channel.
[2019-06-19 19:02:04] <bradyt> But I'll defer to UI pros.
[2019-06-19 19:02:18] <bradyt> er, s/top left/top right/
[2019-06-19 19:07:58] <MadLittleMods> bradyt: Your comment was a bit confusing to read but I think I got it. The user/profile menu in the top-right is in the chat room space even though it's more global. Definitely feels like it could be somewhere better and there was discussion at the time but that's where it settled. Issue welcome to discuss more and@jareko_gitlabis probably curious, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-06-19 19:11:30] <nileshtrivedi> nafg: DIscord doesn't feel like a long-term healthy option for anyone starting public communities. It's a VC-funded, start-up. Sooner or later, it's going to have to monetize. There are some users who do understand these issues, even if they aren't developers. GitLab is VC-funded too, but they've got other revenue streams, and have been very good community members so far.
[2019-06-19 19:25:53] <taburetkin> viktomas: i just created a video " what happens when i switch the room in gitter"my previous suggestions was wrong. [<-LINK->] 
[2019-06-19 19:27:04] <MadLittleMods> taburetkin: Thanks for the video showing off the problem. Mind creating an issue so we can track this better? [<-LINK->] 
[2019-06-19 19:27:40] <taburetkin> Eric, i though it something specific to my pc or/and browser
[2019-06-19 19:27:51] <taburetkin> but ok, i will try
[2019-06-19 19:28:49] <MadLittleMods> taburetkin: Include the details of your environment (browser, OS, using desktop app?). It could be specific to you. If you have reproduction steps, please include those
[2019-06-19 19:41:42] <nileshtrivedi> For [<-LINK->] user community, we found Gitter to be the best choice. There's quite a lot of goodness here. For eg: we embed the chat widget on every subject/topic page. Sure, there are things that can be improved but the fundamentals are in place.
[2019-06-19 20:08:06] <taburetkin> MadLittleMods: , done
[2019-06-19 20:17:24] <MadLittleMods> taburetkin: Thanks, [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-06-19 20:18:24] <taburetkin> yes, i noticed that this room is linked with gitlab's issues.suddenly gitlab takes my name instead of nick :-/
[2019-06-19 20:18:55] <bradyt> Hmm, but there is still an unread indicator for this channel in the Dock icon.
[2019-06-19 20:20:09] <bradyt> I'll try mute
[2019-06-19 20:25:13] <bradyt> Ah, that worked.
[2019-06-19 20:25:43] <bradyt> Weird that you can't mix the notifications like that. I want highlight on mention, but I don't want all unreads to show up in Dock icon.
[2019-06-19 20:26:08] <bradyt> 
[2019-06-19 20:28:34] <taburetkin> Something just happened
[2019-06-19 20:29:19] <taburetkin> and now its jumps not so much. i can say almost no jumping
[2019-06-19 20:29:19] <bradyt> Indeed, entropy increased.
[2019-06-19 20:29:28] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @bradyt"Mute" will give you exactly what you describe [<-LINK->] 
[2019-06-19 20:30:28] <bradyt> MadLittleMods: I disagree, Mute prevents notifications from mentions.
[2019-06-19 20:30:31] <taburetkin> on the video you can see its realy annoying and now (i realy did nothing, except the fact that i've opened one gitter in firefox and another one in private tab) and it somehow fixed at the moment
[2019-06-19 20:30:43] <DevAspirerKlaus_gitlab> Hello fellows! I don't know where I could ask it properly, so please forgive my annoyance: I'm new to Gitter. I noticed I can build a project based on my GitHub repos. But I couldn't find how to do that with my GitLab repos. What am I missing?
[2019-06-19 20:31:25] <bradyt> MadLittleMods: In my opinion, there should be a way to get Dock indicator to count mentions, but not unreads.
[2019-06-19 20:32:11] <bradyt> I don't see anything special about mentions when in Mute mode.
[2019-06-19 20:32:23] <taburetkin> MadLittleMods: i think your commit just fixed me. don;t know how it linked but i can not see anything else
[2019-06-19 20:32:38] <MadLittleMods> bradyt: Ahh okay. The dock icon indicator probably just ignores any muted room activity (different from notifications)
[2019-06-19 20:33:19] <bradyt> MadLittleMods: ah, thanks for the highlight, I flipped to another channel before this one and switched apps, it seems I get an OS notification and a Dock counter.
[2019-06-19 20:33:25] <bradyt> MadLittleMods: I was wrong, thank you.
[2019-06-19 20:33:49] <bradyt> But I wonder if making those individually configurable, or anyways clearer of the consequences, would help.
[2019-06-19 20:34:28] <MadLittleMods> @bradyt  gaslightingYou can track gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1993
[2019-06-19 20:35:45] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @DevAspirerKlaus_gitlabGitLab based rooms aren't possible yet. You can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-06-19 20:36:03] <bradyt> Okay, thank you!
[2019-06-19 20:41:02] <bradyt> What a relief, works perfectly now.
[2019-06-19 20:41:22] <bradyt> Thanks again!

[2019-06-20 07:37:07] <cinhtau> cinhtau: I have problems in deleting a room in a private community. I don't see delete room in the menu.
[2019-06-20 07:37:36] <cinhtau> Anybody have an idea how to resolve that?
[2019-06-20 07:38:53] <MadLittleMods> @cinhtau Can you link the room? If it's based off of a GitHub org/repo, you probably need to run through this, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/faq.md#why-isnt-my-github-organisation-or-repos-appearingIf the GitHub org/repo is deleted, then it will orphaned without any admins so you will need to contact support@gitter.im
[2019-06-20 07:47:04] <cinhtau> MadLittleMods: Thank you very much. That helped.
[2019-06-20 19:08:50] <serapath> MadLittleMods: one question - our channelethereum/playseems to not show onirc.gitter.im...do we need to enable anything special to make that work?
[2019-06-20 19:37:28] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] Anyone can help you here so please don't ping me directly for a general question
[2019-06-20 19:44:06] <serapath> thank you. yeah, sorry about that :-) i'll try again then
[2019-06-21 06:11:54] <eric-wieser> Is there an easy way to change the connected github repository for an existing channel?
[2019-06-21 06:12:31] <eric-wieser>  [<-LINK->] has ended up associated with a fork of the github repo it discusses, not the original - which means issue links never work
[2019-06-21 06:12:41] <MadLittleMods> eric-wieser: See [<-LINK->] 
[2019-06-21 06:13:43] <eric-wieser> I am not the owner of the room - do they need to follow those intructions, or does gitter not track owners?
[2019-06-21 06:15:36] <eric-wieser> (and thanks for the link!)
[2019-06-21 06:16:13] <MadLittleMods> @eric-wieser Ideally, a room admin would send us a message and we do check. [<-CODE->] Can you give a link to the new canonical fork?
[2019-06-21 06:16:46] <eric-wieser>  [<-LINK->] is the canonical fork
[2019-06-21 06:18:11] <eric-wieser> Let me know if I should continue this in a private chat
[2019-06-21 06:18:13] <MadLittleMods> Ahh is https://github.com/potentialventures/cocotb  the original?While https://github.com/OrionBytes/cocotb is a fork?
[2019-06-21 06:18:20] <eric-wieser> Bingo
[2019-06-21 06:19:04] <eric-wieser> Some indicating that the room is supportive of this: [<-LINK->] 
[2019-06-21 06:19:11] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] Thanks for the context
[2019-06-21 06:19:35] <eric-wieser> Is there a way to see the full list of admins?
[2019-06-21 06:20:12] <MadLittleMods> eric-wieser: Not for you.chiggsis the only admin since [<-LINK->] is gone
[2019-06-21 06:21:03] <eric-wieser> That's unfortunate, since he delegated most of his maintainership responsibilities toimphil. He's still somewhat reachable though, so will give it a go
[2019-06-21 06:21:21] <MadLittleMods> I guessOrionBytesalso works since it is their fork
[2019-06-21 06:24:11] <eric-wieser> Great, thanks for the help - I'll ping them both
[2019-06-23 12:52:32] <behrangsa> Some dialogs do not showelegantlyon Firefox: [<-LINK->] (text inside drop box is chopped, the drop box grip is too tiny) -- please support Firefox as a first class citizen.
[2019-06-23 13:11:48] <pdurbin> behrangsa: good catch. Is there an open issue about this?
[2019-06-23 15:34:35] <MadLittleMods> @behrangsa Feel free to create an issue, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issuesThe text is a bit clipped off in Chrome as well. I think the grip is just native default and you can click anywhere in the input
[2019-06-24 02:02:32] <febrosy> I haven't heard back yet
[2019-06-24 06:44:23] <joseluu> The "validation failed" message when creating a room is very unclear, it should give hints of what is going wrong and how to correct it, I currently have it trying to create a room in "D6_firmware"
[2019-06-24 12:27:34] <joseluu> joseluu: solved: rooms should not have spaces in their names
[2019-06-24 14:51:43] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @febrosyCan you point to what you are you expecting to hear back about? I can't find a previous message from you
[2019-06-24 14:52:11] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @joseluuYou can track [<-ISSUE->] for better validation failed create room error message
[2019-06-25 23:08:25] <KrissyAD> Hello. I'm very new to Gitter so bear with me. I can't add integrations today into any rooms. When I try, I get a pop up message "Gitter. Something's gone wrong. Sorry". And that is it. I tried in both Chrome and Firefox but no luck. Anyone else?
[2019-06-25 23:11:25] <MadLittleMods> KrissyAD: Yes, it looks like it is giving a 500 server error, mind creating an issue to track the issue? [<-LINK->] 
[2019-06-25 23:21:08] <MadLittleMods> KrissyAD: I created [<-ISSUE->] with the issue (adding more details atm) and will get started on a fix now

[2019-06-25 23:52:35] <MadLittleMods> KrissyAD: Fix is heregitlab-org/gitter/webapp!1451, waiting for the pipeline to be green, then I will roll out a hotfix

[2019-06-26 02:14:32] <MadLittleMods> @KrissyAD Should be good to go now. Fully rolled out to production Thanks again for the report!
[2019-06-26 02:20:52] <KrissyAD> MadLittleMods: - yep all working for me now. Thanks for addressing it so quickly!
[2019-06-26 02:26:41] <MadLittleMods> KrissyAD: Thanks for the follow-up, glad it's working now!

[2019-06-26 14:08:43] <MadLittleMods> @behrangsa I see. Create an issue, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issuesPrevious chat  June 23, 2019 7:52 AM
[2019-06-26 16:06:50] <LemonAndroid> is it supported to embed github gists in chat?
[2019-06-26 18:44:07] <MadLittleMods> LemonAndroid: No, embeds have been removed [<-LINK->] 
[2019-06-26 18:44:39] <LemonAndroid> ok, thanks
[2019-06-27 13:45:56] <behrangsa> MadLittleMods: created it yesterday: [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-06-27 15:06:31] <MadLittleMods> behrangsa: Thanks for creating it, I updated it yesterday and I see you filled in your OS 
[2019-06-27 16:41:09] <MadLittleMods> We've been working on transitioning the left-menu over to a new frontend framework Vue.js and getting rid of the app/chat iframes. All of the usual functionality should be working like room switching, favouriting, unreads, and search. We've removed the communities view as it wasn't being used much from our stats. [<-CODE->] We'd love to have to you try it out a bit and see if it stands up to your use case. If you find any issues, feel free to discuss here and create an issue, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues?label_name%5B%5D=left-menu
[2019-06-27 16:42:30] <wesvetter> I'm guessing that doesn't work in the desktop app?
[2019-06-27 16:49:46] <MadLittleMods> @wesvetter You can turn on Next via the Gitter menu, https://i.imgur.com/LbsunVR.pngFor the feature toggle, you can toggle it in your browser and it should be shared across clients. I just tried the desktop client now and I don't see the Vue left-menu so I am looking into why the feature toggle isn't flowing there
[2019-06-27 16:50:10] <wesvetter> 
[2019-06-27 17:01:02] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] I created an issue to make this smoother in the desktop app, gitlab-org/gitter/desktop#272
[2019-06-27 17:11:16] <wesvetter> window.location = ...opens a new browser window for me, so it's missing the cookie to modify those settings (I get a 304 Not Modified response). And the cookie presumably wouldn't be passed back to the desktop app afterwards anyways. I turned it on via the web and can see it in the web client.
[2019-06-27 17:16:02] <MadLittleMods> wesvetter: Are you on macOS with Gitter1.x? It looks like you can change the console context tocontent-frameand change the location without it popping out to the browser, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-06-27 17:18:37] <wesvetter> that worked 
[2019-06-27 17:19:06] <wesvetter> (and yes, macOS with Gitter1.7)
[2019-06-27 17:19:58] <MadLittleMods> wesvetter: Thanks for trying it out and helping me work out the kinks when using it with the desktop clients!
[2019-06-27 17:20:12] <wesvetter> de nada
[2019-06-28 07:20:03] <nafg> MadLittleMods: good to see some activity :)
[2019-06-28 10:25:28] <kvthm> i get a lot of email notifications on channels i put on only on mentioning
[2019-06-28 14:37:49] <SudharakaP> Hi everyone, do you guys get gitter notification alerts on android. I just installed the gitter app and the notifications seem not to work. :(
[2019-06-28 14:38:31] <SudharakaP> anything I am missing; does anything needs to be enabled on android?
[2019-06-28 15:41:16] <pdurbin> They sometimes work for me. I haven't been able to figure out a pattern.
[2019-06-28 16:45:21] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @kvthmSee [<-LINK->] 
[2019-06-28 16:46:03] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @SudharakaP@pdurbinProbably this issue [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-06-28 16:47:58] <pdurbin> Maybe, but that issue is only a month old. I don't know. Maybe it's fine. I haven't though hard about it. Between the Android app and the desktop app on Mac and Linux, I think I'm getting most notifications. I never use the website.
[2019-06-28 16:51:31] <MadLittleMods> pdurbin: Some docs, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-06-28 16:53:03] <pdurbin> Right. This doc has my favorite line in it: "If you are using the IRC bridge, it will mark every message as read". The IRC bridge is actually what I use the most often. I love it. :)
[2019-06-28 19:11:48] <SudharakaP> pdurbin: ,@MadLittleMods: Thanks for all the comments and especially the links..... 
[2019-06-28 19:12:12] <pdurbin> the links are great
[2019-06-28 19:36:00] <ghost~5d09c182d73408ce4fc3e932> Hm, okay deleted orig messsage; Disregard -- it seems that I just have to remake the org in github then give oauth access.
[2019-06-28 21:25:11] <MadLittleMods> jsgrant: I'm not sure what your original question was but I suspect it was related to this [<-LINK->] 
[2019-06-28 21:29:10] <ghost~5d09c182d73408ce4fc3e932> MadLittleMods: I guess removing original message was unesscary; lol. I majorily restructured my Github account and had some communities that were no-longer tied to any orgs / repos -- and because of this, I was not able to remove them; I ended up just making a temp org on github, then giving it priv and pub oauth access , renaming said org to the given communities and deleting once it reqonized I had access again.
[2019-06-29 16:05:31] <rbellamy> I've tried searching for this via both bing and google, and read the documentation (I think pretty thoroughly), with no luck, so hopefully I'll be forgiven if this is one of those "asked and answered a million times" question - is there a way to see a list of my favorite rooms? Communities are nicely discoverable via their docking on the left menu, but rooms I can't find - and if I've left one of my favorite rooms the only way to find it is to "re-discover" it via search or some other non-intuitive (to me) methodology.
[2019-06-29 21:08:45] <MadLittleMods> @rbellamy What client are you using? Favorite rooms are at the top of the left-menu. How were the rooms lost?
[2019-06-29 21:15:44] <rbellamy> MadLittleMods: ahhhhhhhhh, that explains something. Turns out I cannot leave a favorite'd room. I thought I had more rooms marked favorite, and that I'd left them. I was obviously mistaken. :|
[2019-06-30 23:05:29] <ghost~5d09c182d73408ce4fc3e932> So didn't noticed "deleted" channels are actually just closed ... can I really not remove them and/or rejoin them?
[2019-06-30 23:08:16] <ghost~5d09c182d73408ce4fc3e932> Like I sorta get if it detects activity in the channel and tries to archive them, but had zero interaction on them
[2019-07-01 00:46:21] <MadLittleMods> ghost: ~5d09c182d73408ce4fc3e932 Deleting a room drops it completely from the database so it doesn't exist. There is no closed state. Can you explain what you are experiencing in a different way? [<-LINK->] 
[2019-07-01 15:46:23] <MadLittleMods>  July 1, 2019 12:00 AM @jsgrant If you aren't in room of that community, it can be a bit weird to find you as an admin. In the past, I have just created a dummy room for people that they can join, create their desired rooms, then delete afterwardsRelated to gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1830 but a bit different
[2019-07-01 17:21:25] <LemonAndroid> i'm having issues where i can't send messages anymore
[2019-07-01 17:21:34] <LemonAndroid> tried with new accounts, stops working after a certain time
[2019-07-01 17:22:20] <LemonAndroid> i'm developing a bot and i'm testing it with the same message a lot like "@botnameshowtree . -L 3". Is it possible, that some sort of spam bot detection blocks my accounts?
[2019-07-01 17:23:39] <LemonAndroid> this is the room, where it happens [<-LINK->] 
[2019-07-01 18:21:20] <MadLittleMods> @LemonAndroid Yes, if you send the same message over and over, you will get caught in the spam detection. What are the bot usernames (I can unban)?Just change up the message a bit. There is an issue to ignore the spam filter for room admins, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1958
[2019-07-01 18:36:48] <LemonAndroid> the bot is sending varying messages, it's my only account that's not banned in fact :D. this account here is the bot account
[2019-07-01 18:37:13] <LemonAndroid> LemonAndroid_twitter: 
[2019-07-01 18:37:35] <LemonAndroid> it would be awesome to be able to disable the spam filter in the rooms i own
[2019-07-01 18:42:12] <MadLittleMods> LemonAndroid: LemonAndroid_twitterhas been unbanned
[2019-07-01 19:47:31] <LemonAndroid> thanks
[2019-07-01 22:28:19] <igalic> i see the related merge requests here are merged, [<-ISSUE->] so, what about the issue itself?
[2019-07-01 22:31:03] <igalic> just gonna sign up for the beta, and hope for the best
[2019-07-02 00:48:24] <MadLittleMods> igalic: Issue is still valid. Dark theme works for the rest but not the chat
[2019-07-02 01:09:58] <MadLittleMods> igalic: To clarify, the related merge requests section just shows any merge request that mentions that issue number. Not necessarily a merge request that solves the issue
[2019-07-03 08:18:09] <pennylanemini_twitter> really stupid question but how do you change your profile info out of interest?
[2019-07-03 09:33:52] <behrangsa> MadLittleMods: any plans to let users react to messages using emojis (similar to some other chatting platforms and GitHub/GitLab issues)?
[2019-07-03 09:36:08] <viktomas> behrangsa: it is on our radar [<-ISSUE->] but currently we are mainly focusing on transitioning the codebase to Vue and on threaded conversations.
[2019-07-03 09:38:01] <viktomas> pennylanemini_twitter: : we take profile info from your OAuth provider (in your case Twitter), if you change your twitter info, it should be enough to sign out and back in to Gitter [<-LINK->] 
[2019-07-03 09:39:22] <behrangsa> viktomas: 
[2019-07-03 10:25:08] <taburetkin> i wonder why there was a dicision to rewrite code and also why its a vue?i heard that gitter was created with backbone marionette (maybe i am wrong here)
[2019-07-03 14:28:21] <LemonAndroid> (+1) for vue and threaded convos as the main focus. really great direction.
[2019-07-03 14:32:16] <viktomas> hrichaverma: : For general developer conversation please use [<-LINK->] . This room is for support of Gitter.im itself.
[2019-07-03 14:40:57] <therichaverma> Okay
[2019-07-03 15:05:57] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @taburetkinYou are correct. Gitter was acquired by GitLab. Here is a blog post on why Vue, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-07-03 15:06:35] <taburetkin> oh! thx
[2019-07-06 10:17:20] <pranshu-aggarwal> Hi Guys, Is there any way to change login method of gitter? Recently I deleted my github account that was linked with my gitter account. And now I cannot access my gitter room.
[2019-07-06 16:41:31] <MadLittleMods> @pranshu-aggarwal No see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/accounts.md#can-i-mergeconnect-my-accounts and you can track https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/400We can update the Gitter room permissions to add your new account as an admin, (same sorta process as this FAQ), https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/faq.md#what-happens-if-i-rename-something-on-github-org-repo
[2019-07-07 07:47:34] <pranshu-aggarwal> Thanks@MadLittleMods
[2019-07-08 17:59:06] <MadLittleMods> We will be rolling out the Vue left-menu to more and more people throughout the week, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#2194If you come across any issues, feel free to come discuss here and make an issue, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues
[2019-07-08 18:24:52] <pdurbin> Will the new menu appear for users of the desktop app or mobile client?
[2019-07-08 18:26:23] <MadLittleMods> @pdurbin https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/2194#i-just-want-to-try-it-now points to some instructions if you want to try it out now [<-CODE->] 
[2019-07-08 18:27:09] <pdurbin> nice! thanks!
[2019-07-10 20:23:32] <MadLittleMods> XtremeGood: This room is for support with Gitter, the chat app itself, not general technical help. You can try asking in [<-LINK->] 
[2019-07-11 18:34:49] <Oldes> How can I remove the left side menu on mobile? There is so little space for the real co tent now! I want back the previous layout!
[2019-07-11 18:35:31] <Oldes> It's so useles now!
[2019-07-11 18:42:10] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] But this option will go away once we roll the new Vue left-menu to everyone, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#2194In future versions of the mobile left-menu, we can make improve by fixing it to the bottom horizontally and have it completely slide-in from the left with swipes. I created an issue to track this: gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#2208
[2019-07-11 18:46:48] <Oldes>  [<-LINK->] 
[2019-07-11 18:46:52] <Oldes> MadLittleMods: honestly... this is so stupid! Look at this screenshot... it's just like 20% of the screen for messages with opened keyboard.
[2019-07-11 18:48:09] <Oldes> I don't want to use an app and although the web app has many usability issues on mobile, I was quite happy with it. Now it is really bad.
[2019-07-11 18:49:46] <MadLittleMods> Oldes: I get it :slight_smile: and want to see it improved as well
[2019-07-11 18:50:19] <MadLittleMods> Oldes: Is this something you would be interested in making a merge request for?
[2019-07-11 18:51:24] <Oldes> At least it is possible to turn the new look off. Thanks.
[2019-07-11 18:54:04] <Oldes> If you are asking me what I don't like on the old one, it is that there is no way how to get some users ID for mentioning. There is only visible a name and If I would not switched to PC, I could not name you from mobile version, because I would not know that you are@MadLittleMods.
[2019-07-11 18:55:03] <MadLittleMods> @Oldes You can track gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1325There is also some relevant code linked there if you want to make that change
[2019-07-13 14:07:12] <IronicallySerious> Hello Gitter!
[2019-07-13 14:07:53] <IronicallySerious> I was wondering if Gitter likes to sponsor developer events like conferences and hackathons
[2019-07-13 14:09:11] <IronicallySerious> We are going to organise one in our college and we would like to get support from Gitter in making the hackathon a massive success :)
[2019-07-13 20:22:17] <MadLittleMods> @IronicallySerious See https://about.gitlab.com/community/sponsorship/cc @rpaik_gitlab
[2019-07-15 06:42:01] <IronicallySerious> Thanks!
[2019-07-15 18:02:59] <eshnil> Do notifications not work on Android app? Some of our users could not make it to our weekly call because of this.
[2019-07-15 18:08:24] <MadLittleMods> eshnil: There are some problems with the Android app notifications. You can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-07-16 16:32:41] <tunnell> Is it possible to rename a room? The scope has evolved and we don’t want to lose the history or have to trade everybody.
[2019-07-16 18:09:18] <viktomas> tunnell: there is a way to rename a room, please have a look at [<-LINK->] :slight_smile:
[2019-07-16 18:20:56] <tunnell> viktomas: Thank you!
[2019-07-17 06:01:05] <ghost~5d2eb0abd73408ce4fc6403e> I forgot, what is the process to reclaim a certain community name? I remade my Gitter account after I did a full-refresh of my GH; And now have lost access to the 'jsgrant' toplevel I was planning to use for my personal projects -- tried google-fooing, but no luck; Sorry if this is obvious
[2019-07-17 06:12:26] <ghost~5d2eb0abd73408ce4fc6403e> Hm, as-per [<-LINK->] it looks like the best way might just email 'support and request an deletion & recreate it manually.
[2019-07-17 06:15:55] <viktomas> jsgrant: that's going to be the easiest solution if the old community doesn't have any rooms/data in it.
[2019-07-17 06:19:40] <ghost~5d2eb0abd73408ce4fc6403e> viktomas: Yeah, I deleted all the rooms (I believe) before I restarted my Gitter account; *Don't know why I thought it would automagically give me perms again to it though -- besides naive oversight on my end
[2019-07-17 06:23:25] <viktomas> jsgrant: The synchronization with GitHub is a little bit tricky, don't worry. Please send an email to thesupport@gitter.im(for easy tracking of the issue) and we'll help you deleting the old community :)
[2019-07-17 06:24:29] <ghost~5d2eb0abd73408ce4fc6403e> Just sent; Thank you so much. :^)
[2019-07-18 05:07:35] <samboneym> I'm using the desktop client on Ubuntu 19.04. If I close the  main window there doesn't appear to be a way to restore it. The notification area icon has sign out and exit options only. If I click the launcher again nothing appears to happen. I did look through the issues in GiHub but couldn't find anything relevant.
[2019-07-18 05:10:10] <MadLittleMods> @samboneym There should be able to restore from the tray icon in the top-bar. If you don't see the tray icon, see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/desktop/#tray-icon-on-ubuntuIt sounds like you can see it though but no rooms are listed. You can try exiting and starting the application again. You may have to clear out your preferences  and sign in again, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/desktop#manually-sign-inauthorize
[2019-07-18 06:57:49] <samboneym> MadLittleMods: Thanks a lot. Turns out I hadn't joined any rooms so the menu didn't display anything. Minor issue I suppose.
[2019-07-20 03:12:42] <bradyt> Why does gitter only sometimes format messages in dart that seem roughly like dart syntax highlighting?
[2019-07-20 03:12:58] <bradyt> Or is it really just guessing, and thinks it's json or something.
[2019-07-20 05:07:10] <MadLittleMods> @bradyt It's guessing, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-markdown-processor/blob/0ee53c3ffbd922015f3ef92580cffd85a88a28b6/lib/process-chat.js#L23-101You can add the language explicitly:```dart
[2019-07-20 05:07:38] <bradyt> Ah, I could have sworn I tried that, maybe I assumed it didn't actually change things.
[2019-07-20 05:08:06] <bradyt>  [<-CODE->] 
[2019-07-20 05:08:19] <bradyt> Thank you!

[2019-07-20 05:10:05] <bradyt> Oops, wrong chan, sorry.
[2019-07-20 18:14:54] <eshnil> Can I construct a URL with query parameters which takes the user to a specific Gitter room with a pre-filled message where they just pressEnterto post it? Twitter calls it Web Intents, FYI: [<-LINK->] 
[2019-07-20 20:17:23] <godenji> What happened to the (unread) notification dot next to gitter rooms? A recent update seems to have removed that useful icon.
[2019-07-20 20:18:06] <godenji> Now there's no way of knowing if a given room has had new activity other than to go visit it.
[2019-07-20 20:35:38] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @eshnilNo, what's the user case? Feel free to create an issue: [<-LINK->] 
[2019-07-20 20:39:26] <MadLittleMods>  July 20, 2019 3:17 PM @godenji Ahhh, the little activity indicator when you have a room set to mute. We have been rolling out a new left-menu made with Vue.js and it looks like we forgot that functionality, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#2194Mind creating an issue track this? I'll tackle it soon, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues
[2019-07-20 20:50:38] <godenji> Ahhh, the little activity indicator when you have a room set to mute. We have been rolling out a new left-menu made with Vue.js and it looks like we forgot that functionalityyes, exactly, gitter becomes far less interesting when you pointlessly click through each room to see what changed, kind of like Reddit, HN, etc. :)
[2019-07-20 20:51:35] <MadLittleMods> godenji: Created an issue and working on it now, [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-07-20 20:52:43] <MadLittleMods> godenji: Thanks for the reporting!
[2019-07-20 20:53:16] <godenji> Yeah, I created an issue for it as well, can close as necessary.
[2019-07-20 21:03:10] <MadLittleMods> godenji: Fix is heregitlab-org/gitter/webapp!1486. The MR will be reviewed on Monday and probably shipped to staging/next. You can switch to next via [<-LINK->] . Thanks again for popping in :)
[2019-07-20 21:31:13] <godenji> No worries, thanks for the quick fix.
[2019-07-22 01:43:09] <bradyt> Can you get a channel to always guess one language, if delimiters do not specify a language?
[2019-07-22 01:43:29] <bradyt> The users on flutter/flutter have a hard enough time understanding how to wrap with ```.
[2019-07-22 01:43:45] <bradyt> Maybe the docs could be made to beeven easier.
[2019-07-22 01:44:10] <bradyt> For example, assume many of them don't speak a lot of english.
[2019-07-22 01:44:14] <MadLittleMods> bradyt: You can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-07-22 01:44:37] <bradyt> Oh, I might have been told that, sorry. Thank you.
[2019-07-23 06:06:04] <bradyt> So I've been asking people to not use the[blah](http://blah)feature because Gitter.app has no tooltip on hover.
[2019-07-23 06:06:21] <bradyt> I'll check if there's an existing issue.
[2019-07-23 06:08:01] <bradyt> Can't tell if this is the same. [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-07-23 06:21:26] <viktomas> bradyt: I don't think that is the issue, I added more info on [<-ISSUE->] so it's clear
[2019-07-23 06:23:53] <bradyt>  [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-07-23 12:13:01] <pedro-w> I've been using gitter in Firefox running under windows and under macos. I am finding that the windows one doesn't open on the last read message whereas macos does. e.g. I am a member of [<-LINK->] and on windows it always starts on 13th July. Any reason why that might be? I've tried deleting all gitter's cookies from Windows Firefox and logging in again.
[2019-07-23 12:13:28] <pedro-w> Looked for issues but not sure what to search for...
[2019-07-23 12:47:04] <viktomas> pedro-w: I'm not able to reproduce the issue (win 10 in virtual box with firefox 68). I know you said that you deleted all cookies, but could you try private tab without any extensions?
[2019-07-23 14:27:22] <pedro-w> viktomas: private tab was OK (but of course I was not logged in)So I tried logging out and back in again in a 'normal' tab and that seems to have fixed itOdd because when I deleted all cookies I also had to log in again but that didn't fix it.Anyway thanks very much, I will let you know if it stops working again.
[2019-07-24 07:07:53] <viktomas> pedro-w: ok, let us know if anything. I'm glad I could help. As a side note, I meant logging in to the private tab without extensions. The private tab has the advantage of not havinganystate from your "normal" tabs, not just cookies, but local storage and other stores as well. :) have a great day
[2019-07-25 07:57:59] <bradyt> Someone is puncutating sentences like this .Despite repeated explanation of how it works .I'm trying to resist asking them if they're trolling .Not sure what to do .
[2019-07-25 07:58:54] <bradyt> When I asked Github to moderate on someone talking about "forced diversity" ,they said they'd monitor the account ,but to ask Gitter moderators to look since they're closer to the issue
[2019-07-25 07:59:31] <bradyt> I suspect they are trolling .Any advice ?
[2019-07-25 08:03:02] <bradyt> I wonder if they're using a right-to-left device or something.
[2019-07-25 08:13:09] <viktomas> Someone is puncutating sentences like this .Despite repeated explanation of how it works .I'm trying to resist asking them if they're trolling .Not sure what to do . [<-CODE->] 
[2019-07-25 08:13:31] <bradyt> Yes, exactly.
[2019-07-25 08:13:56] <nafg> Maybe they have poor coordination. Why does it bother you so much?
[2019-07-25 08:14:11] <bradyt> There's a lot of spelling and grammar issues, but I tried to start somewhere simple, to improve readability of their question.
[2019-07-25 08:14:41] <nafg> Are we discussing how to help people or how to detect trolls?
[2019-07-25 08:14:48] <bradyt> I feel I was pretty patient and kind trying to help them fix it, over repeated messages. The fact they still haven't fixed it seems like a red flag for troll.
[2019-07-25 08:15:13] <nafg> Either that or they don't appreciate your trying to tell them what to do
[2019-07-25 08:15:29] <bradyt> @bradyt yeah .thank you again.I should English more.I wanna read cambridge grammar  basic in use:selfstudy
[2019-07-25 08:16:24] <bradyt> The repeated lack of research in their questionsalreadyseems to indicate trolling.
[2019-07-25 08:17:12] <bradyt> @bradyt oh ok .thanks for learning .you are a nice person
[2019-07-25 08:19:12] <viktomas> bradyt: I don't think there are any plans for Gitter to check grammar in the messages. You can recommend your community to use one of many grammar correcting browser plugins. If you suspect the user having malicous intentions, you can tell them and remove them from the room.
[2019-07-25 08:20:51] <nafg> If you do so be sure to put in the room description "WE DO NOT TOLERATE MALICIOUS USE OF INCORRECT GRAMMAR"
[2019-07-25 08:21:48] <bradyt> I assume I am meant to "lol" there. If so, "lol".
[2019-07-25 08:22:11] <bradyt> (I know, punctuation goes inside quotes, but programming has broken me.)
[2019-07-25 08:22:20] <nafg> I'm trying to use humor to make a point
[2019-07-25 08:22:35] <bradyt> Right, point taken.
[2019-07-25 08:22:35] <nafg> I'm not sure which is worse, trolls or "grammar nazis"
[2019-07-25 08:23:31] <nafg> I would say try to gauge trolling by stronger evidence like what they are trying to convey. Even then, it's really hard.
[2019-07-25 08:23:40] <bradyt> Politely and patiently trying to explain that it's<dot><space>and not<space><dot>is hardly being a hard-ass.
[2019-07-25 08:23:54] <bradyt> Right.
[2019-07-25 08:24:44] <bradyt> I mean, this is after staring at some pretty bad grammar and spelling, not understanding the question, and thinking, "can we at least fix this spacing thing?"
[2019-07-25 08:24:56] <nafg> Two incidents happened not long ago in the scala room, in one case someone was assumed by some to be a troll based on certain behavior, however based on my broader observation of that person I am quite sure they mean well
[2019-07-25 08:25:14] <bradyt> Well, not just not understanding the question, but thinking, "can they show some indication of research in here?"
[2019-07-25 08:26:00] <bradyt>  [<-CODE->] 
[2019-07-25 08:26:09] <nafg> Now some people have "issues," which can include temper, ADHD, weak grasp of English, and so on. Those are problems, but they are quite distinct from trolling
[2019-07-25 08:26:57] <nafg> The other incident was someone that was most likely a troll, however it was a pretty good illustration of what you just said
[2019-07-25 08:27:21] <nafg> I engaged them for a while. Things were kind of going in circles but only broadly, I think
[2019-07-25 08:28:13] <nafg> Eventually the moderator banned the individual. But I'm still not sure -- suppose there's a 1% chance they were not trying to be a troll, is it worth it, and is it right, to ban them?
[2019-07-25 08:29:28] <nafg> One way to look at it is, if I ban someone unnecessarily I'm harming my community, but if I allow trolls or other unpleasant behavior I'm harming my community, so weigh the two in terms of producing the least harm to my community
[2019-07-25 08:29:52] <bradyt> Yeah, the best course of action seems to be, just slowly stop replying to them.
[2019-07-25 08:30:25] <nafg> Personally I think there are values other than "effect on the community"
[2019-07-25 08:31:04] <nafg> That is true, not feeding trolls is usually the safest approach with the best outcome overall. It's orthogonal to my point though.
[2019-07-25 08:33:01] <bradyt> You mean values like, "this accused and banned troll will never forget this moment".
[2019-07-25 08:35:08] <bradyt> The orthogonality is subtle for me. But I don't think you want to spend your time clarifying that.
[2019-07-25 08:35:31] <bradyt> Thanks all, for the ideas.
[2019-07-25 16:02:06] <abhishalya> I just created a new account (as a bot) but it just suddenly lost the ability to post messages, even manually. Any ideas why this is happening?
[2019-07-25 16:03:11] <abhishalya> It can read, etc but just cant post messages...
[2019-07-25 16:05:40] <viktomas> abhishalya: : Is it possible that your bot user was spamming some room?
[2019-07-25 16:06:27] <abhishalya> I created a separate room just to test the messages
[2019-07-25 16:07:41] <viktomas> abhishalya: If a user sends the same message to the same room over and over again, it gets marked as a spammer.
[2019-07-25 16:08:29] <abhishalya> From gitter itself?
[2019-07-25 16:10:21] <viktomas> abhishalya: Yes. If that is the case, please contact Gitter Support [<-LINK->] and we can unblock the user for you
[2019-07-25 16:12:07] <abhishalya> Is this rule new? Since I used to work on bots here, and something like this never happened.Also, can you link me where this thing is mentioned, I don't seem to find it
[2019-07-25 16:21:02] <viktomas> Stating our spam filter rules very publicly would make it easier to avoid them. More in a private message :slight_smile:
[2019-07-25 16:22:01] <abhishalya> Thanks :)
[2019-07-26 02:35:05] <alexander-alzate_gitlab> Hi@MadLittleModsI was traying to create a community based on one of myOrgs but I got the "This address is not available" error, but when I try to get into [<-LINK->] I get 404 error. The org doesn't even appear in the orgs section. I also checked out gitlab-org/ [<-ISSUE->] but there is not any access.
[2019-07-26 02:42:03] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] See this doc for getting your GitHub org listed in the creation process, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/faq.md#why-isnt-my-github-organisation-or-repos-appearing
[2019-07-26 02:45:31] <alexander-alzate_gitlab> MadLittleMods: I've already checked that, also my repos are visible but my orgs don't.
[2019-07-26 02:46:22] <alexander-alzate_gitlab>  [<-LINK->] 
[2019-07-26 02:49:36] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] If you have Gitter private repo access on one, then it should be on the other. The key is to make them match as the docs mention, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/faq.md#why-isnt-my-github-organisation-or-repos-appearing

[2019-07-26 02:57:51] <alexander-alzate_gitlab> It is not supposed to be created automatically by request?
[2019-07-26 02:59:44] <alexander-alzate_gitlab> BTW Third party application access is granted:

[2019-07-26 03:15:05] <MadLittleMods> @alexander-alzate_gitlab Click on each of those applications in your personal settings and then request access for the org
[2019-07-26 03:18:49] <alexander-alzate_gitlab> MadLittleMods: it totally works! thank you so much, it wasn't that clear for me.
[2019-07-26 03:19:25] <MadLittleMods> alexander-alzate_gitlab: If you have suggestions on how to clear up the docs, feel free to create merge request to update them 
[2019-07-26 17:42:30] <bradyt> Does it make sense to wrap logs with "``` text", or maybe there is something with a nice grey so people recognize it's not code more easily?
[2019-07-26 18:41:56] <MadLittleMods> bradyt: There isshell/sh
[2019-07-26 18:43:29] <bradyt> Hmm, I don't think it's grey, and I've a feeling it may try to syntax highlight some elements in logs incorrectly.
[2019-07-26 18:47:29] <bradyt> I guess I'm leveraging this line: [<-LINK->] 
[2019-07-26 18:47:48] <bradyt>  [<-CODE->] 
[2019-07-26 18:48:06] <MadLittleMods> bradyt: If you just want plain grey, thentextis the way to go
[2019-07-26 18:48:56] <bradyt>  [<-CODE->] 
[2019-07-26 18:49:15] <bradyt> Oh, yeah that's too grey anyways.
[2019-07-27 16:11:52] <bradyt> Is there some screencast of someone adding the ``` delimiters? It's getting very tiresome to repeatedly explain to people new to this.
[2019-07-27 16:12:17] <bradyt> Ideally screencast would clarify things like Shift+enter, Cmd+enter, etc.
[2019-07-27 16:12:44] <bradyt> Or maybe something a little more in-depth than the not too tidy explanation of Gitter markdown.
[2019-07-27 16:14:55] <bradyt> The title of the page is RTFM
[2019-07-27 16:15:08] <bradyt> The url is weird.
[2019-07-27 16:15:52] <bradyt> The paragraphs before the table are a bit informal, not to the point. Getting to the point might help when english is not the first language.
[2019-07-27 16:16:16] <bradyt> There's a weird icon before the table.
[2019-07-27 16:17:10] <bradyt> And the similarly attention grabbing comments that follow are visually distracting.
[2019-07-27 16:17:25] <bradyt> It would be nice if there was just a page dedicated to formatting code.

[2019-07-28 05:53:28] <bradyt> Is there an ignore button for individuals?

[2019-07-29 01:40:52] <TommyLike> hey
[2019-07-29 01:49:50] <TommyLike> hey guys, is there any documents on how to self host deploy gitter?
[2019-07-29 01:50:49] <MadLittleMods> TommyLike: Not really. You can track [<-ISSUE->] and get your own dev instance running with these instructions, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-07-29 01:52:15] <TommyLike> MadLittleMods: thanks, that's kind of running a instance for development. r
[2019-07-29 01:54:20] <TommyLike> MadLittleMods: btw, there are some words in wikipedia: [<-LINK->] 
[2019-07-29 01:54:52] <TommyLike> "On March 15, 2017, GitLab announced the acquisition of Gitter. Included in the announcement was the stated intent that Gitter would continue as a standalone project. Additionally, GitLab announced that the code would become open source under an MIT License no later than June 2017.[10] The source code has since been published in a set of repositories on GitLab's own instance of GitLab." Does that mean gitter will not be open sourced in the future?
[2019-07-29 01:56:10] <MadLittleMods> TommyLike: It will stay open source. I am not seeing how you are coming to that conclusion from that paragraph
[2019-07-29 01:57:14] <TommyLike> MadLittleMods: oh, misunderstanding.
[2019-07-29 02:06:17] <TommyLike> MadLittleMods: will the use of gitter.im be controlled by BIS? I found gitlab.inc is a US based company.
[2019-07-29 02:11:21] <MadLittleMods> TommyLike: What is "BIS"?
[2019-07-29 02:12:28] <TommyLike> MadLittleMods:  [<-LINK->] , it's about the entity list
[2019-07-29 03:23:24] <MadLittleMods> @TommyLike If this is a US law sorta thing, then of course GitLab Inc. would follow thoseIf you're curious about something more specific, then that would be easier
[2019-07-29 03:38:46] <kgashok> Has anyone tried https://repl.it/site/docs/classrooms/webhooks - and integrated a gitter room with a repl.it classroom activity?How do I go about testing whether repl.it messaging happens in the first place?
[2019-07-29 03:40:28] <MadLittleMods> kgashok: Does repl.it have a log of webhook requests/payloads? I know services like GitLab show you what it tried to deliver and whether it was successful: [<-LINK->] 
[2019-07-29 03:42:04] <kgashok> I will ask around on their forum..
[2019-07-29 05:10:40] <kgashok> The repl.it webhook request has been tested and it works... [<-LINK->] (10.38am POST)
[2019-07-29 05:11:13] <kgashok> Now, what do I do to integrate this into my gitter room?
[2019-07-29 05:11:58] <MadLittleMods> kgashok: Create a custom Gitter integration and copy the webhook URL to repl.it
[2019-07-29 05:12:18] <kgashok>  [<-LINK->] is the room
[2019-07-29 05:12:38] <bradyt> Who is a mod on flutter/flutter channel?
[2019-07-29 05:13:49] <MadLittleMods> bradyt: Anyone with push access to [<-LINK->] 
[2019-07-29 05:14:18] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->]  [<-LINK->] @kgashokSee [<-LINK->] 
[2019-07-29 05:27:46] <kgashok> MadLittleMods: So, I changed the webhook on repl.it to use [<-LINK->] - but I did not receive any notifications on the gitter room
[2019-07-29 05:28:41] <kgashok> I triggered the same event which got received at [<-LINK->] 
[2019-07-29 05:37:18] <kgashok> MadLittleMods: could repl.it be added as a "standard" service - so it is more easier to integrate? Why doesn't the Custom integration not work with repl.it?
[2019-07-29 05:56:55] <viktomas> @kgashok When creating Custom Gitter Integration, I can see in the instructions:Accepts form or JSON encoded messages to display in the activity feed.message (required): the message that you want to be displayed (in markdown). [<-CODE->] Regarding adding repl.it as "standard" service: We'd welcome a contribution to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/services
[2019-07-29 06:06:40] <kgashok> viktomas: you are right! It is not sendingmessageattribute...
[2019-07-29 06:07:48] <kgashok>  [<-LINK->] 
[2019-07-29 06:08:55] <kgashok> viktomas:  [<-LINK->] seems like a lot of work...Is there some other alternative way / hack to get this operational?
[2019-07-29 06:16:39] <viktomas> kgashok: You could implement and deploy a tiny proxy that will translate the repl.it webhook into a payload that Gitter understands (i.e. addmessageattribute to the payload), but looking at a random example of Gitter integration: [<-LINK->] it seems that hacking together that proxy might be more work than creating a new integration in [<-LINK->] .
[2019-07-29 06:27:03] <kgashok> viktomas: 
[2019-07-29 08:33:48] <kgashok> viktomas: Does this mean I have to host and run a server for handling the repl.it webhooks myself?
[2019-07-29 08:39:32] <viktomas> If you are planning on creating a proxy that translates the repl.it webhook format to payload withmessageattribute, then you'll have to deploy it yourself.  There are more lightweight solutions than spinning up a whole server (various implementation of serverless).
[2019-07-29 09:16:31] <kgashok> 
[2019-07-29 09:16:50] <kgashok> viktomas: I think I will go with creating a new integration.Are there any templates that I can quickly copy and modify?
[2019-07-29 09:20:07] <viktomas> kgashok: the one I linked in [<-LINK->] ( [<-LINK->] ) seems like a good one, it has got test, documentation and examples.
[2019-07-29 09:27:17] <kgashok> viktomas: but I thought you mentioneddockerhubwas  an example for the"proxy" way of doing it? I am a bit confused now...
[2019-07-29 09:33:18] <viktomas> kgashok: Reading my message again, I see how it can be confusing, sorry for that. No, thedockerhubexample is a live code that lives on our servers and can be visible when in theRoom Settings -> Integrations -> Docker Hub. I don't have any example of custom made proxies.
[2019-07-29 09:35:54] <kgashok> Ok, got it. Is therePlayGroundhosted somewhere so I can test the code?
[2019-07-29 09:41:55] <viktomas> You can start it locally (more info in README.md)Start it with node playground/server.js and go to http://localhost:3333 in your browser.
[2019-07-29 22:31:28] <kgashok> viktomas: Thanks for the encouragement. My first webhook hacking! Helpful documentation. Please acceptgitlab-org/gitter/services!104so I can get going!
[2019-07-30 04:06:26] <kgashok> @MadLittleMods thank you for the suggestions. I have push the changes to my repo.I am a bit unfamiliar with the gitlab process.Do I make another merge request?
[2019-07-30 04:29:47] <MadLittleMods> kgashok: It looks like you figured it out. Just push some new commits in the same branch/merge request
[2019-07-30 04:36:14] <kgashok> I already did. Now, you will take over?
[2019-07-30 04:36:41] <MadLittleMods> kgashok: Ye, we will give it another review pass
[2019-07-30 14:02:03] <kgashok> MadLittleMods: - when will this be available, approx?
[2019-07-30 14:06:06] <MadLittleMods> @kgashok Probably in the next release. You can see how often they happen here, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.mdI'll give it another review pass now
[2019-07-30 17:01:58] <kgashok> 
[2019-07-30 17:24:14] <kgashok> Can the message received via a webhook be posted in the main panel (centre) as well? Or is it only confined to the Activity section?
[2019-07-30 18:18:25] <MadLittleMods> kgashok: Only activity section in the right-toolbar
[2019-07-31 12:53:36] <paulbruno> Hey, I originally created mypaulbrunoaccount with GitHub as my sign-in auth... now I'd like to switch that to my GitLab acct. Is there some way to do this? Or if I delete my current acct., can I re-sign up and get my same username (this one,paulbruno)?
[2019-07-31 16:51:05] <MadLittleMods> @paulbruno There isn't a way to connect/merge accounts, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/accounts.md#can-i-mergeconnect-my-accountsThis will come with multiple identity users which you can track here, https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/400 [<-CODE->] Replied to your ticket
[2019-07-31 17:21:38] <qecelab> Hi, do we have statistics of Gitter Daily or Monthly usage, any blog or article ?
[2019-07-31 17:22:43] <MadLittleMods> qecelab: See [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-07-31 17:23:42] <qecelab> Thanks@MadLittleMods
[2019-07-31 17:25:28] <qecelab> Do we have the latest stats as these are 10 months old
[2019-07-31 17:28:01] <MadLittleMods> qecelab: No. We were using Looker but then had to switch to Periscope and it hasn't been setup.
[2019-07-31 17:29:52] <qecelab> MadLittleMods: do we have a list of all the open source gitter rooms or we have to search them manually by tags in explore page ?
[2019-07-31 17:35:16] <MadLittleMods> @qecelab That list would be huge. You can use the search in the left menu or on the explore pageIf you are after trending/popular, you can track gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#262
[2019-07-31 17:38:22] <qecelab> Can we get this list from API or we get the list of the chatrooms which we have joined?
[2019-07-31 17:39:51] <Richard_Faust_twitter> What's going on?
[2019-07-31 17:41:21] <qecelab> i just wanted to see how big gitter community is
[2019-07-31 17:52:55] <MadLittleMods> qecelab: You can use the API to get a list of all of the rooms you joined, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-08-01 01:27:10] <kgashok> MadLittleMods: I still don't see therepl.itoption in the popup dialog...does it take some time to propagate?
[2019-08-01 01:27:35] <kgashok>  [<-LINK->] 
[2019-08-01 06:31:30] <viktomas> kgashok: therepl.itintegration is visible in the [<-LINK->] (can be turned on by going to [<-LINK->] ). The new version is going to be deployed to production soon.
[2019-08-01 06:49:30] <viktomas> Gitter19.59.0 [<-LINK->] . [<-LINK->] 
[2019-08-01 07:58:50] <kgashok> Got it,@viktomas
[2019-08-01 13:28:01] <victorcoder> Hi, sorry to ask this general question here but I can't find a solution anywhere
[2019-08-01 13:28:16] <victorcoder> How can I change the display name of a community?
[2019-08-01 13:29:09] <victorcoder> I recently created one associated to a GH org and I gave it a wrong name "general", the slug is ok but the display name is wrong
[2019-08-01 13:50:59] <viktomas> victorcoder: Hey, no worries, that's an often asked question :slight_smile:  There is documentation for that: [<-LINK->] -- TLDR; please contact Gitter support
[2019-08-01 14:11:22] <victorcoder> ok, thx!
[2019-08-01 14:27:41] <kgashok> @MadLittleMods There is this security feature (in the form of a secret) that can be used to validate the message is received from the right source.https://repl.it/site/docs/classrooms/webhooks#securitySince I have no control of the server, how to incorporate this feature?
[2019-08-01 14:42:53] <viktomas> kgashok: The URL that receives the webhook (e.g.https://webhooks.gitter.im/e/b8423f4baaaaaaaaaaaa)  is private to administrators of the room. Without being an administrator, you can't know it and hence submit events to it. But to answer your question, there currently isn't a way to validate the repl.it secret, without changing therepl.itimplementation ingitter/services
[2019-08-01 18:41:04] <kgashok> viktomas: In therepl.itimplementation, I need something to compare the "secret" that comes in the webhook message with. Thatsomethingmust be pre-assigned when I manually performed the gitter integration...So how do to this?
[2019-08-01 19:52:19] <MadLittleMods> @kgashok It isn't possible to define a secret when you setup an integration. [<-CODE->] Here is the relevant code [<-CODE->] Private project: [<-CODE->] 
[2019-08-01 22:34:59] <kellytk> Where should I link authors of repos to to learn how to enable a Gitter channel for their repos?
[2019-08-01 22:46:16] <MadLittleMods> kellytk: There are some docs on community and room creationhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/communities.md#community-creation
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/rooms.md#room-creation
[2019-08-01 22:52:08] <kellytk> MadLittleMods: Excellent thank you.  I'd suggest adding those links in close proximity to the "CREATE YOUR OWN COMMUNITY" button at [<-LINK->] .  In the subsequent page/modal ideally, before any auth is prompted for
[2019-08-01 22:54:59] <MadLittleMods> @kellytk Here is the relevant homepage code if you're interested in adding it, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/daf359ef329288b36e40b37638f80faa1adb223e/public/templates/homepage.hbs#L54Maybe just a simple "Read more" link under the button, https://gitter.im/?redirect=no
[2019-08-01 23:13:00] <kellytk> MadLittleMods: Do you prefer patches be from thedevelopbranch?
[2019-08-01 23:53:25] <kellytk> kellytk/webapp@605a539is my attempt.  The build failed.  I don't have the capacity to take it any further.  Do what you wish with it and I'll circle back on the fork in a few months and delete it
[2019-08-01 23:59:09] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] Can you create a merge request from your branch to the main project?
[2019-08-02 00:03:21] <kellytk> Sure
[2019-08-02 00:07:17] <kellytk> madlittlemods: Done
[2019-08-02 00:36:06] <MadLittleMods> kellytk: Thanks, I gave it a review pass,gitlab-org/gitter/webapp!1549
[2019-08-02 03:05:50] <kellytk> I'm sorry, I have no additional capacity.  All the best
[2019-08-02 03:06:40] <MadLittleMods> kellytk: Okay, I can merge my MR with the additions. Thanks for taking a stab at it!
[2019-08-02 04:20:47] <kgashok> MadLittleMods: The links you've provided above  don't work. Please send the right links.
[2019-08-02 04:21:27] <MadLittleMods> @kgashok As mentioned in  August 1, 2019 2:52 PM, it's a private project so it will 404Once you create the issue with the plan, we will have to implement the changes
[2019-08-02 09:08:48] <kgashok> MadLittleMods: - got it!
[2019-08-02 09:29:51] <kgashok> MadLittleMods: @viktomasDo you know of any web app that consumes repl classroom webhooks and dynamically display data / leaderboard or some kind of end of day analytics?
[2019-08-02 10:06:43] <AdmiralSnyder> anyone know if there is a gitter channel for GitHub-specific questions?
[2019-08-02 10:08:51] <viktomas> AdmiralSnyder: Do you mean questions regarding Gitter integration with GitHub?
[2019-08-02 10:10:03] <viktomas> kgashok: No, I don't. Sorry
[2019-08-02 10:16:25] <AdmiralSnyder> viktomas: nope, so this question might be off topic for this room. i just thought that because gitter is associated with gitlab, and GitHub is a analog platform, maybe this might be known here. (my question really is about the GitHub UI, so quite specific)
[2019-08-02 10:19:43] <AdmiralSnyder> well, actually, the UI thing i have a question about seems to exist in gitlab, also :-)
[2019-08-02 10:21:20] <viktomas> AdmiralSnyder: I'm not aware of a GitHub specific community on Gitter. There is a GitLab community [<-LINK->] :slight_smile:
[2019-08-02 10:21:36] <AdmiralSnyder> thanks
[2019-08-02 13:54:44] <kgashok> MadLittleMods: posted an issue as requested - [<-ISSUE->] . Sorry did not check the guidelines, I hope things are in order.
[2019-08-04 08:03:11] <shashwataggrwal_twitter> Hi, I wanted to contact Gitter regarding a hackathon partnership. Can someone please provide me with the appropriate contact?
[2019-08-04 11:56:08] <viktomas> Hey@shashwataggrwal_twitter, Gitter is a part of GitLab. Please look at the GitLab sponsorship policy here [<-LINK->] 
[2019-08-05 03:17:24] <srnb_gitlab> U+2424 breaks codeblocks
[2019-08-05 03:18:24] <srnb_gitlab> I was trying to put "[U+2424][&gt;][U+2420]" (obviously replacing what's inside[]with what they actually are)
[2019-08-05 04:50:55] <MadLittleMods> @srnb_gitlab What do you mean it breaks them? Seems to look fine to meReference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline#Unicode [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
[2019-08-05 04:51:19] <srnb_gitlab> Yeah, there should be an NL symbol before the greater than
[2019-08-05 04:51:23] <srnb_gitlab> not an actual newline
[2019-08-05 04:51:38] <srnb_gitlab> ``
[2019-08-05 04:51:59] <srnb_gitlab> That should be an inline code with a newline symbol, greater than, and space symbol
[2019-08-05 04:52:31] <srnb_gitlab>  [<-CODE->] 
[2019-08-05 04:52:42] <srnb_gitlab> That should be a block code with a newline symbol instead of a newline
[2019-08-05 04:53:39] <MadLittleMods> srnb_gitlab: Do you know of a platform that handles this correctly? Curious what mono spaced font we should use for this
[2019-08-05 04:53:50] <srnb_gitlab>  [<-CODE->] 
[2019-08-05 04:54:03] <srnb_gitlab> In the wikipedia you linked it says this
[2019-08-05 04:54:17] <srnb_gitlab> I think it's an issue with the character getting replaced by the markdown preprocessor
[2019-08-05 04:54:18] <MadLittleMods> I see it, and it works on it's own
[2019-08-05 04:54:19] <MadLittleMods> 
[2019-08-05 04:54:31] <srnb_gitlab> I'm using Victor Mono
[2019-08-05 04:54:35] <srnb_gitlab> And it's not just a monospace thing
[2019-08-05 04:54:47] <srnb_gitlab>  [<-LINK->] 
[2019-08-05 04:54:52] <srnb_gitlab> Because this gets replaced too
[2019-08-05 04:55:20] <srnb_gitlab> The markdown preprocessor being used wants to replacewith an actual newline inside of code blocks
[2019-08-05 04:55:28] <srnb_gitlab> Oh, it replaced there as well
[2019-08-05 04:55:30] <srnb_gitlab> 
[2019-08-05 04:55:34] <srnb_gitlab> So it works in isolation
[2019-08-05 04:55:35] <MadLittleMods> Ohhhh, markdown processor thing is a good guess. If I just add it to the codeblock manually with devtools, I can see it fine in the font
[2019-08-05 04:56:05] <srnb_gitlab> But whenit's surroundedit becomesan actual newline
[2019-08-05 04:56:07] <srnb_gitlab>  [<-LINK->] 
[2019-08-05 04:56:41] <MadLittleMods> srnb_gitlab: That code lives here if you want to take a look,https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-markdown-processor
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-marked
[2019-08-05 04:58:43] <srnb_gitlab> It's an issue with the base, markedjs
[2019-08-05 04:59:04] <srnb_gitlab> (Try out the demo)[ [<-LINK->] ]
[2019-08-05 04:59:13] <srnb_gitlab> Ok.
[2019-08-05 04:59:21] <srnb_gitlab> You know what I mean, put U+2424 in the demo
[2019-08-05 04:59:26] <srnb_gitlab> It'll become a newline
[2019-08-05 05:01:49] <srnb_gitlab>  [<-LINK->] 
[2019-08-05 05:01:50] <srnb_gitlab> Yeah
[2019-08-05 05:01:53] <srnb_gitlab> there's a working link
[2019-08-05 05:02:48] <MadLittleMods> @srnb_gitlab It would be good to switch to something CommonMark in the future.Mind creating an issue? https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues?label_name[]=text-formatting
[2019-08-05 05:03:08] <srnb_gitlab> Sure, I'll finish this issue on Marked though.
[2019-08-05 05:04:10] <srnb_gitlab>  [<-ISSUE->] Got this done
[2019-08-05 05:06:20] <srnb_gitlab> MadLittleMods:  [<-ISSUE->] very barebones, I'm fairly certain as an admin you can edit it if you'd like
[2019-08-05 05:06:28] <srnb_gitlab> I have to go now though 
[2019-08-05 05:29:34] <MadLittleMods> Thanks@srnb_gitlab:)
[2019-08-05 09:57:16] <kellytk> May I ask why [<-LINK->] provides an option to sign in with GitHub but not GitLab?
[2019-08-05 10:03:42] <viktomas> kellytk: that's going to be the configuration of the GitLabinstancerunning on URL [<-LINK->] any questions around the instance configuration should be pointed towards its maintainers. If you've got GitLab related questions, please use [<-LINK->] this room is for Gitter related discussion. Hope that helped :slight_smile:
[2019-08-05 10:04:18] <kellytk> Yes, thank you
[2019-08-06 16:13:44] <egil> Hi all
[2019-08-06 16:14:01] <egil> is it possible rename a gitter room/community?
[2019-08-06 16:15:08] <egil> I would like to rename [<-LINK->] to just [<-LINK->] (notice the added 's' in components).
[2019-08-06 17:13:37] <MadLittleMods> @egil https://gitter.im/razor-components-testing-library/home is setup and ready to go Here are the docs, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/communities.md#rename-a-community
[2019-08-06 17:45:21] <egil> MadLittleMods: thanks.
[2019-08-07 14:17:46] <HenkPoley> Could somebody ban@CoolBeautywho is apparently identity scamming people "for Upwork" on the laravel/laravel channel ? (at least being spam-ish about Upwork)
[2019-08-07 14:47:43] <viktomas> HenkPoley: I see what you mean but that would be something for thelaravel/laraveladmins to decide/do.
[2019-08-07 14:48:41] <HenkPoley> You expect this user to not do the same elsewhere ? There's also mention of direct private messaging in previous days.
[2019-08-07 14:49:39] <HenkPoley> E.g.@UncertaintyPMmentioning "I guess, already got a dm from it some days ago"
[2019-08-07 14:49:59] <HenkPoley> Not ..PM but ..P
[2019-08-07 15:19:21] <viktomas> HenkPoley: :@CoolBeautyhas been banned for spamming after further investigation.
[2019-08-07 16:01:34] <cbj4074> 
[2019-08-08 07:45:59] <HenkPoley> viktomas: thanks :)
[2019-08-09 07:23:21] <Half-Shot> MadLittleMods: Gitter matrix bridge appears to be banned again, can@MatrixBotbe unbanned?
[2019-08-09 10:09:02] <viktomas> Half-Shot: Done, I remember there was a discussion around this issue weeks ago, has there been any resolution?
[2019-08-09 14:20:26] <Half-Shot> We deployed some ban prevention code by dropping spammy looking messages, but it's difficult to tell how effective it's going to be until someone manages to beat it. I guess there isn't some sort of application process for whitelisting us from the ban system?
[2019-08-09 14:22:31] <Half-Shot> (for ref, our anti-ban code looks like [<-LINK->] )
[2019-08-09 16:05:22] <cortinico> Hi all, I'd love to report a user for spam (posting random job offering in a public channel). Apparently the "Report" option on the message contextual menu does nothing. I googled and I wasn't able to find specific documentation on this (other than coming to gitterHQ/gitter for support).
[2019-08-09 16:21:26] <viktomas> Half-Shot: Thanks for the reference. I think that@MatrixBotis not going to get banned for sending duplicate messages because the spam detection [<-LINK->] . I think more likely people "Report" messages from the bot using the context menu on a message ( [<-CODE->] )
[2019-08-09 16:26:43] <viktomas> cortinico: The room admins can ban any user from the room. The "Report" option needs multiple people to mark the message for the "offending" user to be banned. If you have a reason to believe the user spams other rooms/users, please contactsupport@gitter.imand we'll have a look into it.
[2019-08-09 16:28:01] <Half-Shot> Thanks for the info@viktomas, I suppose there's no way around this (either reporting issues to the Matrix staff directly and giving us some kind of exemption). The problem is occasionally users will join via the bridge, and the reports will end up banning the bridge user rather than the spammer which opens up a pretty nasty abuse vector.
[2019-08-09 17:32:03] <cortinico> Thanks for the hints@viktomas
[2019-08-10 01:20:32] <Half-Shot> viktomas: sorry to pester, but any thoughts for a exemption for the bridge?
[2019-08-10 16:53:33] <MadLittleMods> @Half-Shot Create an issue to discuss and track this better, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issuesThere is  gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1958
[2019-08-12 09:14:26] <Half-Shot> Have filed [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-08-17 15:10:46] <gitleet> Curious, has gitter had to increase its server footprint since joining gitlab?
[2019-08-19 01:01:19] <MadLittleMods> gitleet: No, we have been using 8 mainwebappand websocket servers for a while now ( [<-LINK->] ). In the distant past with outages and some servers going down, we spun up more servers to account for traffic shifting over to the few new ones and decided to keep them to keep things smooth which has worked well for resiliency of the system overall
[2019-08-19 01:34:41] <eliotb_gitlab> How do I see rooms associated with gitlab.com accounts?
[2019-08-19 01:35:44] <eliotb_gitlab> I am logged in with gitlab.com identity, and don't see rooms I subscribed to with my github.com identity, so something is different...
[2019-08-19 01:39:19] <eliotb_gitlab> I guess the meta issue is that the UI is so streamlined or "intuitive" that it is opaque if I don't have the right intuitions...
[2019-08-19 01:45:20] <rostrander_gitlab> eliotb_gitlab: IIRC, the issue is that your gitlab and github identity are treated as two entirely separate accounts, so you won't see the subscriptions you made on one if you're on the other.
[2019-08-19 02:28:23] <MadLittleMods> eliotb_gitlab: What@rostrander_gitlabsaid is correct ^. They are two separate accounts and can't be merged, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-08-19 02:51:43] <eliotb_gitlab> MadLittleMods: thanks makes sense.  Still not clear on my initial Q. I'm logged in with gitlab, but when I search for my gitlab username (eliotb)  in the LHS sidebar, i'm shown my github repositories.  If I search for eliotb_gitlab, I see no repositories.
[2019-08-19 02:52:16] <eliotb_gitlab> And in this whole UI I see no "Help"
[2019-08-19 02:56:35] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
[2019-08-19 02:58:05] <MadLittleMods> @eliotb_gitlab We could add a "Help (docs)" menu item entry to the profile menu dropdown. Mind creating an issue and I can link some relevant code if you are interested in contributing the update, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues
[2019-08-19 03:10:48] <eliotb_gitlab> MadLittleMods: I'm going away to think and read...
[2019-08-19 03:12:15] <eliotb_gitlab> AFAICS "Home" is the closest existing place to Help.  Followed by home/learn,  then [<-LINK->] 
[2019-08-19 03:44:06] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] We can still make getting to the docs easier (create an issue so we can track it), https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues
[2019-08-19 05:38:36] <eliotb_gitlab> Created [<-ISSUE->] to improve help discovery
[2019-08-19 05:42:19] <MadLittleMods> Thanks@eliotb_gitlab, added some relevant code links to the issue if you want to create a merge request
[2019-08-19 05:42:54] <eliotb_gitlab> Aside: should I create another issue for "Mention button on issue popup for gitter issue creates incorrect link"
[2019-08-19 05:43:37] <eliotb_gitlab> I.e. mouse hover over there in the RHS bar pops up correct info from gitter issue, but the Mention button results in a link that points to github
[2019-08-19 05:47:45] <MadLittleMods> @eliotb_gitlab  Issue would be good and we could conditionally show that button based on the provider(GitLab/GitHub). That short issue syntax would work once gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1445 is in placeThe relevant code is here,https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/e219d94fb1986444275fe9a92f5884b93578977b/public/js/views/chat/decorators/commitDecorator.js#L77-81

[2019-08-19 05:56:14] <eliotb_gitlab> MadLittleMods: issue [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-08-19 05:59:58] <MadLittleMods> Thanks@eliotb_gitlab
[2019-08-19 22:52:07] <shlomiassaf>  [<-CODE->] The project is not privateThe project was private, but now it's publicI have both public and private repo access apps in my github account.I suspect it's a cache in gitter for that repo, any help is appreciated.
[2019-08-20 01:38:23] <MadLittleMods> @shlomiassaf See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/faq.md#why-isnt-my-github-organisation-or-repos-appearingDo you have public/private OAuth scopes granted on the GitHub org as well?Can you link the repo?
[2019-08-20 06:58:10] <batzen> Hi there. The mobile Website seems to be broken. The button which should open the list of rooms/conversations is missing. At least on chrome and edge. Haven't tested more browsers.
[2019-08-20 06:59:15] <MadLittleMods> @batzen To open the left-menu on mobile, just swipe anywhere from the leftI'm curious, which button were you trying to push to open the menu? There is some discussion here, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#2225
[2019-08-20 06:59:51] <batzen> There was a menu button in the upper left corner before.
[2019-08-20 07:01:49] <MadLittleMods> batzen: Thanks for the info! I think we will end up adding a hamburger button there, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-08-20 07:09:24] <batzen> Now that i know i have to swipe I don't need a button. The main issue with this change is that you have to know it and it's not really obvious. Don't know how you could make it more obvious.
[2019-08-20 15:31:29] <gitleet> MadLittleMods: Cool thanks.  Just curious.  Any stats on how many active websockets open? msg per second etc?
[2019-08-20 15:41:58] <MadLittleMods> @gitleet Here are some graphs from Datadog [<-CODE->] 
[2019-08-20 17:10:41] <MadLittleMods> As a little update, Gitter 20.0.0 rolled out to production. This marks our complete transition to the new Vue.js left-menu and removes the iframe barrier between the app and chat area. This allows us to work from a single codebase for desktop/mobile browsers with a modern JavaScript framework and removes the technical debt that was trapped in those areas  [<-CODE->] 
[2019-08-20 17:26:14] <cbj4074> MadLittleMods:  That's fantastic news! Any easy way to "refresh" the desktop app and see the latest?
[2019-08-20 17:35:30] <MadLittleMods> cbj4074: It should refresh itself after a bit for any release. The Vue left-menu has been rolled out 100% for a little while though. This release just officially removes all the old code and the feature toggle itself so the codebase only has the new stuff now
[2019-08-20 18:00:11] <cbj4074> MadLittleMods: Ahh, okay! Does the Vue left-menu have the standard iframey-looking scrollbar? Just not sure how to tell if I'm looking at the Vue implementation or not.
[2019-08-20 18:06:28] <MadLittleMods> cbj4074: Ye, just native browser scrollbars. The big giveaway to me is that it doesn't have any community items on the menu bar, [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-08-20 18:07:23] <cbj4074> MadLittleMods: Indeed! Okay, I'm on the new stuff, then. Thanks for confirming!
[2019-08-20 18:10:17] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] Mind creating a merge request?
[2019-08-20 20:11:13] <cbj4074> MadLittleMods: I don't mind at all. I just tried it in DevTools and it does restore the slicker, slender-style bar
[2019-08-20 21:13:59] <gitleet> MadLittleMods: wow nice! so its vue.js based ok...
[2019-08-21 13:37:48] <cbj4074> MadLittleMods: I created [<-ISSUE->] to track the issue. I'll submit the MR in a sec.
[2019-08-21 13:38:29] <cbj4074> Do you mind confirming that I have the nature of the issue, and the fix, correct before I submit the MR?
[2019-08-21 14:37:28] <cbj4074> Pardon my lack of familiarity with the testing/pipeline process for the project, but I forked and pushed the change to my branch, and it failed for reasons I don't really understand: [<-LINK->] 
[2019-08-21 14:40:50] <viktomas> cbj4074: not a problem, we've got integration tests that are testing integration between Gitter and GitHub and they need [<-LINK->] to be configured in the GitLab CI. But with MR's that don't touch the integration, we don't need you to do the setup :slight_smile:
[2019-08-21 14:41:39] <cbj4074> viktomas: Oh, okay, very good! Should I go ahead and submit that againstdevelop? Looks okay to you? It's about as simple as it gets. :D
[2019-08-21 14:42:25] <viktomas> cbj4074: please go ahead :)
[2019-08-21 14:43:07] <cbj4074> Hehe, okay... just tip-toeing through this the first time.
[2019-08-21 14:45:00] <cbj4074> (never submitted a MR on Gitlab... I'm a Github junkie, although, I am liking Gitlab as I explore)
[2019-08-21 14:45:39] <viktomas>  [<-LINK->] 
[2019-08-21 14:46:05] <viktomas>  thanks@cbj4074for the first contribution 
[2019-08-21 14:46:16] <cbj4074>  
[2019-08-21 14:46:36] <cbj4074> No problem, I appreciate the hand-holding on this first one.
[2019-08-21 14:46:49] <cbj4074> Hope to contribute more in the future.
[2019-08-21 14:57:21] <vshantha> Hi, is there a way to export all messages to excel and have a count of messages that were received in the room?
[2019-08-21 15:05:11] <viktomas> cbj4074: thanks again, your contribution is now in the [<-LINK->] :slight_smile:
[2019-08-21 15:05:59] <cbj4074> viktomas: Fantastic! Thanks a lot for the support and encouragement; sure makes contributing a worthwhile endeavor! (Not at all the case in every project!)
[2019-08-21 15:10:26] <viktomas> vshantha: There is not an out of the box solution, there is [<-LINK->] and even though it doesn't allow you to fetch all the messages at once (to protect the peformance of our DB), you can fetch all messages in batches.
[2019-08-25 19:17:45] <Oldes> Why the hell I cannot see lust of all chets in web mobile version as it was before?
[2019-08-25 19:18:29] <Oldes> Lust =listand chets =chats
[2019-08-25 19:19:56] <Oldes> And why in mobile app when I visit chat with new messages it shows the latest one on not the first which was not read yet? It was also working in old plain web version :(
[2019-08-26 18:11:54] <MadLittleMods> Oldes: Perhaps you are running into [<-ISSUE->] . You can swipe from the left anywhere to show the list of rooms on mobile. We always page load the latest but you can tap the unread badge in the top-right to jump to the oldest unread
[2019-08-26 18:58:44] <serapath> hello.i probably asked this before, but I got stuck here:https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/faq.md#why-isnt-my-github-organisation-or-repos-appearingHow can i make my github org appear in the list of organisations so i can add a channel?I actually like to transition an existing channel to a new name including all messages and people currently in that channel
[2019-08-26 20:33:13] <MadLittleMods> serapath: There isn't a way to rename a room in the UI yourself. But you can follow these steps and we can take care of it for you, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-08-26 23:02:42] <serapath> MadLittleMods: thx, i've sent an email.
[2019-09-02 04:31:10] <Hax4us> Can I use compose mode in gitter  app
[2019-09-02 04:33:43] <viktomas> Hax4us: you can in the desktop app. The mobile apps don't support (on purpose) compose mode AFAIK.
[2019-09-02 06:01:31] <Hax4us> viktomas: is there any reason to avoid it in mobile application
[2019-09-02 06:08:19] <viktomas> Hax4us: I assume it was for simplicity reasons. Submitting the messageCtrl+Enterwouldn't be possible on mobile device so there would have to be a UX treatment that would complicate the interface.
[2019-09-03 04:52:54] <404coming> hello everyone
[2019-09-03 05:22:59] <glennmichaelmejias> please add features for long posts to collapse it and just add a button to read more to open the post.
[2019-09-03 05:23:50] <glennmichaelmejias> because there are long posts and it is very long to scroll

[2019-09-03 05:35:03] <bradyt> glennmichaelmejias: You can thumbs up that issue.
[2019-09-04 12:34:23] <moymike> I added a few 'rooms' to Gitter, and I can see I can "leave this room" in the settings.  I added a few 'people', which show up also under 'all conversations'.  When I click the person, it puts me into an empty private chat.  How do I remove them from my 'all conversations'  and 'people'?
[2019-09-04 12:46:23] <cbj4074> moymike: I've often wondered the same. Thanks for bringing this up.
[2019-09-04 18:00:53] <MadLittleMods> moymike: @cbj4074You can only hide a one to one room with another person, "It's not possible to leave a one to one room, only hide it(see below)", [<-LINK->] 
[2019-09-05 10:03:59] <adtor_twitter> Hi, I'd like to make a copyright claim on a file that's uploaded via gitter. How should I proceed?
[2019-09-05 20:15:59] <MadLittleMods> adtor_twitter: Send an email tosupport@gitter.imwith all of necessary info to verify. We can delete the file in question
[2019-09-05 20:17:07] <MadLittleMods> @PramodBisht It looks like you created an issue, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#2271I'll respond to you there
[2019-09-06 13:06:04] <adtor_twitter> MadLittleMods: Thanks!

[2019-09-11 00:29:45] <shlomiassaf> @shlomiassaf See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/faq.md#why-isnt-my-github-organisation-or-repos-appearingDo you have public/private OAuth scopes granted on the GitHub org as well?Can you link the repo?https://github.com/shlomiassaf/ngrid
[2019-09-11 00:30:10] <shlomiassaf> Its not under an ORG and it's not private
[2019-09-11 00:30:21] <shlomiassaf> It was private, now it's not

[2019-09-11 00:33:51] <shlomiassaf> 
[2019-09-11 00:34:05] <MadLittleMods> @shlomiassaf Ahh, you are running into gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1951 [<-CODE->] You will need to adjust the URI so it doesn't conflict
[2019-09-11 00:37:58] <shlomiassaf> MadLittleMods: Yes, you're 100% right
[2019-09-11 08:34:18] <lppedd> Hi guys. Let's say I've seen an interesting message, and I want to "save" it for later, is there a way to do so?
[2019-09-11 08:38:15] <lppedd> I ask because bookmarking every permalink is a bit of a pain
[2019-09-11 08:39:59] <Uthering> Hello  Does gitter support threads?
[2019-09-11 08:59:33] <viktomas> lppedd: No, at the moment there are only permalinks. Would you imagine something like a "star" functionality?
[2019-09-11 09:02:21] <viktomas> Uthering: : threads are coming! :slight_smile: [<-ISSUE->] the early implementation is behind athreaded-conversationsfeature toggle which can be toggled on at [<-LINK->] 
[2019-09-11 09:03:34] <Uthering> viktomas: very nice :)
[2019-09-11 09:06:42] <Uthering> Yep, it looks quite useful
[2019-09-11 09:10:21] <viktomas> There is a bug in threaded messages right nowgitlab-org/gitter/webapp!1591. That means that everyone sees the1 replyindicator but it breaks the site a bit when you click on it with the feature toggle off. The fix is deployed in next/staging and it's going to production soon.
[2019-09-11 09:10:37] <lppedd> viktomas: absolutely! Much like what Telegram or WhatsApp do. It's the most useful thing ever.
[2019-09-11 09:11:07] <lppedd> Having an overview of all the starred messages per channel would be awesome.
[2019-09-11 09:12:16] <viktomas> lppedd: that sounds like a good idea. I haven't been able to find an existing issue for it. Please feel free to create one [<-LINK->] 
[2019-09-11 09:13:34] <lppedd> viktomas: okay, I'll open a new issue. Maybe other users in the chartoom could give their opinions.
[2019-09-11 09:13:55] <lppedd> But anyway, it's a feature I almost look for everywhere.
[2019-09-11 09:18:56] <lppedd> Fantastic, although the text is black and I can't read it hahaha
[2019-09-11 09:19:50] <lppedd> Hope they'll make the right bar resizable, that would make for a better UX.
[2019-09-11 10:59:35] <alehander92> but the text should be black
[2019-09-11 10:59:37] <alehander92> right
[2019-09-11 10:59:40] <alehander92> what is the text for you
[2019-09-11 10:59:43] <alehander92> rtpixally
[2019-09-11 10:59:49] <alehander92> typically*
[2019-09-11 12:11:41] <pdurbin> I love using Gitter as an example of anonymous read access. I just posted a screenshot to [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-09-11 16:29:42] <robertvb> Hi guys, do you know if there is a way to add a message to a git commit from gitter chat? it would be useful for us to keep aligned gitter conversations and git messages.
[2019-09-11 17:46:04] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @lppedd@viktomasYou can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-09-11 17:47:04] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @robertvbYou can add a permalink to the commit description. This will jump you directly to the chat message, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-09-11 17:48:24] <MadLittleMods> lppedd: The text should be black just like the main message feed. Can you share a screenshot of what you seeing? What device/browser are you using?
[2019-09-11 17:49:42] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @pdurbinThanks for the love
[2019-09-11 17:56:33] <robertvb> MadLittleMods: thanks Eric!, but what I wanted is to add my gitter message to a commit at github.com directly from gitter chatroom. Is that possible?
[2019-09-11 18:01:06] <MadLittleMods> @robertvb Ahh, I see. So it would have to be a comment on the commit with a Gitter permalink. This sounds very closely related to https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/402Mind creating an issue about "Add comment to commit when mentioned on Gitter", https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues
[2019-09-11 18:05:56] <robertvb> MadLittleMods: Thanks, I will do so then :) it would be very welcome just to keep aligned github/gitlab comments with gitter conversations
[2019-09-11 18:08:16] <robertvb> and btw, do you know if it is possible to sign up gitter using just an email address? instead of using OAuth with github, gitlab or twitter?
[2019-09-11 18:12:25] <MadLittleMods> robertvb: It's not possible. Only OAuth sign in, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-09-11 18:17:19] <robertvb> ok, here I have uploaded the issue. [<-ISSUE->] .  Thanks Eric
[2019-09-11 18:27:35] <MadLittleMods> Thanks@robertvb:slight_smile:
[2019-09-11 19:14:12] <lppedd> MadLittleMods: here it is

[2019-09-11 19:14:36] <lppedd> MadLittleMods: 
[2019-09-11 19:15:00] <lppedd> The main message textarea is fine
[2019-09-11 19:39:23] <pdurbin> MadLittleMods: you're quite welcome. Keep up the good work!
[2019-09-11 21:22:21] <MadLittleMods> Good catch@lppedd! I created an issue to track this [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-09-12 08:21:15] <egil> Hi gitter folks, are there any plans to do work on the Android client?
[2019-09-12 08:22:27] <egil> And if you are, is there a place where one can contribute with issues and feedback
[2019-09-12 08:26:39] <lppedd> egil: good question. I'd also like to contribute (if my skillset permits it) to the Android client.
[2019-09-12 08:27:04] <lppedd> Mostly because I'm on the phone quite often
[2019-09-12 08:29:15] <egil> Me too. There are clear bugs where new messages doesn't show up unless you kill the app and start it again. It would also be nice to get a notification when you are mentioned if you are subscribed to those.
[2019-09-12 08:30:25] <egil> I would also like to have personal messages grouped somewhere than channels so it's more easy to spot when you get a direct message.
[2019-09-12 09:15:21] <schwedenmut_gitlab> lppedd: and@egilthe repo for the gitter android client [<-LINK->] 
[2019-09-12 09:17:05] <schwedenmut_gitlab> This would be a good place to open issues, fork and create MRs to improve the client.The readme is quite straightforward with its explanation to get set up and ready.
[2019-09-12 09:18:03] <lppedd> schwedenmut_gitlab: thanks!
[2019-09-12 09:21:10] <schwedenmut_gitlab> you are welcome. keep in mind, currently the channel view is realized with a WebView which uses assets from the webapp repository - but you will see in the  README.md.
[2019-09-12 10:40:06] <egil> I figured it was@schwedenmut_gitlab
[2019-09-12 10:56:48] <egil> I was more asking to see if there was any active development going on or planes to create native client or at least one that better integrates with the Android platform?
[2019-09-12 11:47:44] <schwedenmut_gitlab> Oh ok, I see. well if i understand [<-LINK->] right, main focus of the gitter-team lies on the webapp. but from my experience with the android client, they are very happy about bugfixes/improvements from the community side
[2019-09-12 11:51:08] <schwedenmut_gitlab> MadLittleMods: while the right toolbar state (pinned) persists, the left menu is always expanded after reload/revisiting gitter. What is the wanted behaviour?I would expect that the toolbar state persists on both sides.
[2019-09-12 17:23:38] <MadLittleMods> @egil @lppedd There are no plans to work on Android/iOS in the near and pretty far term. It's one of the epics on the roadmap but very far along, https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/gitter/-/epics/6There is even a slight itch to deprecate them because of those bugs you mention, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#2281. If some of the bigger bugs are fixed that you mentioned, then we can leave them alone. Merge requests welcome!The notification issue is probably this, gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-android-app#121
[2019-09-12 17:25:38] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @schwedenmut_gitlabThere is an issue to track persisting the pinned state, [<-ISSUE->] . The relevant code should point you in the right direction if you are interested in making a merge request
[2019-09-12 17:48:45] <egil> MadLittleMods: so focus is on the web app? What about turning that into a proper PWA that uses js notification API etc.?
[2019-09-12 17:58:29] <MadLittleMods> egil: That's the more near term plan  (mentioned in that deprecation issue) -> [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-09-12 18:40:29] <egil> Roger. I'll look forward to that then. Thanks for an otherwise great service!
[2019-09-12 23:15:20] <pdurbin> MadLittleMods: please don't deprecate the Android app! I use it all the time!
[2019-09-12 23:32:05] <MadLittleMods> pdurbin: We don't want to stop existing users from using it
[2019-09-12 23:48:05] <janicez> use it through IRC if you want an android app
[2019-09-13 00:41:18] <pdurbin> Hmm. Not a bad point. I'm typing this through weechat and the Gitter IRC gateway. But the nice thing that the Android app gives you is history/scrollback. IRC doesn't.
[2019-09-13 07:34:27] <schwedenmut_gitlab>  [<-LINK->] @MadLittleModsI will take a look at the issue - thanks for pointing into the correct direction
[2019-09-14 08:07:22] <artindk> How do I connect Thunderbird with Gitter. I have followed the instructions on irc.gitter.im but he is giving the error You must authenticate, check: [<-LINK->] .
[2019-09-14 09:57:00] <schwedenmut_gitlab> Just out of curiosity I just downloaded Thunderbird and checked - I ran into the same error while everything works with Textual (as example application).Probably something with Thunderbirds' IRC implementation ?
[2019-09-14 10:09:22] <schwedenmut_gitlab>  [<-LINK->] @artindktake a look at [<-LINK->] which explains the server configuration
[2019-09-14 17:41:01] <schwedenmut_gitlab> artindk: die it work?
[2019-09-14 18:56:26] <artindk> schwedenmut_gitlab: I didn't try it. I prefer not to make changes to the config editor, the Gitter website is also fine. But thanks for the help.
[2019-09-16 02:40:19] <ubershmekel> Why doesn't gitter offer google and facebook login?
[2019-09-16 02:41:31] <MadLittleMods> ubershmekel: Just not implemented. Google login is sorta in the codebase but never got finished up and rolled out, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-09-16 04:09:53] <ubershmekel> Gotcha, thanks@MadLittleMods.
[2019-09-16 04:12:58] <ubershmekel> I know it's a minor nit for most. But I didn't deploy gitter because I think a large part of my site wouldn't have gitlab/github/twitter.
[2019-09-20 05:08:42] <vshantha> I have embedded Giiter on our site. It works well for external users but has problems when accessed within internal network/VPN. I get a certificate error while accessing even the Gitter site. Wondering if this is an internal setup problem or is there an ongoing issue with Gitter certificate?
[2019-09-20 05:20:50] <viktomas> vshantha: The embedded version and full version of Gitter are using the same host and the same certificate so it makes sense. I'm not aware of any certificate issues with Gitter. Is Gitter the only site where you observe this behaviour?
[2019-09-20 09:34:31] <kiti-k> Does gitter have a rpm package?
[2019-09-20 09:36:16] <MadLittleMods> AmberSaber: No but there was a little bit of movement around it previously, [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-09-20 17:08:40] <vshantha> viktomas: No we see it only for Gitter
[2019-09-20 17:12:23] <vshantha> viktomas: Exact error message: "Your connection is not privateAttackers might be trying to steal your information from gitter.im (for example, passwords, messages, or credit cards). Learn moreNET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID"
[2019-09-20 17:16:12] <cbj4074> vshantha: It's definitely not the certificate itself, which you can verify easily just by visiting [<-LINK->] and inspecting it. My best guess is that you have some MITM happening on your network, possibly surveillance of your corporate network (by your employer, I mean, not some rogue operator).
[2019-09-20 17:16:33] <cbj4074> i.e., deep-packet inspection against HTTPS-encrypted traffic.
[2019-09-20 17:17:00] <cbj4074> Please show us the certificate that you see. Have to assume it's not this one (or that the chain is different than pictured here):

[2019-09-20 17:38:04] <kiti-k> I used alien to convert the .deb package to the .rpm package and successfully installed it.
[2019-09-20 17:42:04] <MadLittleMods> AmberSaber: Nice! Mind commenting on that issue for others that are curious in the future? [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-09-20 17:46:13] <kiti-k> I am just a rookie.
[2019-09-20 17:48:59] <kiti-k> I used a gitter and I made a good friend.  So I want to install it anyway, in fact many software does not have the .rpm format, only the .deb format.  But a few days ago my system was debian.  It has a problem, so I changed the fedora
[2019-09-20 17:51:05] <kiti-k> I want to chat with him, so I also learned markdown.  Programming brings some positive meaning to my life, so I want to be a programmer.
[2019-09-20 17:51:58] <kiti-k> So tired, I am going to sleep.
[2019-09-20 18:53:31] <sebbu2> AmberSaber, alien can convert between deb and rpm (and possibly a few others as well)
[2019-09-21 08:16:40] <parapenT1sta> Hi. Do you know how to send a Screenshot using Gitter Android App?
[2019-09-21 08:37:01] <kiti-k> I also want to know, generally use md's picture-related syntax, but the path of the file is always difficult to describe
[2019-09-21 08:37:48] <parapenT1sta> Why not create an option "Add picture"?
[2019-09-21 08:40:04] <kiti-k> 
[2019-09-21 11:18:08] <puremourning> I just upgraded to iOS 13 and the gitter app scrolling is not behaving correctly. Known issue?
[2019-09-21 11:18:45] <puremourning> Briefly it doesn’t scroll to the bottom so I can’t see newest posts. It seems to just jump to random point in history.
[2019-09-21 11:19:19] <puremourning> It is worst when the most board
[2019-09-21 11:20:05] <puremourning> sorry: it’s worst when keyboard pops up. It’s a bit better in safari but gitter app Isn’t usable at the moment.
[2019-09-21 11:20:33] <puremourning> when manually scrolling down to the end, it just jumps back.
[2019-09-21 18:59:13] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @parapenT1staYou can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-09-21 19:08:30] <MadLittleMods>  September 21, 2019 6:18 AM @puremourning Not aware of an issue with scroll. Mind creating an issue, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-ios-app/issues. We are thinking of deprecating the apps, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#2281 [<-CODE->] 
[2019-09-21 20:27:53] <puremourning> Sure thing. Will look into it tomorrow. Re the apps, if there is a vote, I would kindly vote to keep them if you have the capacity and inclination. there are serious advantages to the app on iOS E.g. badging and notification settings. I also much prefer the macOS app. I only use the browser when absolutely necessary for things I use often. Think alt-tab/cmd tab as a simple but motivating use case.
[2019-09-21 20:53:52] <parapenT1sta> @MadLittleModsTicket opened 4 years ago? :-
[2019-09-21 21:14:39] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] The desktop apps are fine and plan to keep them around
[2019-09-22 09:37:19] <puremourning> MadLittleMods: thanks. Posted 2 issues. One for web app and one for mobile app though I suspect it’s the same root caus
[2019-09-22 09:37:32] <puremourning>  [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-09-24 10:02:04] <jangid> Is the irc bridge working? I am getting "connection failed" error. server - irc.gitter.im port - 6667 password provided by irc.gitter.im website.
[2019-09-24 10:33:58] <pdurbin> Yep, seems to be working fine. There's even a dedicated channel for it: [<-LINK->] 
[2019-09-24 10:47:50] <jangid> Somehow this isn't working for me. Freenode is working fine. So I am just wondering where is the problem.
[2019-09-24 11:23:21] <old-square-eyes> Whenever I search in Google for a string to look for previous discussion, Google gives me good results, and I click on the link. But the place in the room/thread I land on is not what Google summarised, and a quick scroll / browser page search doesn't return my string.
[2019-09-24 11:28:21] <old-square-eyes> Gitter search is all but unusable too as it returns an awkward all-time list of results in no order of relevance. In the case of code blocks the whole post is squeezed in to the search sidebar, unformatted. So if you're searching for example, an error log you have no hope of finding what you want with any context.
[2019-09-24 11:57:57] <viktomas> @old-square-eyes there are a few open issues for UX improvements to the search panel gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1361 and gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#566As per the Google results, we are unaware of the issue. It is most likely caused by google indexing getting out of date with the latest 50 messages in the room.
[2019-09-24 15:59:19] <MadLittleMods> @old-square-eyes @viktomas I wonder if this related to the archives being relative to your own local date/time@old-square-eyes Mind creating an issue for this? https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues
[2019-09-24 19:32:35] <old-square-eyes> MadLittleMods: thanks will do
[2019-09-24 19:33:18] <old-square-eyes> Also... If you deprecate mobile apps, what will users on the go do?
[2019-09-24 19:33:52] <old-square-eyes> I mainly use mobile apps to chat about dev projects on the go.
[2019-09-24 19:35:23] <old-square-eyes> One of which is a channel about a mobile app I test. Lack of image or screen shot uploading and share context on mobile has driven me crazy at times, as have sync issues.
[2019-09-24 19:35:44] <old-square-eyes> But this seems backwards just getting rid of them.
[2019-09-24 19:38:37] <MadLittleMods> @old-square-eyes We wouldn't remove the mobile apps for existing users (issue for onlookers). There is mobile web as wellYou can track gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-android-app#102 for image upload
[2019-09-24 20:13:39] <old-square-eyes> But the apps will be deprecated so a year's old ticket won't land right?
[2019-09-24 20:43:42] <MadLittleMods> old-square-eyes: It can land from a community contribution (happy to review that)
[2019-09-25 06:11:50] <MadLittleMods> Gitter 20.3.4 deploying to productionYou may run into sign in issues while we roll this outChangelog will be available after we verify everything

[2019-09-25 22:24:06] <old-square-eyes> MadLittleMods: created the Google search link issue [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-09-26 10:00:26] <kdheepak> I just created a community but didn't have the option to make it private
[2019-09-26 10:00:44] <kdheepak> Is that possible or am I missing something?
[2019-09-26 10:03:58] <viktomas> kdheepak: Only rooms within the community can be private. Communities are always public.
[2019-09-26 10:04:12] <kdheepak> Thanks.
[2019-09-27 07:26:32] <pasha-pivo> Hi guys. Is it possible to change mode when typing so that the Enter button makes a new line instead of sending the incomplete message?
[2019-09-27 07:26:50] <pasha-pivo> In mobile app
[2019-09-27 07:34:32] <viktomas> pasha-pivo: the compose mode is available only on desktop
[2019-09-27 09:20:03] <schwedenmut_gitlab> MadLittleMods: is there a reason why the official mac version is the old 1.177 (non opensource based on safari) and not the "current" 4.1.0 wich can be downloaded if path known?
[2019-09-27 09:20:17] <schwedenmut_gitlab> just curious because i am using 4.1.0 ;-)
[2019-09-27 13:28:10] <ericmartinezr> Hye guys, having this issue right now
[2019-09-27 13:28:12] <ericmartinezr>  [<-LINK->] 
[2019-09-27 13:28:17] <ericmartinezr> can't scroll down to see the full msg
[2019-09-27 13:29:04] <ericmartinezr> (it's not always, and when I change from one chat to another it gets fixed)
[2019-09-27 13:31:41] <ericmartinezr> This is how I trigger it: make it work correctly, then change the screen size (I move my window from a screen to another) and the problem shows up. Like I said changing from one chatroom to another fixes the problem, refreshing the window doesn'tw ork
[2019-09-27 16:13:42] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @schwedenmut_gitlabThe reason we were holding off is because the auto-update process on 4.1.0 isn't that great
[2019-09-27 16:14:09] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @ericmartinezrI have seen this a couple times recently as well, mind creating an issue? [<-LINK->] 
[2019-09-27 16:22:43] <MadLittleMods> ericmartinezr: Here is an issue to track the bug, [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-09-27 18:00:16] <ericmartinezr> Thanks, I just saw this message 
[2019-09-28 13:17:16] <puremourning> MadLittleMods: FYI i’m having a go at fixing the iOS app today, regitlab-org/gitter/gitter-ios-app!6-
[2019-09-29 04:59:42] <MadLittleMods> puremourning: Sweet, can't wait to see the merge request (even if WIP)!
[2019-09-29 07:19:13] <puremourning> It’s good news/bad news. I have it all running. I’ve upgraded to swift 5 so can test on latest sim and my devices. But the chat room is just empty. Can’t seem to get the web view to work. Also seems very broken in dark mode. Fun times. I will keep hacking away at it.
[2019-09-29 07:20:48] <puremourning> I’ve also added a couple of instructions to the readme (E.g. need for cocoa pods)
[2019-09-29 16:31:52] <puremourning> MadLittleMods: @viktomasit seems like the ios assets are just broken in latest master in webapp. even if i download the archice from the latest CI build of mobile-asset-build, i just get empty webview. any ideas ? (fwiw i can’t repro any crashes in the app yet)
[2019-09-29 16:32:31] <puremourning>  [<-LINK->] 
[2019-09-29 16:34:09] <puremourning> my bset guess at the moment is that the mobile-native-embedded-chat.js isn’t being included in the webpack
[2019-09-29 16:34:33] <puremourning> but that is what’s best described as an uninformed guess
[2019-09-29 17:02:19] <puremourning> Hahah. I was right!does a dance. I just added that to the webpack config and it now works.
[2019-09-29 17:34:31] <MadLittleMods> @puremourning Better to discuss all of this in https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/contributingGreat sleuthing!
[2019-09-30 18:22:43] <omento_gitlab> Is it possible to alter a community name? Slug I understand not being able to, but the name appears to just be aesthetic.
[2019-09-30 21:02:33] <MadLittleMods> omento_gitlab: See [<-LINK->] 
[2019-09-30 21:07:08] <omento_gitlab> I see, my eyes completely missed that earlier.
[2019-09-30 21:34:56] <johnpankowicz> Is there a video tutorial or manual on getting started with using Gitter?
[2019-10-01 05:43:37] <MadLittleMods> johnpankowicz: No, we just have the docs, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-10-01 07:56:39] <schwedenmut_gitlab>  [<-LINK->] @MadLittleModsok, then I will not go on and update the homebrew cask for gitter to point to 4.1.0. Thanks for the clarification
[2019-10-02 20:49:32] <omento_gitlab> Out of curiosity how many people are on the Gitter team? It seems like a project with a lot of potential, but never really hear anything about it since the GitLab acquisition.
[2019-10-02 21:00:35] <pdurbin> Well, they recently hired someone. So they're growing. :) But my impression is that it's a somewhat small team. I agree that it has a ton of potential. :)
[2019-10-02 21:05:37] <MadLittleMods> @omento_gitlab @pdurbin Just two of us, https://about.gitlab.com/company/team/The roadmap is linked in the readme, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#gitter-webapp. Currently working on threaded conversations but there is a lot we wish we had the bandwidth for
[2019-10-02 21:18:00] <puremourning> word of advice - the most confusing aspect of MS Teams is that in the team page, the conversations are threaded by default
[2019-10-02 21:18:33] <puremourning> this leads to there being N conversations where N is the number of replies before somethiung inevitably says “stop starting new converstaionts, use the reply button"
[2019-10-02 21:19:17] <puremourning> honestly, MS Teams is bewildering, but that one as a UX is terrible. getting threaded convestaions right in real-time chat is a serious challenge :)
[2019-10-02 21:23:36] <MadLittleMods> @puremourning Our first iteration is just a simple indicator with the number of replies below the messageAll of the threaded conversation issues are tracked by this epic, https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/360
[2019-10-02 21:26:27] <puremourning> i always thought that the intuitive way would be that if you@-mentionsomeone at the start of a post, it automatically makes that a “reply” to that person’s last message (which might be part of a thread). I suspect that in practice it’s a billion times more complex (like 2 people @ meting tha same person etc. etc.) but it would be dead nice if the work flow didn’t involve a mouse. just my 2p
[2019-10-02 21:31:35] <puremourning> interesting
[2019-10-02 21:31:43] <puremourning> oh i see, you stick it in a side-bar
[2019-10-02 21:31:57] <puremourning> i think that is a nice idea
[2019-10-02 21:32:12] <puremourning> yeah it works well
[2019-10-03 07:58:48] <Andrzej2_gitlab> Hi. I just found out, that if I made an integration with Gitlab repo, mentioning and issue number with # actually is redirecting me to github instead of gitlab. I cannot find any setting that could fix that. Is there anything like it or it is a known bug (if yes, anyone knows the issue that is tracking this bug)?
[2019-10-03 08:15:41] <MadLittleMods> Andrzej2_gitlab: You can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-10-03 08:40:58] <Andrzej2_gitlab> MadLittleMods: wow...this is a 3 years old issue...so I guess it is going to take a long time. Damn. Thanks anyway.
[2019-10-03 08:47:30] <viktomas> Andrzej2_gitlab: "GitLab based communities/rooms" are next on [<-LINK->] so the wait is not going to be too long. Mind you the dates are slipping a bit since we temporarily shifted our focus on stability (security and bugs).
[2019-10-03 08:49:17] <Andrzej2_gitlab> viktomas: Ok, great. Thanks for quick anwsers. Will be waiting impatiently.
[2019-10-03 18:38:55] <omento_gitlab> MadLittleMods: That is quite the small team, I didn't realize that! Hopefully it expands at some point, Gitter really could be something.
[2019-10-06 13:00:59] <tebeco> hello there
[2019-10-06 13:01:41] <tebeco> wondering if the iOS is still is beta or something ? The number of weird behavior seems out of the usual
[2019-10-06 13:02:09] <tebeco> like the last msg displayed changed if i close / reopen
[2019-10-06 13:02:45] <tebeco> or the fact that the app scrolls back in time like month ago and if i manually go to latest msg it jumps even before
[2019-10-06 13:02:54] <tebeco> or when i just send a msg
[2019-10-06 13:03:29] <tebeco> mot when i type a message but the textbox it self reach the "line wrap" the thread goes black by a month
[2019-10-06 13:03:53] <tebeco> or the fact that trying to edit a msg trigger a validation when i try to insert a new line
[2019-10-06 13:04:54] <tebeco> all that together make it almost impossible to just read conversions on going as the app keeps going to very old msg
[2019-10-06 13:05:32] <tebeco> i'm wondering if the app cache is not corrupted but that would not explain all of these behavior
[2019-10-06 13:06:26] <tebeco> what kind of info can i provide so it can help dev teams to take a look at what's going on ?
[2019-10-06 13:07:06] <tebeco> anyway i can dump the app cache / local logs / diagnostics ?
[2019-10-06 18:56:20] <MadLittleMods> @tebeco Overall there are some thoughts of deprecating the mobile apps, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#2281Feel free to create an issue for each of the bugs I couldn't find an existing issue for, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-ios-app/issuesMissing/order of last message: I can't find an existing iOS issue. There is a related Android one, gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-android-app#2
Scroll jumping back in time (new bug with iOS 13), gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-ios-app#44
Typing a long message jumping the "thread"/(scroll) back: probably related to the bug above ^
Insert a newline when editing a message throws validation error: I can't find an existing iOS issueThere has been some recent work put into fixing up the iOS app from a community member. You can track, gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-ios-app!8
[2019-10-06 19:24:59] <tebeco> regarding deprecating the app ... well
[2019-10-06 19:26:42] <tebeco> i hope you're thinking PWA, installable on the phone because a tab in the browser is just the complete opposite usage of a mobile
[2019-10-06 19:27:05] <tebeco> no notification / hard to track in the middle of other tabs
[2019-10-06 19:29:10] <tebeco> (the desktop app would love shortcut like Ctrl+K in slack to jump through all unread msg fast)
[2019-10-06 19:33:04] <mathpaquette> hello guys, trying to recreate my room using the same name after deletion with no luck. anyone can help?
[2019-10-06 20:15:24] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @tebecoPWA is what we were thinking, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-10-06 20:17:08] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] Here are some related issues but feel free to create a new one with this specific shortcut feature, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issuesgitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1057
gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#241
[2019-10-06 20:18:51] <MadLittleMods>  October 6, 2019 2:33 PM @mathpaquette A community can't be deleted but a room can. If you deleted the only room in the community, the community still exists. You may have trouble finding it in your create room modal, so send an email to support@gitter.im and we can create a dummy room for youHere are the docs for creating a community/room,https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/communities.md#community-creation

[2019-10-06 20:54:42] <tebeco> MadLittleMods: the github link you sent regarding Ctrl+K points to github and is 404 (you're using gitlab now right ?)
[2019-10-06 20:55:02] <tebeco>  [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-10-06 20:56:59] <tebeco> ok gitter ios app is converting it to github issue link
[2019-10-06 20:57:19] <tebeco> that's a hell of a bug ^^
[2019-10-06 21:12:46] <mathpaquette> MadLittleMods: thanks it worked.
[2019-10-06 21:50:22] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @tebecoThis is fixed [<-LINK->] but we need to re-ship the assets again for iOS. The release there is blocked [<-LINK->] but there is some recent movement their from a community member, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-10-07 22:50:52] <ehermes> I'm trying to use the desktop Gitter client on my Linux workstation, but every time I launch it, it asks for permission to access my account, and when I click "allow", I get a 404 error. I'm able to use the web gitter client, and the desktop MacOS client. The system in question is behind a proxy with SSL interception, which I suspect is related, though I don't have to do anything special on my MacOS machine for it to work.
[2019-10-07 23:08:01] <MadLittleMods> @ehermes You might see a 404 after it redirects back to https://gitter.im/login/desktop/callback which does 404 but there is a hook that should pick up that request and store the token and move forward, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/desktop/blob/f9e74fba8bf55b008f7f81557f54d76a48fd9e03/nwapp/lib/login-view.js#L75-109 [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
[2019-10-07 23:08:28] <MadLittleMods> ehermes: If you don't want to do any debugging, you can try to authorize manually, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-10-07 23:11:17] <ehermes> The 404 is for a url that start [<-LINK->] 
[2019-10-07 23:11:33] <ehermes> so, I suspect you are correct
[2019-10-07 23:14:36] <ehermes> Thanks, authorizing manually seems to have worked
[2019-10-08 21:57:05] <irlcatgirl> Will the iPhone app ever get an update for newer screen sizes?
[2019-10-08 21:58:18] <MadLittleMods> @nsuchy You can track gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-ios-app#3We just need to get a new release out gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-ios-app!6 but it has some blockers at the moment. There is some movement from the community to address them though, gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-ios-app!8
[2019-10-09 08:38:23] <puremourning> sorry for the delay, i’ve had man-flu (terminal) this week
[2019-10-09 17:30:28] <MadLittleMods> puremourning: No worries, get well soon
[2019-10-11 12:52:45] <ftab> MadLittleMods: I got the invite to testflight, it's immediately crashing on iPhone XS Max 13.2 beta. Don't know if the data it's sending in the crash report is at all helpful. Tried uninstalling app and reinstalling through testflight, same deal
[2019-10-11 16:22:17] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] Thanks for the heads-up!
[2019-10-12 02:41:46] <eshnil> MadLittleMods: Chrome has this new feature called TrustedWebActivity. It lets your Android app be exactly the same as your mobile Website (which gives you full-fledged browser support instead of a limited Webview, push notifications and all that). Consider switching the Android app to that? I think it will improve the experience with less maintenance on Android. I could help with this if needed. We just need to remove all Java/Kotlin code, make some changes in the Manifest and set up a link between the site and the app (via Asset Links).
[2019-10-12 02:43:32] <eshnil> It's a big architecture decision (going all-in on Web instead of native Android code). We did this for one of our work apps, and have been happy with it so far.
[2019-10-12 07:50:29] <MadLittleMods> @eshnil  This is the plan for the future, see gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1992Feel free to make a comment on the issue with your praise for TrustedWebActivity and experience :slight_smile:
[2019-10-14 20:07:35] <dmitriz> Hi folks, just set up a room and can't see how to integrate with Gitlab repo, any help?
[2019-10-15 06:08:51] <viktomas> dmitriz: You associate the room with a GitHub repo during the room creation [<-LINK->] . Please let us know  if the docs helped
[2019-10-16 10:15:21] <tobbi_gitlab> How do I change my display name in Gitter?
[2019-10-16 10:29:04] <viktomas> tobbi_gitlab: You can change it in GitLab settings [<-LINK->] 
[2019-10-16 10:30:12] <tobbi_gitlab> Ah, okay, thanks.
[2019-10-16 10:30:25] <tobbi_gitlab> It's a shame that the display name can't be different in gitter from the gitlab settings.
[2019-10-16 10:39:55] <viktomas> Just for a reference, you can track [<-ISSUE->] . We are going to be focusing on better GitLab integration in the near future and this might be part of the epic (even though right now it's part of an epic for allowing users to have multiple identity providers).
[2019-10-16 11:09:08] <starlight-tu_gitlab>  [<-LINK->] Is there anyway to get rid the menu? It damages the UI pretty hard.
[2019-10-16 11:12:38] <viktomas> starlight-tu_gitlab: Is that the windows desktop client?
[2019-10-16 11:13:25] <starlight-tu_gitlab> viktomas: Yeah, latest version (4.1.0)
[2019-10-16 11:19:13] <viktomas> starlight-tu_gitlab: currently there isn't a way to hide the menu, you can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-10-16 11:23:59] <starlight-tu_gitlab> viktomas: I see, thanks.
[2019-10-16 18:10:30] <dmitriz> Hi folks
[2019-10-16 18:11:07] <dmitriz> any help with HTML badges to Gitter rooms (instead of Markdown)?
[2019-10-16 18:38:17] <viktomas> dmitriz: you can convert the markdown to HTML for example here [<-LINK->] 
[2019-10-16 19:05:54] <dmitriz> viktomas: Thank you!
[2019-10-17 05:21:46] <starlight-tu_gitlab> Does anyone here use Gitter for Ubuntu/Linux x64?Mine request password everytime open it. Weird :p
[2019-10-17 06:51:25] <starlight-tu_gitlab>  [<-LINK->] 
[2019-10-17 06:51:33] <starlight-tu_gitlab> Today in Linux Ubuntu
[2019-10-17 07:44:43] <viktomas> I'm installing Ubutnu and will try to reproduce@starlight-tu_gitlab. Thanks for reporting the issue.
[2019-10-17 09:16:52] <viktomas> starlight-tu_gitlab: I can't reproduce the error. Can you please create an issue in [<-LINK->] with steps to reproduce?
[2019-10-17 09:43:38] <starlight-tu_gitlab> Sure :D
[2019-10-17 17:00:42] <apobekiaris> gitter desktop does not show, the icon is on the tray and taskbar but the app does not show, i tried reinstall
[2019-10-18 03:28:19] <starlight-tu_gitlab> What does task manager say?@apobekiaris
[2019-10-18 03:30:13] <apobekiaris> starlight-tu_gitlab: apologies it looked some kind of missbehaviour either from windows or the app, meaning that I could finally restore the app by maximizing it, let drop this thanks
[2019-10-18 03:30:45] <starlight-tu_gitlab> ok
[2019-10-18 09:18:07] <starlight-tu_gitlab> Android version seems a bit inconvenience. There is a bug in GUI which I want to share a screenshot but I couldn't because the Gitter lack of btn to do so.
[2019-10-18 09:19:27] <starlight-tu_gitlab> I think I will submit this issue later. But you all agree with me that Gitter needs upload btn and share hook (which allow gitter accept files from other app) right
[2019-10-18 09:29:20] <viktomas> starlight-tu_gitlab: There is an issue for that [<-ISSUE->] but the Gitter team doesn't have the capacity to keep the apps up to date or add new features - [<-ISSUE->] . The latest thinking is to ask in the community if there's anyone interested in forking the mobile apps and taking over.
[2019-10-18 11:26:18] <pdurbin> Some feedback for the Gitter team as a project (Jupyter) considers reasons why they might switch to something else: [<-LINK->] 
[2019-10-18 11:56:54] <viktomas> Thanks@pdurbin. Recently there has been a handful of projects considering moving away from Gitter.  The Gitter team can only hope that the new features we are working on are going to land in time to tip the scales back to Gitter.
[2019-10-18 12:00:54] <pdurbin> Sure. For what it's worth, I'm still considering switchingtoGitter (from IRC). Are there any search features coming? A poor search experience seems to come up a lot.
[2019-10-18 12:09:17] <viktomas> Not in the immediate future. The next big thing after threaded conversations is integration with GitLab and supporting multiple OAuth providers for an account. Those seem to be the most popular issues ( [<-LINK->] ). But I agree the search could use some love. Maybe updating the ElastSearch to begin with (runningv1.4)
[2019-10-18 12:11:29] <pdurbin> Thanks, I'm surprised search improvements don't get more thumbs up.
[2019-10-18 12:14:26] <pdurbin> Only one thumbs up for this issue I opened: [<-ISSUE->] :(
[2019-10-18 12:16:00] <viktomas> The most upvoted search issue [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-10-18 12:16:35] <pdurbin> huh, and only two upvotes
[2019-10-18 12:17:00] <pdurbin> Do users know how important it is to upvote issues?
[2019-10-18 12:20:14] <viktomas> Maybe we could implement some kind of welcome message (or context menu item) to nudge people to give the Gitter team feedback by thumbing up issues that bother them.
[2019-10-18 12:22:29] <pdurbin> Do you treat all thumbs up equally? Whether from a key decision maker from the Jupyter project or some rando like me?
[2019-10-18 12:26:25] <viktomas> We've got our product direction represented in the [<-LINK->] but me personally I'm looking at the thumbs up to see what features/issues are the users interested in.
[2019-10-18 12:29:22] <pdurbin> Is this explained somewhere? How important voting is?
[2019-10-18 12:37:33] <pdurbin> I've been trying to explain to my open source community about the importance of a new voting mechanism I've set up that makes uses of boards on GitHub Projects (I'd like to support GitLab boards too, if that's possible): [<-LINK->] 
[2019-10-18 12:44:37] <viktomas> Similarly to you, we don't have a formalized process about how exactly/how much the votes contribute to our planning process. The votes are something I'm looking at and since they're roughly in sync with our roadmap I haven't given it much thought.
[2019-10-18 12:45:22] <pdurbin> I think about this stuff all the time. :)
[2019-10-18 12:47:28] <pdurbin> It's the whole "build the thing right" vs "build the right thing": [<-LINK->] 
[2019-10-18 13:33:15] <starlight-tu_gitlab> viktomas: I'm sorry, I didn't search repo for issues when submitting the problem. Working on devices with small screen is not my cup of tea :D
[2019-10-18 13:35:09] <starlight-tu_gitlab> Just for the record, I didn't mean to blame Gitter team or anyone for bugs. I just simply share my through of what I've experienced.
[2019-10-18 14:21:10] <mojuka1_twitter> hello, everyone.
[2019-10-18 14:21:28] <mojuka1_twitter> Could anyone to help me?
[2019-10-18 14:22:27] <mojuka1_twitter> i am developing with devexpress in c#. But i have some issue with xtragrid. Is there anyone who know about xtragrid?
[2019-10-18 14:27:47] <starlight-tu_gitlab> mojuka1_twitter: How about you raise your question in here: [<-LINK->] 
[2019-10-18 15:21:17] <starlight-tu_gitlab> Guy, how to build desktop app in Linux?I got this log while trying to gulp it [<-CODE->] 
[2019-10-18 15:23:57] <starlight-tu_gitlab> DId I miss something?
[2019-10-19 13:33:44] <puremourning> are you using node 10?
[2019-10-19 13:48:36] <starlight-tu_gitlab> Yes :D
[2019-10-21 05:29:21] <viktomas>  [<-LINK->] @starlight-tu_gitlabAt which point in the [<-LINK->] did you call the failedgulp:linux?
[2019-10-21 05:33:34] <viktomas>  [<-LINK->] @starlight-tu_gitlabI didn't see that as blaming at all :slight_smile:  I really appreciate your feedback, just wanted to set the expectations with native mobile apps.
[2019-10-21 20:40:29] <josemisierra> hello new to glitter. how do i leave a conversation
[2019-10-21 21:01:28] <pdurbin> once you get glitter on you, you can never get it off
[2019-10-22 02:35:45] <starlight-tu_gitlab> josemisierra: top corner (room setting) -> leave room. Everything seems stay the same, it just doesn't appear in conversations list and no more notification. (I think so)
[2019-10-22 06:24:54] <bongii> Did anybody suceed connecting to Gitter due mIrc?
[2019-10-22 07:45:54] <viktomas> bongii: It doesn't seem to be in the list of Howto's [<-LINK->] . Please consider contributing your howto when you finish configuration of your client :slight_smile:
[2019-10-22 16:43:24] <josemisierra> pdurbin: LOL
[2019-10-22 16:43:33] <pdurbin> :)
[2019-10-24 09:22:53] <viktomas> FYI: There has been a spam attack on Gitter support and there might be a delay in handling support tickets [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-10-24 09:58:11] <pdurbin> Thanks for dealing with it!
[2019-10-25 15:12:20] <ftab> hallelujah, thank you for the mark all as read
[2019-10-25 15:13:23] <ftab> there were apparently like 5 unread messages hanging out far back in the backlog in one channel and it kept bugging me
[2019-10-25 15:13:40] <ftab> i dunno why that bugs me while the 7002 unread emails in my inbox don't
[2019-10-25 15:13:56] <ftab> \_(ツ)_/
[2019-10-25 19:03:34] <sebbu2> i broke through 6 digits of unread mails
[2019-10-31 00:00:19] <BoNT325> Folks, feeling a bit lost here. Trying to join the gitter chat of an open source project, but whenever I try to view their Gitter link, it's completely blank.
[2019-10-31 00:01:26] <BoNT325> Not a 404, just blank. No rooms, no chat. I've authed Gitter to my private repos, just cannot join this chat and can't talk to anybody else working on the project because they don't use anything else.
[2019-10-31 00:16:59] <pdurbin> What's the link?
[2019-10-31 00:29:43] <MadLittleMods> BoNT325: As@pdurbinmentioned, please link the room and we can see if we can reproduce
[2019-10-31 00:33:27] <pdurbin> How's it going,@MadLittleMods?
[2019-10-31 00:43:27] <BoNT325> Right
[2019-10-31 00:43:51] <BoNT325>  [<-LINK->] 
[2019-10-31 00:44:39] <BoNT325> pdurbin: @MadLittleModsThere's the link.
[2019-10-31 01:13:48] <MadLittleMods> BoNT325:  [<-LINK->] doesn't have any public rooms. If there is a private room, you will need to be invited directly by someone already in the room
[2019-10-31 01:14:32] <BoNT325> Which is strange. It's supposed to be public, at least according to the owner.
[2019-10-31 01:14:45] <BoNT325> Is it possible it's an IRC room instead?
[2019-10-31 01:21:52] <MadLittleMods> BoNT325: They may have a completely separate IRC channel. But that's not a Gitter thing. Gitter rooms are Gitter based. The only IRC thing for Gitter is a bridge where you can access Gitter rooms from IRC, [<-LINK->] . But those rooms are also accessible on Gitter
[2019-10-31 01:22:34] <BoNT325> I see. I'll pester somebody for an invite then, thanks for clearing the confusion.
[2019-10-31 01:22:50] <MadLittleMods> BoNT325: If the owner expects the room to be public. Have them go through these steps, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-10-31 16:39:50] <psprint> Hello. How to increase font size in Linux desktop app?
[2019-10-31 18:08:55] <MadLittleMods> psprint: See [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-11-01 12:30:07] <psprint> MadLittleMods: I think that this URL says that it's unimplemented…
[2019-11-01 14:47:26] <MadLittleMods> psprint: Correct but there are some workarounds in the commentshttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/desktop/issues/28#note_34049641
https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/desktop/issues/28#note_34049645
[2019-11-01 14:48:26] <psprint> MadLittleMods: How to open the dev tools? I
[2019-11-01 14:48:40] <psprint> I'm not seeing them in the context menu
[2019-11-01 14:49:54] <MadLittleMods> @psprint I just updated the issue description with the workarounds directly to make it more clearThe devtools option is under the "Gitter" menu at the top
[2019-11-01 14:51:06] <psprint> ahso,
[2019-11-01 14:53:20] <psprint> It worked, thanks. The only problem was thatguiwasn't defined andwinalready has been
[2019-11-01 14:55:03] <psprint> plus also that the left column becomes unnecessarily wide with the zoom level 2...2.5
[2019-11-01 14:56:54] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] It's just a simple zoom, zooming everything. In the same vein, you can just adjust the font-size
[2019-11-01 14:58:56] <psprint> MadLittleMods: what's the field for the font size?
[2019-11-01 15:06:23] <MadLittleMods> psprint: I mean adjust the CSS in theElementstab of the dev tools. Change thebodytofont-size: 20pxfor example. These changes won't stick around if you close the window though (same with that zoom)
[2019-11-01 15:13:01] <psprint> MadLittleMods: it worked, thanks
[2019-11-02 10:53:29] <ghost~5dbd5f0cd73408ce4fcfbeae> Hi all! Is it possible to link my gitlab and my github account here on gitter?
[2019-11-02 14:13:42] <ghost~5dbd8982d73408ce4fcfc133> ghost: ~5dbd5f0cd73408ce4fcfbeae Just curious, how do you sign in here? because of your username.
[2019-11-02 14:20:19] <ghost~5dbd8982d73408ce4fcfc133> If I'm correct there are only three sign in methodsGitlab,GithubandTwitter, why other people don't have suffix in their username like mine (i.e._gitlab)?
[2019-11-02 14:26:18] <Rexogamer> Any plans for a dark mode on iOS?
[2019-11-02 14:26:43] <Rexogamer> also there’s a bug where channels, even when you view them and scroll to the bottom, do not automatically mark as read
[2019-11-02 14:27:08] <Rexogamer> Not even sending a message helps
[2019-11-03 17:13:07] <MadLittleMods> @ghost~5dbd5f0cd73408ce4fcfbeae @finn02_gitlab See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/accounts.md#gitter-accountGitHub users have no prefix on their username. You can track gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1851 for being able to set your username in the future
[2019-11-03 17:24:31] <MadLittleMods>  November 2, 2019 9:26 AM @Rexogamer We just had a big update on iOS thanks to the community and opted to just forgo dark mode to get the release out,  October 9, 2019 3:28 PM. Merge request for the release, gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-ios-app!6Mind creating an issue for messages not marking messages as read, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-ios-app/issues. In the simulator now, I am seeing it working but there is probably some weirdness around it that may require a tap to focus or just buggy
[2019-11-04 13:15:31] <tundeiness> Hi guys it's been a while I have been here, everything looks odd and I can't find my default chat room again..is there anything I have to do to get them back?
[2019-11-04 14:44:43] <imikay> hi guys what's the problem when running gitter I got  TypeError: OAuth2Strategy requires a clientID option? How to resolve it?
[2019-11-04 19:19:08] <vinayakpathak_gitlab> so I have signed in to gitter using both my github account and my gitlab account and I'm wondering if I can merge the two?
[2019-11-04 20:31:58] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @tundeinessDo you know the URI for your old room or community? There is a default room created when you create a community but there isn't a general default room, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-11-04 20:33:10] <MadLittleMods>  November 4, 2019 8:44 AM @imikay You just need to run through the configure secrets section again, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#configure-service-secrets [<-CODE->] 
[2019-11-04 20:33:45] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @vinayakpathak_gitlabSee [<-LINK->] 
[2019-11-04 20:39:53] <vinayakpathak_gitlab> oh ok, thanks
[2019-11-04 21:44:58] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @ehermesSomeone created an issue for the sign in problem you were seeing, [<-ISSUE->] (pinging in case you want to track it)
[2019-11-05 01:36:56] <imikay> After I run source .env I got this error Fatal Error: Unable to load internal client id.
[2019-11-05 12:12:06] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @imikayDid you skip any of GitLab or Twitter OAuth setup? (check your.envfile for empty spots) All of them are necessary for the webapp to run at the moment. There is an issue to make them optional in the future, [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-11-06 21:23:31] <kopax> Hi
[2019-11-06 21:23:37] <kopax> Is there any issue with gitter right now ?

[2019-11-07 15:47:16] <grazianocastellano> Hi guys, there is a way to export all the gitter's chat archive in a json folder ?
[2019-11-07 15:47:56] <XtremeGood> why don't you try scraping it
[2019-11-07 15:48:33] <XtremeGood> u can try selinium if u know java/pythonn etc
[2019-11-07 15:48:44] <XtremeGood> she what language it supports
[2019-11-07 15:53:34] <XtremeGood>  [<-LINK->] 
[2019-11-07 15:54:15] <XtremeGood> or simplest use ur browser's inspector and document.getelementByclasssname
[2019-11-07 15:55:11] <XtremeGood> run a loop and store chat[i].innerText
[2019-11-07 15:55:26] <XtremeGood> I think rest to just need to save it
[2019-11-07 15:56:15] <XtremeGood> use stringify json object
[2019-11-07 16:00:07] <viktomas> grazianocastellano: There is an open issue for exporting Gitter data [<-ISSUE->] in the meantime it is possible to use Gitter API to incrementally fetch all the messages: [<-LINK->] 
[2019-11-07 16:02:20] <grazianocastellano> viktomas: I tried to use the gitter api for python but there is the limit of 100 messages per chat
[2019-11-07 16:06:46] <viktomas> grazianocastellano: the limit is there to protect Gitter servers from processing large payloads in one request. You can usebeforeIdquery parameter for "pagination". The same parameter is used for infinite scrolling in this very chat.
[2019-11-07 16:08:23] <grazianocastellano> viktomas: i'll try, thanks for your help
[2019-11-07 18:00:40] <viktomas> grazianocastellano: No worries :)
[2019-11-08 13:50:02] <dwelle> Hello, what's the purpose of enabling threaded conversations in [<-LINK->] --- does it do anything?
[2019-11-08 13:51:16] <dwelle> Oh, I see.. it does nothing as a per-room toggle has been implementedgitlab-org/gitter/webapp!1620
[2019-11-08 16:35:48] <MadLittleMods> dwelle: You found the right spot. And there is a new issue to remove that toggle from [<-LINK->] , [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-11-08 16:40:07] <dwelle> MadLittleMods: we've been trying it over at cypress [<-LINK->] -- got some issues. How much ready can the feature be considered at this point?
[2019-11-08 16:42:10] <dwelle> In particular:cannot resize the panel (make it larger)
responses cannot span multiple lines (thus, can't use codeBlock etc.)
other syntax, like emoji doesn't work
[2019-11-08 17:10:30] <MadLittleMods> @dwelle It's in a basic state still under development. You can see the issues open, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues?label_name%5B%5D=threaded-conversationsMind creating an issue for the full syntax messages and multiline?
[2019-11-08 17:14:22] <MadLittleMods> dwelle: We haven't had resize on either the left-menu or right-toolbar as a conscious choice before. The thread panel is narrow and could use some extra space though. Let's create an issue to discuss
[2019-11-08 17:29:38] <dwelle> MadLittleMods: alright, I'll be sure to create some issues, later tonight or tomorrow
[2019-11-09 07:09:28] <readikus> Hey guys, I had some problems creating a community. [<-CODE->] I have since created it without adding people during the create stage.
[2019-11-09 19:38:34] <MadLittleMods> @readikus Mind creating an issue with the problem creating a community with people invited, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=community-creation. I have heard a few other cases of this beforeI think it might be best to just completely remove the invite step and opt to invite people afterwards
[2019-11-10 20:30:14] <Bartolomeus-649> Two questions...Where can I find the manual/documentation for the Gitter web-GUI?
Is it possible to do more advanced searches in the Gitter web-GUI? Like limit date range, only the current room, use boolean expression or perhaps even do regex searches?
[2019-11-10 22:58:31] <MadLittleMods> @Bartolomeus-649 The Gitter docs are here, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/tree/develop/docs#documentationSearch docs are here but those features aren't available, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/messages.md#searching-messagesIf you know raw Elasticsearch query stuff, you might be able to use it but I am not quite clear about usagesYou can track these search issues for progress in that area, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=Category%3ASearch

[2019-11-13 18:35:27] <kdund> Hi, all!I have a problem where the last unread message isnevermarked as read in a chatroom after I enabled threaded conversations. If I reply, my notification goes away, but all my chat partners get one instead until they write something. I tried turning off threaded conversations, but the notifications are still there!
[2019-11-13 18:39:20] <kdund>  [<-LINK->] 
[2019-11-13 20:41:11] <Rexogamer> same issue here
[2019-11-13 20:41:48] <Rexogamer> the app doesn’t automatically mark as read at all for me
[2019-11-13 20:43:53] <kdund> Thanks,@Rexogamer, just knowing it happens to others is a big help. for the meantime, I turned off threads, and then turned notifications for the affected channels off and on again, which removed the problem (but also threads) for now.

[2019-11-14 12:33:53] <axelsimon> Hi everyone, i've been hitting a nasty issue with Gitter itself: trying to create a community from/for a Github org i'm part of, when i reach the step where i can chose members to invite, Gitter throws aRealtime communications with the server have been disconnected. 401::Invalid access token
[2019-11-14 12:34:20] <axelsimon> after this, it throws itself into a loading loop and won't load anymore
[2019-11-14 12:34:31] <axelsimon> removing cookies related to gitter.im clears the problem
[2019-11-14 12:35:33] <axelsimon> This is on Firefox 70.0 on Fedora 30. Only add-on is uBlock (to be specific, tested on two instances of Firefox, one with only uBlock and one with quite a few more extensions)
[2019-11-14 14:14:12] <viktomas>  [<-LINK->] @kdundDoes clicking the notification banner (1 unread) button help? This has been an easiest way to integrate the threaded conversations with notifications, but I see that the banner might not look clickable. /cc@Rexogamer
[2019-11-14 14:16:19] <viktomas>  [<-LINK->] @axelsimonDoes clearing the cookies completely fixed the issue? I wonder whether there is a reliable way to reproduce it?
[2019-11-14 14:30:04] <kdund> Hi,@viktomas! you mean the one on the lower right in the main conversation scroll? In that case yes, I tried clicking that, but the notification persisted. I also tried clicking the (marked as )unread message itself, also without effect.
[2019-11-14 14:48:44] <viktomas> kdund: That’st he one I meant. I’m struggling to reproduce the issue. I’ve got a test room, submit a message in a thread using one member user and then when the other member user gets notification, I click on it, the new message shows and the notification disappears. It’s good that it happened to multiple people so we know that I just don’t have the right process for reproduction but the issue exists.
[2019-11-14 15:07:37] <viktomas> kdund: Thanks for reporting the issue. I've been able to reproduce it in the desktop app [<-ISSUE->] but both firefox and chrome on macOS seem to work fine.
[2019-11-14 15:08:51] <kdund> Thanks! (I should have remembered to put in OS+version to begin with)

[2019-11-14 15:51:03] <axelsimon> viktomas: it clears it in that I can then load gitter.im again and use this chat, which I'm currently doing to chat to you ;)
[2019-11-14 15:51:22] <axelsimon> but any attempt to create the community leads to the same issue
[2019-11-14 15:52:27] <axelsimon> oh, looks like my community did get created after all
[2019-11-14 15:52:29] <axelsimon> hmm
[2019-11-14 15:55:12] <axelsimon> no, apparently a colleague of mine created the room/community using Chromium
[2019-11-14 15:55:38] <axelsimon> that's depressing
[2019-11-14 17:52:04] <MadLittleMods> imikay: Please create an issue so we can track the problem better, [<-LINK->] . For reference, here are your previous messages, November 4, 2019 7:36 PM

[2019-11-14 18:02:00] <MadLittleMods>  November 14, 2019 9:50 AM @RUSshy I'm not sure how much space that saves in the room list, but your compact room-list is pretty interesting to me. If you create an merge request or issue to track it specifically, seems like something we can move forward with. There is an existing merge request you can work from and see the feedback we already had in this area, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp!1359I see you commented in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/253#note_244745670
[2019-11-14 18:03:26] <RUSshy> MadLittleMods: i'll check that, thanks!
[2019-11-14 20:04:12] <Rexogamer> viktomas: the notifications go away when I mark as unread, yes
[2019-11-14 20:04:35] <Rexogamer> actually this is odd, it’s working as it should
[2019-11-15 08:31:15] <complyue> is there a way to remove the conversation started only coz I accidentally clicked on a people's icon? no?
[2019-11-15 08:41:41] <complyue> seems can hide from webapp, but still shown in android app.
[2019-11-15 15:23:35] <MadLittleMods> @complyue You can only a hide a one to one room, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/rooms.md#hide-a-roomYou can track gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-android-app#94 and gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-android-app#103 for hiding to work in the Android app
[2019-11-15 16:27:09] <XonViegand_RBLX_twitter> Hey
[2019-11-15 16:27:17] <XonViegand_RBLX_twitter> Is there a place to talk about python game development?
[2019-11-15 16:27:22] <XonViegand_RBLX_twitter> I am making a text adventure game
[2019-11-15 16:29:01] <MadLittleMods> @XonViegand_RBLX_twitter Is there a specific Python library you are using? There might be a room for itYou can check out the Python rooms on the explore page, https://gitter.im/home/explore/tags/python
[2019-11-15 16:29:30] <XonViegand_RBLX_twitter> I use python 3
[2019-11-15 16:29:31] <XonViegand_RBLX_twitter> Thanks.
[2019-11-16 03:34:31] <complyue> MadLittleMods: Thanks for answer, but that means once I clicked a stranger's icon, I'll live with an empty conversation with him/her, in my rest life in gitter world. I'm supprised there's no ticket to address this issue.
[2019-11-16 04:15:31] <MadLittleMods> complyue: Those two issues I linked cover that case
[2019-11-16 08:49:11] <complyue> MadLittleMods: Okay, so I see now even a p2p conversation is generalized to a room in gitter concepts, though not intuitive at first. I still prefer a feature to remove accidental created conversations, but the second best is to hide them. Thanks.
[2019-11-20 04:15:09] <MadLittleMods> safield: For general developer conversation please use [<-LINK->] . This room is for support of Gitter, the chat app itself
[2019-11-22 14:54:40] <fedorov> Is it possible to have non-public rooms in gitter?
[2019-11-22 17:30:21] <MadLittleMods> fedorov: Yep, you can create private rooms, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-11-23 20:16:44] <jtroberts83> Will threaded conversations be added to the Gitter mobile app?  Currently threaded conversations from the web are not viewable via the app which is causing issues.
[2019-11-24 08:35:36] <MadLittleMods>  November 23, 2019 2:16 PM We don't have plans at the moment to add them to the Android/iOS apps but we would definitely welcome a merge request to add them. This sorta situation is why we are considering deprecating the Android/iOS apps, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#2281I was thinking that the messages would still show up in the main message feed but just out of context. Perhaps the hiding styles might be applying to the mobile assets as well which we could exclude there. cc @viktomas

[2019-11-29 03:38:33] <aacgood> Hi all - Just wondering if there are any current issues withWelcome messages?  If I have a welcome message setup when someone joins the room the message isnt displayed unless they go to #autojoin in the URL.  For instance, I know this room has a welcome message, but I never got it when I joined, but when I navigated to [<-LINK->] I did get the welcome.  Cheers
[2019-11-29 07:02:06] <grahamperrin> Re: [<-LINK->] is there a room where I can see threaded conversation in action?
[2019-11-29 09:14:06] <viktomas> grahamperrin: the cypress room is trying them out [<-LINK->] 
[2019-11-29 09:18:58] <viktomas> aacgood: The only open issue I can find is about including the welcome message on mobile [<-ISSUE->] it would make sense to show the message every time someone joins the room. Would you mind creating a feature request issue?
[2019-11-29 10:39:17] <aacgood> viktomas: yeah I can do, I'll aim to do it over the weekend. I have not been able to automatically trigger the welcome msg for a new user :(
[2019-11-29 10:39:28] <aacgood> ,
[2019-11-29 17:40:35] <grahamperrin> Recent archives e.g. [<-LINK->] are empty
[2019-11-29 20:41:18] <aacgood> viktomas: Raised issue [<-ISSUE->] for welcome message.  Cheers
[2019-11-29 22:23:07] <sixcorners> why is it so hard to see what my own name is without sending a message in a room?
[2019-11-29 22:23:46] <sixcorners> is there an account page? How do I sign in with gitlab?
[2019-11-29 22:23:52] <sixcorners> it's just creating a sixcorners_gitlab account
[2019-11-29 22:25:02] <sixcorners> shouldn't the user icon in the upper left have alt text or something?
[2019-11-29 22:27:05] <sixcorners> so I can tell what username I am using by going to the delete account menu, or I go to the image address of my icon, or I can start sending messages in a room to random people. great
[2019-11-29 22:41:46] <sixcorners> each link in the drop down menu when you click your own user icon has a huge margin that shows the pointer finger cursor but isn't clickable.
[2019-11-29 22:42:37] <sixcorners> the delete account window mentions oauth identities but it's not a link and I certainly don't see any oauth identities elsewhere.. is that mentioning a planned future feature that hasn't been gotten around to yet?
[2019-11-29 22:43:16] <sixcorners> this website is maximally frustrating. I think I would rather be using my bank's website.

[2019-11-30 04:22:42] <MadLittleMods>  November 29, 2019 4:23 PM @sixcorners Please create an issue for showing the username somewhere in the UI. An alt text tooltip sounds easy enough. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issuesYour OAuth identity is whatever you signed in with. In the future, you may be able to associate with multiple identities but currently it is just one.
[2019-11-30 04:26:18] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @sixcornersI see the separate issue with the padding/margin in the profile menu. The<li>has the padding but the inner<a>is what the the click event listener is on. Mind creating an issue, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-11-30 08:34:46] <grahamperrin> grahamperrin: thanks@MadLittleMods… I guessed there'd be an existing bug (I recall the symptoms from a past bug).

[2019-12-02 13:31:48] <helenou> Hello, i searched without luck a solution to reload my updated avatar on gitter.im android
[2019-12-02 13:32:09] <helenou> Clearing cache and even app data didn't change avatar to recent
[2019-12-02 13:33:13] <vicek22_gitlab> helenou: is the avatar in the web application (e.g. [<-LINK->] ) correct?
[2019-12-02 13:43:00] <helenou> yes it s updated on webapp
[2019-12-02 13:53:28] <helenou> even if i go all the way to uninstall reinstall the app, the avatar remains the older one
[2019-12-02 14:39:47] <helenou> vicek22_gitlab: weirdly in the android app, my avatar is updated in the conversations, not in the menu
[2019-12-02 14:43:26] <cbj4074> helenou: This issue has been raised several times before and it seems to resolve itself eventually. There are several points at which the image is cached and all of them will expire, eventually. Unfortunately, there probably isn't any simple means by which to force an update.
[2019-12-02 14:44:23] <cbj4074> If it's helpful, the one I see now is a cartoony one (not sure if that's the old or new)
[2019-12-02 15:19:43] <helenou> Both are cartoons. Prévois us still showing un the app menu
[2019-12-02 15:30:03] <cbj4074> Do they both have a bright blue shirt? It's possible that you're seeing the old one, but everyone else is seeing the new one. That has been reported many times.
[2019-12-02 20:23:25] <helenou> Nope the one in chat us correct. Thé old gas black hair ans i Can der on the app menu
[2019-12-02 20:26:19] <cbj4074> Hehe, but you are the only person who can see the app menu with your old avatar, correct? It will self-correct eventually

[2019-12-04 15:30:50] <viktomas> thobson: I'm looking into it but so far I don't see any reason why that error could occur
[2019-12-04 15:34:17] <thobson> viktomas: I dont know if this helps but i have some form of correlation id: [<-CODE->] 
[2019-12-04 15:37:21] <viktomas> thobson: the ID helped a lot. This is the error message on the serverInvalid URL: http://f: A =&gt; F[(A, B
[2019-12-04 15:38:20] <viktomas> thobson: I think our markdown parsing might be failing on parsing some URL in your message, is that possible?
[2019-12-04 15:38:49] <thobson> viktomas: possibly - I will check my message ..
[2019-12-04 15:40:56] <thobson> viktomas: - thanks for your help! i missed a trailing backtick
[2019-12-04 15:43:55] <viktomas> thobson: No worries, would you mind creating an issue in Gitter project ( [<-LINK->] ) with the message that caused500? Would be nice to fix the markdown processing to at least return400instead of500or just discard the URL..
[2019-12-04 15:44:23] <thobson> viktomas: - sure
[2019-12-05 14:51:52] <jax200> I am new to this.  How to jump to the first (or earlier) messages in a room (aside from scrolling for two weeks) ???    (Please don't send me to Rick Astley.)
[2019-12-05 15:34:21] <cbj4074> Never gonna give you up! Never gonna let you down...
[2019-12-05 15:37:28] <viktomas> jax200: you can visit the archive (SelectArchivesoption in the room settings dropdown)
[2019-12-07 12:21:58] <dwelle> is there a way to search for posts by given user? I'm specifically interested in search my own posts when I need to refer to something I wrote.
[2019-12-07 12:35:58] <Mrich.com_gitlab> Hey guys I'm  new on Opensource
[2019-12-07 12:37:44] <pdurbin> We were all new once. Do you use a lot of open source?
[2019-12-07 17:12:32] <jax200> viktomas: thx    the archives calendar little green boxes not always associated with a day's activity.   perhaps something not right with the server.
[2019-12-07 17:15:18] <jax200> pdurbin: "We were all new once"     Like the statement.  Underscores why we should help others.
[2019-12-07 17:51:30] <pdurbin> jax200: I'm glad you agree :)
[2019-12-07 18:11:59] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @dwelleYou can usefrom:dwelleto find your own messages, see [<-LINK->] 
[2019-12-07 18:15:07] <dwelle> MadLittleMods: thanks. It seems to find a very tiny subset of messages.
[2019-12-07 18:16:18] <dwelle> from last ~month or so
[2019-12-07 18:21:19] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @jax200Switching away from the heatmap in the archive has been discussed before and I just created an issue to track a change for a standard calendar view, [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-12-07 18:22:55] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @dwelleThefrom:xxxsearch has been known to have some problems. You can track this issue, [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-12-07 18:37:12] <dwelle> MadLittleMods: I see. Thx.
[2019-12-07 18:41:08] <jax200> MadLittleMods: Any discussion to explore feature to toggle from linear to tree thread format?
[2019-12-07 19:21:33] <MadLittleMods> jax200: Threaded conversations is under development now and you can try it out if you toggle it in the room settings. Perhaps you mean this though, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-12-07 19:29:32] <bjorno43> Is there some kind of bug in Gitter for deleting messages as room Admin? Whenever I visit one of our community rooms, I can still delete messages in it just fine. But as soon as I switch to another room and back to that room, the option is grayed out. I still have all the other normal Admin options available to me just fine. Browser refresh does not solve it and it only happens the first time. After that, the option is grayed out forever, even after restarting the browser
[2019-12-07 19:34:35] <MadLittleMods> @bjorno43 Looks like a bug. I can reproduce. Please create an issue and we'll get on it, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issuesThere was a recent change around the chat actions that could have caused this, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/merge_requests/1634/diffs#6e88d9a7c0f00b63e378cb4ed2372074d9a8b1ac_0_10
[2019-12-07 19:36:40] <bjorno43> Alright, thanks a lot@MadLittleModsI'll get onto creating that issue :)
[2019-12-07 19:42:14] <bjorno43> Done, issue created
[2019-12-07 19:44:14] <MadLittleMods> bjorno43: Thanks for creating it  [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-12-08 19:28:01] <jax200> MadLittleMods: Don't see a toggle in room settings.   ;   (
[2019-12-08 23:49:58] <MadLittleMods> @jax200 Room settings dropdown -> Settings -> Enable threaded conversations

[2019-12-09 01:10:44] <jax200> MadLittleMods: I'm exhausted reading all the docs to fix this.
[2019-12-09 01:18:03] <MicahZoltu> If I Hide a room, will I still see notifications of new messages in that room?
[2019-12-09 01:18:13] <MicahZoltu> Particularly for "rooms" that are just DMs between me and another person.
[2019-12-09 01:18:24] <MicahZoltu> I have a giant list of them and I want to close them all, but if the person messages me I want to get notified.
[2019-12-09 01:27:15] <MadLittleMods>  December 8, 2019 7:10 PM @jax200 It looks like you are considered an admin of the room. Can you link the room?If it's connected to GitHub, run through these steps https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/faq.md#why-isnt-my-github-organisation-or-repos-appearing
[2019-12-09 01:27:50] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @MicahZoltuIf the person messages you again, it will unhide the room
[2019-12-09 01:28:07] <MicahZoltu> Great, thanks!
[2019-12-09 01:28:17] <MadLittleMods> MicahZoltu: Docs around this are here, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-12-09 17:59:22] <martindsouza_gitlab> I'm trying to create a community and getting an error about Github repo. What does a community after to do with Github?
[2019-12-09 18:03:02] <martindsouza_gitlab> Also trying to figure out Community vs Rooms concept (I'm new to Gitter looking at moving some Slack communities over)
[2019-12-09 18:03:53] <viktomas> martindsouza_gitlab: Does the community you are trying to create have the same name as an organisation on GitHub? We are currently reserving those names for owners of the GitHub orgs (AFAIK) but we are planning to remove that logicgitlab-org/gitter/webapp!1680
[2019-12-09 18:05:22] <MadLittleMods> @martindsouza_gitlab Docs for community creation https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/communities.md#community-creationYou create a community(like a Slack workspace), then create many rooms inside the community
[2019-12-09 18:08:07] <MadLittleMods> @martindsouza_gitlab To be clear, you can still create a Gitter community if it clashes with something on GitHub, you just need to associate the GitHub org with the Gitter community via the "GitHub projects" link on the first stepIf you don't see your GitHub org listed, you can run through these steps: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/faq.md#why-isnt-my-github-organisation-or-repos-appearingIf you provide the URI for the community you are trying to create, I can explain it directly
[2019-12-09 18:20:52] <martindsouza_gitlab> viktomas: Thanks. The community I'm trying to create is the same name as an individual's (not me) Github account.
[2019-12-09 18:30:29] <martindsouza_gitlab> MadLittleMods: What is the business plan for Gitter? the FAQ says it’s free for public and private communities. Is that sustainable for the long term? Reason I’m asking is curious what the business model will be before investing time into moving a community over. I’m fine if there will be a paid version of it, just good to know the pricing model in advance.
[2019-12-09 18:33:28] <MadLittleMods> martindsouza_gitlab: There is no monetization strategy in place or planned at the moment. It's mostly a case of getting people familiar with GitLab. We just updated the strategy page to make this more clear, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-12-09 18:34:20] <MadLittleMods>  December 9, 2019 12:20 PM @martindsouza_gitlab In that case, the individual themself needs to sign in with GitHub and create the communityOtherwise, you will need to adjust the URI to not clash
[2019-12-09 18:35:38] <martindsouza_gitlab> MadLittleMods: Thanks.
[2019-12-10 19:36:29] <bjorno43> MadLittleMods: I've seen that my issue has been merged and solved. Does this mean it should be solved live now? Or will it be solved with the next update?
[2019-12-10 20:03:14] <akoeplinger> hello   I've started seeing 502 errors from [<-LINK->] about an hour ago in my app
[2019-12-10 20:13:14] <akoeplinger> ah actually looks like the 502 started on November 21st already. so something else happened today that impacts my gitter streaming api connection
[2019-12-10 20:42:23] <MadLittleMods> @akoeplinger There something going wrong with the Websocket servers (just recent). Going to create an issue. What are you seeing that gives you November 21st as a date?
[2019-12-10 20:56:33] <MadLittleMods> akoeplinger: You can track our progress here [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-12-10 20:57:51] <MadLittleMods>  December 10, 2019 1:36 PM @bjorno43 Any recent merges will come part of the next upcoming release, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#20110-upcomingCurrently Gitter 20.10.0 is on staging/next, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp!1667
[2019-12-10 21:00:50] <akoeplinger> MadLittleMods: I saw it in a graph in our logging but I must've done something wrong since it shows them going further back now. and in fact they look expected since each of them has a request duration of exactly 120seconds, which I think is part of the streaming api?
[2019-12-10 21:01:45] <akoeplinger> so yeah it's probably the one you mentioned that's impacting me, sorry :)
[2019-12-10 21:04:01] <akoeplinger> ah I figured out why I was getting bogus data, I only selected one of the servers lol
[2019-12-10 21:09:07] <MadLittleMods> akoeplinger: Perhaps you are falling back to long-polling from thewsendpoint but could be the streaming API (not sure what you are using)
[2019-12-10 21:09:40] <MadLittleMods> Sounds like you have a bot/server interacting with Gitter ♀
[2019-12-10 21:10:37] <MadLittleMods> akoeplinger: There is an issue about a recent uptick in 504's which is related but I don't think connected to this separate outage now, [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-12-10 21:24:36] <advonesix> How do you leave a private chat in gitter.im ?
[2019-12-10 21:24:47] <advonesix> like one between just two people
[2019-12-10 21:26:05] <MadLittleMods> advonesix: You can only hide a one to one room [<-LINK->] 
[2019-12-10 21:27:14] <advonesix> interesting.
[2019-12-10 21:27:15] <advonesix> ok thanks
[2019-12-10 21:29:13] <advonesix> Hmmm. I accidentally opened a chat with a user whose username is "MySQL". Never said a word to him or her. When I click on Hide chat, nothing happens, and they are still in my sidebar on the left
[2019-12-10 21:32:14] <advonesix> nevermind, it just took a couple minutes to kick in for some reason. Seems to have worked though
[2019-12-10 21:43:24] <MadLittleMods> advonesix: The delay is probably related to [<-ISSUE->] . The request sends off fine but the update coming back to you over the WebSocket connection is slow/delayed
[2019-12-11 13:00:08] <akoeplinger> websocket connections seem to be working fine again for me, thank you 
[2019-12-11 16:14:00] <MadLittleMods> akoeplinger: Thanks for the feedback. We were able to get things in shape last evening, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-12-12 19:29:31] <akutheman> Last line of chat log often renders only top half of the text
[2019-12-12 19:29:45] <akutheman> Almost like the text box is a bit too tall
[2019-12-12 19:30:32] <MadLittleMods> akutheman: You can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-12-12 19:30:40] <akutheman>  [<-LINK->] 
[2019-12-12 19:31:09] <akutheman> MadLittleMods: thanks, it's driving me nuts
[2019-12-12 19:31:50] <MadLittleMods> akutheman: Curious, are you seeing outside of the page-loaded room?
[2019-12-12 19:32:05] <akutheman> not sure what that means
[2019-12-12 19:32:21] <MadLittleMods> akutheman: Once you switch rooms, do you see the cut-off latest message anymore?
[2019-12-12 19:32:37] <akutheman> yeah, sometimes
[2019-12-12 19:32:46] <akutheman> even a refresh doesn't get rid of it sometimes
[2019-12-12 19:32:59] <MadLittleMods> akutheman: I only ever see it on refresh on the first page-loaded room. Once I switch rooms, it goes away
[2019-12-12 19:33:10] <MadLittleMods> akutheman: But good info, mind adding that to the issue?
[2019-12-12 19:35:12] <akutheman> I don't have a GitLab acccount so can't updateMaking a bit smaller window than maximized is a good way to reproduce for me. If I maximize, the issue is typically gone. When I restore the window, it's back.
[2019-12-12 19:35:28] <akutheman> But not consistent.
[2019-12-12 19:36:38] <akutheman> Maybe something silly like adding a 15 px spacer after the last message as a workaround. Because it's a really really annoying bug on a chat platform.
[2019-12-12 19:42:11] <MadLittleMods> akutheman: Ahh, that's a great way to reproduce  which will probably make this way easier to fix. I updated the issue with your nice reproduction instructions [<-LINK->] 
[2019-12-12 19:42:25] <MadLittleMods> I'll have a look at this again later on today
[2019-12-12 19:43:24] <akutheman> Thanks@MadLittleMods!
[2019-12-13 11:09:32] <SQL-MisterMagoo> Hi@MadLittleMods- is there a known problem with search? I am not seeing anything from recent months, for example this search "from:madlittlemods" returns posts from May 6th
[2019-12-13 18:13:27] <MadLittleMods> @SQL-MisterMagoo The Elasticsearch rivers were out of date a few days ago but they are good to go now gitlab-com/gl-infra/infrastructure#8657 [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
[2019-12-13 19:06:36] <SQL-MisterMagoo> Yes, seems to be up to date again, thanks
[2019-12-14 14:16:53] <ftab> I do not appear to be getting notifications for PMs on my iPhone despite my notification settings being set to all. I'm running the last TestFlight build, does that have anything to do with it?
[2019-12-14 20:39:19] <MadLittleMods> @ftab It looks like you are running 4.3.5 which is the normal prod right now (there is a 4.4.0 on TestFlight) but the update has nothing to do with notifications.Were you getting notifications before? [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
[2019-12-14 20:45:59] <MadLittleMods> ftab: Just created [<-ISSUE->] to track themobile-notify-user.jsnot being able to send out a push notification. Probably highly related to the notification gateway also not being able to send out push notifications
[2019-12-15 00:31:59] <ftab> Thanks for the update@MadLittleMods- it sounds like I left a tab open or something. Oddly enough I was getting vibrations & sounds that I didn't know where they were coming from cause I didn't get any banners, but from the looks of it it was from Gitter.
[2019-12-15 00:34:52] <ftab> As in it sent my phone sounds and badges but not banners
[2019-12-15 00:36:39] <MadLittleMods> ftab: Are you seeing push notifications now?
[2019-12-15 00:43:55] <ftab> MadLittleMods: try one more, I was in the app and didn't hear anything (might be worth a separate issue, in-app notifications )
[2019-12-15 00:44:20] <ftab> I'm actually seeing a different issue at this very moment, I'm not seeing the messages I've sent just now
[2019-12-15 01:13:23] <MadLittleMods> ftab: I sent one again a bit ago
[2019-12-15 02:05:23] <ftab> MadLittleMods: yeah still missing them unfortunately. Is it because of the desktop signin, or is that unrelated?
[2019-12-15 02:36:53] <ftab> I closed the desktop browser tab, will let you know if I see any notifications
[2019-12-19 01:29:25] <vito-c> is there a github questions room on gitter? I'm trying to figure out if there is a way to preserve tags when you execute a "Squash and Merge"
[2019-12-19 03:31:53] <MadLittleMods> @vito-c There is a general developer room, https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/developersBut I don't know of a specific GitHub help roomThere is a GitLab help room, https://gitter.im/gitlabhq/gitlabhq
[2019-12-20 10:19:50] <MarkoShiva> how to run gitter app on linux? I constantly get error of not being able to run. I submitted a bug report as issue in gitlab but that merge request 215 is making gitter on windows have some bugs.
[2019-12-20 10:20:28] <MarkoShiva> I run desktop app for a long time but I can't run it on arch for already a half month
[2019-12-20 16:31:59] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @in1t3rYou can checkoutgitlab-org/gitter/desktop!215and run the development version, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-12-20 23:25:22] <MadLittleMods> @Narvey Try in https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/developersThis room is for support for Gitter, the chat app itself
[2019-12-20 23:26:13] <Narvey> Did you move my message?
[2019-12-20 23:27:29] <MadLittleMods> Narvey: No, just cleaned it up since a bit off-topic here. I just sent a one to one message to you with your message in case you wanted to copy/paste it
[2019-12-20 23:27:46] <Narvey> perfect
[2019-12-22 09:25:28] <MarkoShiva> thx@MadLittleModsWell I did checkout "h-michael/desktop-update-nw-0.41.2" and npm install and added oauth.json credentials but when I run it I only get nw app not a gitter app.
[2019-12-22 09:30:41] <MarkoShiva> I also get the error[4114849:4114849:1222/103007.040697:ERROR:component_loader.cc(164)] Failed to parse extension manifest
[2019-12-22 19:34:49] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
[2019-12-22 19:35:24] <MadLittleMods> Or it's just Chromium version mismatch complaining about some change in the extensions (all internal NW.js stuff)
[2019-12-22 19:38:19] <MadLittleMods> MarkoShiva: From [<-ISSUE->] , it sounds like you need to make sure npm is installing the SDK version of NW.js which should be specified and install but something may be going wonky
[2019-12-22 22:09:20] <MarkoShiva> MadLittleMods: the icon starts but I can't access the app I only have the icon which when right click there is only Exit Gitter option. same error in terminal
[2019-12-22 22:11:40] <MarkoShiva> What to change to install SDK verson of NW.js not sure as I'm new to npm stuff
[2019-12-22 22:12:34] <MarkoShiva> Btw I also removed config files from earlier installation on my system.
[2019-12-22 22:14:19] <MarkoShiva>  [<-CODE->] 
[2019-12-22 22:16:46] <MarkoShiva> previously run the npm install and created oauth.json according to instructions generated oauth on github and replaced stuff that should be replaced.
[2019-12-22 22:17:49] <MarkoShiva> like os Linux and clientid and secretkey. Btw I run archlinux is there something that need to be installed for development version to actually run or all can be installed via npm
[2019-12-22 22:54:49] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @akuthemanA fix has been merged but not shipped to production. It will be part of [<-LINK->] 
[2019-12-22 22:55:30] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @MarkoShivaLet's move to [<-LINK->] , can you summarize your problem there as well
[2019-12-23 20:11:07] <Narvey> How do I jump back to the chat that someone was replying to?
[2019-12-24 01:52:19] <MadLittleMods> Narvey: If you click the permalink, it will jump to the chat message in question. If you want to jump back to the latest, there will be a little badge in the bottom-right if you are scrolled too far away from the latest
[2019-12-24 01:52:53] <MadLittleMods> Narvey: But I think you are after [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-12-24 01:55:02] <nafg> Please make DMs make it orange like at-mentions

[2019-12-27 08:00:18] <MadLittleMods> dns2utf8: The Gitter and matrix.org systems don't share any backend. I'm not sure how that you are blocked on matrix.org. Probably better to use the Matrix support [<-LINK->] 
[2019-12-28 23:15:20] <markotitel> Hi to everybody.Is there to read about Gitter infrastructure?
[2019-12-28 23:15:46] <MadLittleMods> markotitel: There is [<-LINK->] 
[2019-12-28 23:16:04] <MadLittleMods> markotitel: But the main infrastructure project is private, [<-LINK->] 
[2019-12-28 23:22:05] <markotitel> Thank you. Are there important differences in the setup in the "private part" = )
[2019-12-28 23:23:02] <markotitel> And if I'm not asking too much, where is the infrastructure hosted?
[2019-12-28 23:23:37] <markotitel> Ah stupid question.
[2019-12-28 23:23:50] <markotitel> I see there are a lot of services behind.
[2019-12-28 23:23:59] <markotitel> MadLittleMods: thanks again.
[2019-12-28 23:24:31] <markotitel> I'm a smalltown devops looking for a good read. Don't like Netflix.
[2019-12-29 01:45:20] <MadLittleMods> @markotitel It's all in AWS. The private part is just private because it hasn't been sanitized of secretsJust sets up those same services in a robust manner with Ansible (some Terraform)

[2019-12-31 13:00:59] <therichaverma> Hello there ! I just started contributed in Opensource , i chose pywikibot project from wikimedia foundation .I am having problem in generating user files , Can anyone help me out ?
[2019-12-31 13:08:39] <pdurbin> therichaverma: hi! I went to a talk where these bots were mentioned. I think they have a support site or a way to contact them.
[2019-12-31 13:11:01] <pdurbin> Yeah, one of the last slides from here mentions several support channels: [<-LINK->] 
[2019-12-31 20:07:55] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @edwinfrancisd_gitlabYou can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2019-12-31 20:08:41] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @therichavermaThis room is for support for Gitter, the chat app itself. For general developer questions, you can use [<-LINK->] 
[2020-01-01 13:46:23] <Angeles89> I don't want my team's chat history searchable publicly.  How do I make my Gitter rooms private and accessible to members only?  To answer my own question, I tried Googling 'chat history gitter private room' and 'make gitter room private' (with similar search term variations) and what I find are answers to questions about accessing and managing private GitHub repo permissions which is not at all what I am looking for.  I can't find a doc with the answer to my intial question:  how do I make my  existing Gitter room private?
[2020-01-02 02:32:06] <MadLittleMods> @Angeles89 Here are some docs around room security https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/rooms.md#room-securityThere isn't a way to change the room security after creation but you can send an email to support@gitter.im with the details and we can change them for you
[2020-01-03 02:40:14] <Angeles89> Thanks@MadLittleModsfor the suggestion. ;)
[2020-01-07 15:07:32] <gohluhng_gitlab> Hi, I just signed up with a gitlab account (as far as I can tell, there's no way to sign up directly, which would be my preference)
[2020-01-07 15:08:08] <gohluhng_gitlab> How do I get rid of the ugly_gitlabsuffix on my nick?
[2020-01-07 15:57:20] <MadLittleMods> @gohluhng_gitlab Heya, see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/accounts.md#can-i-change-my-usernameThe only way not to have a suffix is to sign in with GitHub. You can track gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1851 for custom username
[2020-01-07 16:04:26] <gohluhng_gitlab> Thanks, I'll probably just close this account and re-register with a GitHub account then.
[2020-01-09 10:01:07] <tobbi_gitlab> It's weird, I was just looking for that question :D
[2020-01-09 10:01:08] <tobbi_gitlab> The last one.
[2020-01-10 23:58:30] <FSX> Hi. I can't see new messages on the Android app. I have to close it so it reloads a channel.
[2020-01-11 00:15:09] <MadLittleMods> @FSX Just tested and I am able to see new messages in the Android app as they come in.There is a related issue, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-android-app/issues/2/. Does it apply to you?
[2020-01-11 00:17:46] <FSX> That looks like it.
[2020-01-13 16:17:07] <kdund> Hi, all!Is there an easy way to share chatrooms in a gitter chat?
[2020-01-13 16:18:35] <kdund> for example if a thread is becoming large, I would like to type: lets have this discussion in Org/new_thread_room and then ideally make that room (or alternatively point to an existing/newly created room)Currently I could go to the new room, press share and copy the link then paste it in the original thread, but that breaks the flow quite a bit
[2020-01-13 16:22:55] <kdund> (Even better would be if the thread could then be made part of the new room, but I understand if that is too much of a challenge)
[2020-01-13 19:53:39] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] Copying the URL in the address bar once you create the room is the easiest. Otherwise the the share option you found is the other way.Feel free to create an issue about your ideal flow around creating a new room from a thread, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues
[2020-01-13 19:56:02] <kdund> MadLittleMods: That already helps make it faster, cheers!
[2020-01-13 20:01:55] <kdund> Made a wishlist here: [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-01-16 20:03:40] <ericmartinezr> Can we get a little bit of help by deleting this weird message [<-LINK->] ? :P
[2020-01-16 20:03:42] <ericmartinezr> thx
[2020-01-16 20:26:56] <ericmartinezr> A few more here [<-LINK->] 
[2020-01-16 23:18:53] <MadLittleMods> ericmartinezr: Thanks for the reports. Removed them

[2020-01-17 11:24:07] <ericmartinezr> Thank you@MadLittleMods
[2020-01-18 22:12:15] <sebbu2> weird, i was disconnected saying "i must authenticate"

[2020-01-21 07:17:09] <tebeco> hello there ;)when being member (not admin or whatever) of a public gitter channelis there a way to mute another member message or at least the notification when she/he speaks in a particular channel ?i don't mind seeing the message when i go there but it just keeps asking non sense questionso the phone notification goes likes hellmakes me want to leave 1 community for 1 kid i guess
[2020-01-21 07:17:51] <tebeco> (using gitter iOS, do i have to login on webpage ?)
[2020-01-21 09:58:42] <viktomas> tebeco: , there is currently no way to mute one particular person in a room. You can change your notifications toAnnouncementswhich means you'll get notified only when you are mentioned or room admin makes anouncement. [<-LINK->] . If the user disturbs the community I guess the admin could warn/ban them.
[2020-01-21 09:59:57] <tebeco> well that's not usuableexample : there's a troll in an open community and no moderator active
[2020-01-21 10:01:21] <tebeco> in my case it's a developer asking things like "how do i do a for loop" (but 10 question per week like this) and pointing him toward howto/docs/fundamentals/...."just give me working code"
[2020-01-21 10:38:55] <viktomas> We do have an existing issue for what you are talking about@tebeco [<-ISSUE->] , it's part of the [<-LINK->] but we are currently not working on it.
[2020-01-21 10:39:56] <viktomas> If the user shows any kind of abusive behavior, please contactsupport@gitter.imand we can handle the case. If they have annoying questions and the room is unmoderated, there is currenlty no way to mute a single user.
[2020-01-22 05:25:40] <NguyenJeremyT> Hi! What languages does Glitter currently support? Thank you.
[2020-01-22 06:01:02] <tebeco> thx Tomas for the quick answer and yes it's a redundant annoying flow of questiona mute would be the perfect way here even if the channel were moderatedi'm honestly surprised it done not exists already ... just for anti harassment purpose it it was more severe or intentionalbasically it means that a user cannot do anything without the need of reaching out to a mod or to gitter ?
[2020-01-22 07:29:37] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @NguyenJeremyTDo you mean syntax language support in code blocks? We support these languages, [<-LINK->] 
[2020-01-22 07:31:15] <MadLittleMods> tebeco: If you encounter any abuse or spam, you can report it here orsupport@gitter.im
[2020-01-22 07:35:41] <MadLittleMods> tebeco: For spam/abuse, you can also use theReportaction for any message which will take some automatic action once the threshold is reached, [<-LINK->] 
[2020-01-22 07:36:03] <tebeco> i think you wanted to ping@NguyenJeremyTabout the language ;) i
[2020-01-22 07:36:40] <MadLittleMods> tebeco: Updated, thanks 
[2020-01-22 07:40:46] <tebeco> @MadLittleModsyes exactly the issue hereit basically means that a users cannot have a direct way to solves issuesthe issue i have is minorjust think if it was about sexist borderline comments but it's judge to be ok because "borderline" it's just a slap in the handbut the people receive these message will still get the message / see them even if they don't wantthe mute button is when the client/consumer of gitter still get that choicetoday there's just no choice "someone will decide for you"either community mod (in large community it's very rare because of the flow / timezone / community first "its ok")or gitter but does not solves basics human interaction of people just not whipping to change will on the book the "did nothing wrong" (very bad reference not intended)
[2020-01-22 07:42:43] <MadLittleMods> @tebeco Agreed, mute/block functionality is good and we have gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#370 to track that featureA couple hours ago, I discussed a potential slimmed down client-side version with @viktomas that could be more easily implemented. I am formulating some thoughts to go in that issue soon. Some of it already mentioned in the issue but will put some more pieces together
[2020-01-22 07:43:31] <MadLittleMods> tebeco: Do you have any interest in making a contribution to add this sort of functionality?
[2020-01-22 07:43:41] <tebeco> my case is an immature user spamming google question in a channel where notification is very usefulturning the notification off would just be like i uninstall gitter to be honest so that's kinda badon the other hand times to times few people are willing to help him when the question are more elaboratei mean it's a community to help so you can't kick people out
[2020-01-22 07:44:43] <tebeco> because he's right about asking but it's me being feed up after ~10 question "thing don't run" or "how to compress image" in like 2 day ^^
[2020-01-22 07:46:32] <tebeco> (he just need to search a bit around before dumping "what is 1+1", it will takes time but he might get there ^^) just need time to understand that ^^
[2020-01-22 07:46:39] <MadLittleMods> tebeco: Sounds like a help vampire which should be removed from the community. You seem like a pretty active member of that community. Are you able to contact one of the existing admins to add you as another admin to look after things?
[2020-01-22 08:07:06] <MadLittleMods> tebeco: Added some notes about the MVP for muting a user, [<-LINK->] 
[2020-01-22 09:11:28] <tebeco> Sounds like a help vampire which should be removed from the communityi love the comparison ;)if i was nice i would just say that he's just young so impatient, doesn't mean to kick people out ^^ just need to be ignored ;) i tried to helped, spoke to a walltime to time i see other people trying to help him anyway sooo "why not"
[2020-01-22 09:13:52] <tebeco> again@MadLittleModsthx a lot for taking time to answer
[2020-01-22 11:29:49] <tebeco> arg
[2020-01-22 11:29:52] <tebeco> This won't address the email notifications, iOS/Android apps, IRC, or any other API clients.
[2020-01-22 11:32:37] <tebeco> i just saw that ^^does it means that the iOS app will still show the notification circle + banner ;) ?what's the alternative for iOS user than the store app ? by that i mean keeping a tab open in a browser is not really possible / ideal as notification of the phone is not possible (and the UX is to be polished a bit)is there an installable PWA somehow / flight hub ? anything ?
[2020-01-22 11:35:14] <sebbu2> jailbreak and cydia
[2020-01-22 11:36:01] <tebeco> :f can't / won't / don't want
[2020-01-22 11:36:40] <sebbu2> installing apps directly from osx and xcode
[2020-01-22 11:36:52] <sebbu2> using testflight or other to install "entreprise only" apps
[2020-01-22 11:37:01] <sebbu2> or testing apps
[2020-01-22 11:37:03] <tebeco> jailbreakung a phone because of spam in 1 user in one community is a bit much
[2020-01-22 11:37:42] <sebbu2> the 2 other solutions don't need jailbreaking and you can still install apps not from appstore
[2020-01-22 11:38:25] <tebeco> going to grab lunch and re read ^^
[2020-01-22 11:45:32] <tebeco> installing from Mac idea if i find someone that have a MAC ^^ (it means build & deploy/publish i guess ? the PWA ?)
[2020-01-22 11:46:26] <tebeco> TestFlight seems perfect to be honestis there a way to see the PWA in the hub or do i have to subscribe somewhere ?
[2020-01-22 13:11:43] <viktomas> what's the alternative for iOS user than the store app ? by that i mean keeping a tab open in a browser is not really possible / ideal as notification of the phone is not possible (and the UX is to be polished a bit)is there an installable PWA somehow / flight hub ? anything ?@tebeco We are planning on improving our PWA implementation and enabling it by default soon gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1992 this way the service worker in our browser will receive notifications.As a side note, the iOS app is open-source and available here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-ios-app  but our team doesn't have enough capacity to fully support the native apps gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#2281 that's why we are going to put more effort in the PWA implementation
[2020-01-22 13:26:28] <Redsandro> I cannot find any open issues about this: On a private room, I have a Github integration with a private repository. After approving Gitter access in Github, it started showing all commits to the repo. However, in stead of a popup with a summary, it shows the following popup:Error - Commit not found. Please check that Gitter has permission to view it.I've been checking the settings of both the Gitter room and the Github repo, but there is no obvious step I missed. Anyone knows what's missing?
[2020-01-22 13:30:34] <Redsandro> Right after writing this, I find the option under the top rightuser thumbnail -> Allow Repo Access.I guess that was literally the last place I looked.
[2020-01-22 14:24:45] <viktomas> Redsandro: this looks like [<-LINK->] would you mind [<-LINK->] or MR to add there more information about what should user do when Gitter doesn't have enough permissions?
[2020-01-23 13:18:19] <psprint> Hi. I'm trying to create a room for my project, however the address field becomes red and I cannot click "Create"
[2020-01-23 13:29:21] <psprint> Why?
[2020-01-23 14:02:21] <viktomas> psprint: There is most likely a conflict between the name you've chosen and existing GitHub org or user. We have fix for that waiting to be deployed in a pipelinegitlab-org/gitter/webapp!1735
[2020-01-23 14:03:33] <psprint> viktomas: The conflict would be weird, as I'm the owner of the project (my github org zdharma is)
[2020-01-23 14:08:05] <psprint> tne project is zinit
[2020-01-23 15:04:11] <viktomas> psprint: The information that you are member ofzdharmais not public, so you have to give Gitter access to the more detailed OAuth scopes [<-LINK->] 
[2020-01-23 15:05:14] <psprint> viktomas: I
[2020-01-23 15:05:40] <psprint> I've gave a few grants and I can see the repository in the project-selection dialog
[2020-01-23 15:07:57] <psprint> viktomas:  [<-LINK->] 
[2020-01-23 15:09:13] <viktomas> psprint: ok, you did everything right in that regard.. so the issue is when you are trying to create a room? What community you are creating the room in?
[2020-01-23 15:12:03] <psprint> viktomas: the community name is:zinit
[2020-01-23 15:13:01] <psprint>  [<-LINK->] 
[2020-01-23 15:13:45] <viktomas> I'm afraid that it's in conflict with [<-LINK->] 
[2020-01-23 15:14:25] <viktomas> psprint: could you create a communityzdharmaand a roomzinit?
[2020-01-23 15:15:36] <viktomas> the resulting URL path is going to be same as GitHub repo URL pathzdharma/zinit
[2020-01-23 15:18:32] <psprint> ahso, I see, so that's the difference between community and a room, got it!
[2020-01-23 15:19:09] <psprint> but I could have azinitcommunity just for the project if not the conflict?
[2020-01-23 15:20:19] <viktomas> yes, but you would still need to create rooms inside (e.g.zinit/feature-requestszinit/teamand so on). Community is like a namespace for rooms :)
[2020-01-23 15:21:56] <viktomas> psprint: Docs: [<-LINK->] , it can be also useful for managing admin rights to all rooms within
[2020-01-23 15:22:07] <psprint> ahso. I've indeed had azplugin/Lobbycommunity/room before renaming the repo fromzplugintozinit, so it appears to be not a loss
[2020-01-23 15:22:55] <psprint> or is theLobbyroom an "implicit" one, skipped from the room name?
[2020-01-23 15:24:02] <viktomas> psprint: Lobbyused to be the name for default room that's created when you create a community
[2020-01-23 15:25:47] <psprint> Ahso. I wonder howpureormkdocs-materialcan appear without the owning organization/community ? So didzplugin
[2020-01-23 15:29:14] <viktomas> @psprintI've indeed had a zplugin/Lobby community/room before renaming the repo from zplugin to zinit, so it appears to be not a lossWe can rename the original room for you if you'd like to keep the history. Please look at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/faq.md#what-happens-if-i-rename-something-on-github-org-repo
[2020-01-23 15:43:25] <psprint> thanks!howpurecan appear as single word without a namespace?
[2020-01-23 15:48:12] <psprint> I've sent the rename request :)
[2020-01-23 16:00:34] <Redsandro> The endpoint that provides the "actions" integration, is it protected by authentication for private rooms, or is it always publicly available somewhere when you know the id?
[2020-01-23 19:34:41] <MadLittleMods> Redsandro: If you know the webhook URL, you can send events for the private room. You can track this issue for adding a secret key, [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-01-23 19:36:03] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] Those are the "implicit" default room names when you create a community
[2020-01-24 17:04:14] <thuhoom_twitter> have a quick question, how many gitter chatrooms can one person make for their organization?
[2020-01-24 17:07:10] <thuhoom_twitter> wait nevermind it looks like its boundless?!?
[2020-01-24 17:07:17] <thuhoom_twitter> hhaha amazing!
[2020-01-24 18:14:51] <MadLittleMods> thuhoom_twitter: Yep, there are no limits
[2020-01-26 03:29:04] <anonymouXnash> how can i use enter(as in enter new line when typing) without actually sending the message
[2020-01-26 03:32:06] <anonymouXnash> and how can i use CLI like thisin dark mode
[2020-01-26 05:44:45] <MadLittleMods> anonymouXnash: See [<-LINK->] 
[2020-01-26 06:13:40] <MadLittleMods> anonymouXnash: I'm not sure what you mean by the second question. Can you restate it another way?
[2020-01-26 21:54:56] <jchwenger> pksunkara: I am new to Gitter, and I mistakenly added people thinking those were rooms. When I type\leavein those contexts it simply adds a message saying "\leave", and I cannot find any option to leave the room. That also does not appear when I click on settings. I also could not find any docs on this, thanks for any help!
[2020-01-27 00:09:01] <MarkoShiva> getting "This site can’t be reached" in desktop client of gitter :(
[2020-01-27 00:15:22] <MarkoShiva> I will reinstall
[2020-01-27 00:21:03] <MarkoShiva> again getting the error with default version of gitter available on archlinux [<-CODE->] 
[2020-01-27 00:25:51] <MarkoShiva> so the flatpak package is broken. And Arch don't have a easy way of deploying new version of gitter from git.
[2020-01-27 00:27:15] <MarkoShiva> Can someone tell me is it possible to build a gitter from gitlab project sources that will have gitter.im as a server and use the same simple oauth way to login and auth.
[2020-01-27 03:48:59] <MarkoShiva> anyway will try to see if I can package the gitter-git into arch package.
[2020-01-27 03:50:46] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @jchwengerYou can only hide a one to one room, see [<-LINK->] 
[2020-01-27 03:52:15] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @MarkoShivaIf you build the development version, it will use gitter.im, [<-LINK->] 
[2020-01-27 03:52:52] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @MarkoShivaFor the font issue in the desktop app, you can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-01-27 11:00:07] <jchwenger> MadLittleMods: thanks for this! A shame btw this option does not seem to exist on mobile, it would be nice as well. Cheers!
[2020-01-27 17:45:14] <MadLittleMods> @jchwenger I see the option on mobile web, https://i.imgur.com/BnSbtaW.pngFor the Android app, you can track gitlab-org/gitter/gitter-android-app#94 (iOS issue)
[2020-01-27 18:53:02] <jchwenger> MadLittleMods: thanks for this! All clear.
[2020-01-28 16:13:17] <Dorus> What can we do about room spam? We got this guy spamming a bunch of links to his spam site every 3 weeks, i've reported him last time but he's back now so i'm not sure if report button does much.
[2020-01-28 17:15:17] <grazianocastellano> Hi guys, i' m using gitter api python, so i'm asking if there is any time limit between two requests
[2020-01-28 18:31:20] <viktomas> Dorus: The report button works only if enough people pressed it. If you are the admin of the room, u can use the/bancommand by typing/ban @usernameas a message
[2020-01-28 18:33:46] <viktomas> grazianocastellano: there is a limit on requests to API ( [<-LINK->] )
[2020-01-28 18:38:24] <grazianocastellano> thanks
[2020-01-30 21:43:07] <tjohnson4> Leaving rooms is broken. Is there a trick for it to work? I was scared to join this room cause now it will be stuck on my sidebar. [<-CODE->] 
[2020-01-30 21:44:23] <MadLittleMods> @tjohnson4 What's broken about it? What are you seeing? Just tested in Chrome and I am able to leave roomsDocs: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/rooms.md#leave-a-room
[2020-01-30 21:47:55] <tjohnson4> I have attempted to leave 6 different rooms from the sidebar with the following steps [<-CODE->] Results:Menu closes and room still exists. Also the room moves up in the sidebar
[2020-01-30 21:48:38] <tjohnson4> Uh ya, thanks for the instructions but didn't help
[2020-01-30 21:49:16] <MadLittleMods> tjohnson4: Do you see any error in the devtools console when you click leave?
[2020-01-30 21:58:21] <tjohnson4> There was many errors in the console when I opened it. Refreshed and did  not keep the logs and feature is working now
[2020-01-30 21:58:25] <tjohnson4> nvm
[2020-01-30 22:15:28] <MadLittleMods> tjohnson4: If you can reproduce in the future and see an error, feel free to create an issue, [<-LINK->] 
[2020-01-30 22:15:54] <tjohnson4> will do, thanks

[2020-02-04 21:13:09] <aucampia> can I somehow delete a community?
[2020-02-04 21:13:25] <aucampia> I want to link my community to a github org by same name
[2020-02-04 21:13:36] <aucampia> but I only made the org after making the community
[2020-02-04 22:49:45] <MadLittleMods> aucampia: It's not possible to delete a community in the UI. You can send a message tosupport@gitter.imand we can delete it, [<-LINK->] 
[2020-02-04 22:50:30] <MadLittleMods> aucampia: I see your [<-LINK->] , will look at it now
[2020-02-05 08:05:07] <aucampia> thanks@MadLittleMods
[2020-02-05 19:11:19] <TonyGravagno> I've been reading docs and googling with no joy. I have multiple accounts in GitHub and Twitter.1) Can we login to a single client app with more than one account simultaneously, without logging out of one to login to another?2) Or, can we run multiple instances of Gitter client apps simultaneously under different accounts?3) Or, can we specify an account at launch without having to login manually with a password each time? Then the pattern would be to launch with account1, close, launch for account2, etc..I can work with code to create a solution if required. I'm just not yet aware of details related to maintaining separate OAuth tokens, or if there are existing utilities for swapping environment settings, etc. Thanks!
[2020-02-05 19:25:27] <MadLittleMods> @TonyGravagno There isn't a way to sign in with multiple accounts simultaneously in the UI. Feel free to create an issue, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issuesIf you're using a browser, you can just use multiple browser instances(Chrome profiles for example) or separate browsers.If you're using desktop, pretty sure you could run both the production version and the development version [<-CODE->] 
[2020-02-05 19:27:25] <TonyGravagno> Good leads. I'll follow them. Thank you very much, Eric!
[2020-02-09 19:15:39] <MadLittleMods> Abhishe63449874_twitter: You can use [<-LINK->] . This room is for support for Gitter, the chat app itself, not general technical support
[2020-02-10 09:46:36] <serapath>  [<-CODE->] If I add a github integration for a repository twice, will the activity be reported twice?
[2020-02-10 09:47:04] <serapath> should i add maybe a github integration for each repo, so rather list like 20 integrations each adding activity notifications for a single repo?
[2020-02-10 10:12:20] <yctn> how can i change my name on gitter?
[2020-02-10 15:26:24] <nahuakang> Hi guys, does anyone know what the color scheme and font style are used in Gitter's markdown display in the chat?
[2020-02-10 16:16:45] <viktomas> @serapathIs there a way to add activity notifications for all github repos in an organisation?I think you could take one webhook (created when you create a manual Gitter integration with GitHub) and add it to all repositories that you'd like to listen on. I haven't tried it but I think it should work.If I add a github integration for a repository twice, will the activity be reported twice?I think so, yes.should i add maybe a github integration for each repo, so rather list like 20 integrations each adding activity notifications for a single repo?If I understand the question correctly, you are asking whether to use one Gitter webhook(integration) for all your repositories or one webhook for each repository. I would recommend the latter, but both should work.
[2020-02-10 16:19:40] <viktomas> yctn: your username reflects your GitHub username. If you change your GitHub username, we'll refresh your Gitter username next time you sign in to Gitter. [<-LINK->] (same applies for your full name)
[2020-02-10 16:29:44] <viktomas> nahuakang: A few basic CSS rules are in [<-LINK->] . However, AFAIK Gitter doesn't have a single file where all chat-markdown related rules would be stored. For example the code block styling is in [<-LINK->] 
[2020-02-10 16:33:20] <nahuakang> viktomas: Thank you Thomas!
[2020-02-10 17:56:18] <MadLittleMods>  February 10, 2020 3:46 AM @serapath You can track gitlab-org/gitter/services#35We have some documentation for setting up an integration for a GitHub org manaully: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-/blob/develop/docs/integrations.md#per-organisation

[2020-02-12 09:36:05] <Biswa96> In Chromium, gitter does not scroll down to last message automatically. I have to press page-down button to see the latest one. Is this an issue?
[2020-02-12 09:47:13] <viktomas> Biswa96: Could  please you describe your use case in more detail? When I open a room, the message feed is scrolled to the last message.
[2020-02-12 10:12:06] <Biswa96> Just using Chromium, open gitter.im, that's all.
[2020-02-12 10:29:53] <Biswa96> Though it happens sometimes, not consistently.
[2020-02-12 17:44:30] <nafg> Same here
[2020-02-12 18:35:52] <MadLittleMods> Biswa96: @nafgThere is related issue for this, [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-02-12 18:53:46] <Biswa96> OMG! "Opened 4 years ago". When will it be fixed? Any workaround? JS magic? :)
[2020-02-12 19:40:10] <SDRausty_twitter> OMG! "Opened 4 years ago".
[2020-02-12 19:40:55] <SDRausty_twitter> what has happened?
[2020-02-12 19:58:27] <MadLittleMods> Biswa96: The issue was little different back then. The issue now has a similar symptom so we could use it to track the problem. If you want to create a new issue, feel free
[2020-02-12 20:05:30] <Biswa96> Just kidding... Hope it'll be fixed soon... Thank you!

[2020-02-12 21:34:56] <MadLittleMods> nafg: We're making [<-LINK->] but user-facing can feel slow. Just two of us maintaining things nowadays
[2020-02-13 03:13:35] <nafg> why only 2 people
[2020-02-13 03:14:18] <nafg> full time?
[2020-02-13 03:14:31] <nafg> i'm only 1 person and I maintain a system that's a lot more complex and development isn't that slow
[2020-02-13 08:58:50] <MadLittleMods> nafg: Yes, full time. It's the headcount that fits in the overall GitLab budget given the current plan. It all depends what we're working on
[2020-02-13 17:01:03] <SDRausty_twitter> MadLittleMods: how can develope, "budget given the current plan" online?
[2020-02-13 17:02:09] <SDRausty_twitter> i am very ignorant in the topic of monitization; advice is welcome
[2020-02-13 17:24:19] <nafg> SDRausty_twitter: can you rephrase the question in better english, it's not clear
[2020-02-13 19:44:23] <viktomas> SDRausty_twitter: :@MadLittleModswas just saying that GitLab plans for many initiatives (that Gitter is one of) that require people and resources.
[2020-02-14 09:55:40] <hakril> Hello, I am new to gitter and wanted to create a comunity for a projet of mine. I have been a little to quick and have created a comunity not linked to the associated github projet. What are the consequences ? can I link it after the creation of the comunity ?
[2020-02-14 10:11:30] <viktomas> hakril: the easiest is probably to let us delete the community and re-create it. Can you send details tosupport@gitter.im? I'll get right on it.
[2020-02-14 10:21:24] <hakril> okay ! will do, thank you
[2020-02-14 10:41:31] <hakril> viktomas: I have send the details as requested. thank you for your help.

[2020-02-14 11:16:41] <cbj4074> I'm seeing a lot of this lately. ^ Anybody else?
[2020-02-14 11:16:57] <cbj4074> (on two different machines, which are on two different and unrelated networks)
[2020-02-14 11:39:27] <viktomas> Thank you@cbj4074, I saw this issue briefly last night. I've created an issue for the suspected cause: [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-02-14 11:41:00] <viktomas> cbj4074: could you please check developer tools if there are some other failing requests  when you get that browser notification? (The dev tools need to be open beforehand though :/ )
[2020-02-14 16:25:15] <bkmdev> FYI, your gitter.im dark theme has a CSS bug that incorrectly colors the channel user count to be invisible:  ie:  rule.right-toolbar-region .remaining-view-button-secondary-textneeds to not exist, I believe
[2020-02-14 18:38:07] <cbj4074> viktomas: Thanks, I've opened Dev Tools and will see what happens. It just happened again, so I doubt I'll have to wait long.
[2020-02-14 19:59:35] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @bkmdevThis is tracked by [<-ISSUE->] . Relevant code is linked if you want to fix it
[2020-02-15 12:57:12] <cbj4074> viktomas: Seems like it might be this: [<-CODE->] 
[2020-02-15 12:57:36] <cbj4074> Seems "legit", but why so often???
[2020-02-15 12:57:51] <cbj4074> I'm on a very stable connection, and as I said, this happens on two different machines at two different locations that have different ISPs.
[2020-02-15 23:31:49] <bkmdev> MadLittleMods: Thanks, glad there's already a ticket for it  Re. a PR, I would if I had more time  , surprised it has been open for 2+ years though 
[2020-02-16 14:09:06] <melvincarvalho> Hi all, someone in our gitter channel pointed out that the web version is using google analytics.  He was wondering if that's new or has always been there?
[2020-02-16 23:37:27] <MadLittleMods> melvincarvalho: It's been there for a very long time, [<-CODE->] 
[2020-02-18 19:19:36] <kallisti5_gitlab> Is irc.gitter.im down?
[2020-02-18 19:39:06] <MadLittleMods> kallisti5_gitlab: No but it does restart quite often (kinda tracked by [<-ISSUE->] ). I was just able to connect

[2020-02-19 11:32:18] <Sispheor> the hide button on private messages is gone?
[2020-02-19 14:35:14] <viktomas> Sispheor: Yes, we simplified the left menu when we moved it to Vue, now the "Hide this room" option is in the private conversation room settings.
[2020-02-19 14:38:56] <Sispheor> Like we used to say, "A user interface is like a joke. If you have to explain it, it’s not that good". Anyway, thanks@viktomas!

[2020-02-20 09:32:20] <klyone> Hello everyone, Is there any mode to change token provided by irc.gitter.im? Thanks in advance
[2020-02-20 11:58:06] <viktomas> klyone: I'm not sure what you meann bymode to change token provided by irc.gitter.im. Could you please expand on that thought? I'm not well versed in IRC terminology.
[2020-02-20 12:44:32] <klyone> viktomas: In order to access to Gitter using IRC, you have to login in the irc.gitter.im. As a result, this web reports a specific token that is used as served password. I wonder if this token can be reseted or changed, just for safety.
[2020-02-20 13:20:30] <viktomas> klyone: There is no official, documented way AFAIK. However, you can invalidate the token by [<-LINK->] and then logging out. That should invalidate the token.
[2020-02-20 14:17:50] <klyone> Thanks a lot,@viktomas. I will try and come back to you with news!
[2020-02-20 14:25:39] <klyone> Hi@viktomasagain. Your trick goes fine. Now, token has been regenerated. Thanks a lot for your help!
[2020-02-21 07:07:49] <viktomas> klyone: you are very welcome, thanks for using Gitter :) If you'd be keen, MR to update the docs is always welcomed

[2020-02-24 05:48:23] <RishabhVerma> hello
[2020-02-24 08:14:38] <Oldes> Unfortunately I must say, that using Gitter in a browser on mobile phone is terrible experience again. The side bar with rooms list is opening too easily and is so annoying. Not mentioning, that when there is a code block in  the chat, one can scroll it to the left, but not to the right anymore, because it is also opening the left side menu. Fix it please. It must be some recent change, because I've had no such a problems before.
[2020-02-24 08:51:25] <viktomas> @Oldes Thanks for taking the time and letting us know. The side bar with rooms list is opening too easily and is so annoying.We've been recently trying to find the right balance and thresholds for opening/closing the left menu gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-!1766 and what you describe is definitely a consequence of those efforts. Would you be interested in creating an issue and describing what would be the desired state for you?Not mentioning, that when there is a code block in the chat, one can scroll it to the left, but not to the right anymore, because it is also opening the left side menuAre you facing the same issue described here: gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#2228 ?
[2020-02-24 09:23:43] <Oldes> viktomas: yes... looks like the same issue. I think that there is no new issue needed.. you just have to find the balance ;-) And disable opening the side menu when scrolling inside the code area. Especially when there is a button available for opening the menu. Which was not there a few months ago (and I complained because of it there too)
[2020-02-24 09:27:01] <Oldes> This is exactly why I came here today: [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-02-24 10:17:44] <viktomas> Oldes: thanks again! I've updated/commented on both [<-ISSUE->] and [<-ISSUE->] . You should be now notified about any updates on those issues 
[2020-02-24 19:17:33] <anders-dc> hi all, I used to login to gitter with github auth. I recently deleted my github account, but forgot to close my gitter account first. I am talking through the IRC gateway at present. Could someone help me close the account and the chat rooms under my user? Thanks!
[2020-02-24 20:46:39] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] Otherwise, I can delete it for you now. Just confirm again
[2020-02-25 00:19:30] <MadLittleMods> anders-dc: You can also send an email tosupport@gitter.imwith the deletion request
[2020-02-25 06:32:12] <anders-dc> Ma
[2020-02-25 06:33:10] <anders-dc> MadLittleMods: thanks, unfortunately I got a 401 with my attempt, so it would be great if you could delete it for me. Thanks!

[2020-02-27 08:24:58] <HenkPoley> I'm getting "Having trouble connecting to gitter.im" notifications.

[2020-02-27 18:56:17] <MadLittleMods> HenkPoley: I don't think it's unique to you. Sounds pretty similar to [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-02-27 21:50:28] <MadLittleMods> HenkPoley: Added a comment with some info, [<-LINK->] 
[2020-02-28 07:17:54] <HenkPoley> MadLittleMods: t=issue can give 404 errors
[2020-02-28 07:19:28] <HenkPoley> Anyways, I'm still getting "Unable to communicate with Gitter" notifications from the gitter.im website
[2020-02-28 08:00:35] <MadLittleMods> HenkPoley: TheUnable to communicate with Gitterwill happen whenever you see the 500 response from theissue-stateendpoint. That issue is tracked by [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-02-28 08:21:58] <HenkPoley> 
[2020-02-28 21:21:05] <dstaley> hello! interesting little situation I seem to have created for myself: I was attempting to add an org-level github integration to a room, but I mistakenly authorized the integration via the automatic method. I thought I could just revoke the access and try again, but now anytime I try to add the github integration I get the error that "GitHub did something weird".
[2020-02-28 21:27:34] <MadLittleMods> @dstaley You could setup the integration manually: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/2084#workaround [<-CODE->] 
[2020-02-28 21:28:01] <dstaley> I did revoke that one, ya. Lemme sign out and see if that works!
[2020-02-28 21:28:56] <dstaley> Nope, that doesn't seem to have fixed it.
[2020-02-28 21:30:39] <dstaley> When I get that error, it looks like Gitter is still provisioning a token. Should I manually create the webhook with that token, or should I just wait until we figure out what's going on?
[2020-02-28 21:37:29] <MadLittleMods> dstaley: You can manually create the integration. It won't affect the setup later after we figure this out. TheGitter WebhooksOAuth app is just for listing all of your repos so you can choose what projects you want to see events from
[2020-02-28 21:40:21] <dstaley> Alrighty, sounds good! Just as a heads up though, I can't get to the setup manually UI. I have to try to add GitHub, get the error, close the modal, open it again, and then it has the webhook endpoint and token listed
[2020-02-28 21:40:28] <dstaley> just in case that's relevant!
[2020-02-28 21:40:50] <dstaley> I, uh, take that back? I just tried it again and it's now asking me to authorize github
[2020-02-28 21:55:03] <MadLittleMods> @dstaley Is it working now? [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] So I'm confused in what situation either is used. [<-CODE->] 
[2020-02-28 21:58:07] <MadLittleMods> dstaley: All of that stuff is session stored so if you clear your cookies forwebhooks.gitter.im, things should reset
[2020-02-29 14:45:53] <egil> hey gitter support, can you help me rename my gitter channel ( [<-LINK->] My library changed name to bunit. So can I change the name to [<-LINK->] 
[2020-03-01 16:17:56] <buzzsurfr> I'm trying to create a community/room for buzzsurfr/cloudkey (my repo, no org) but when I do, I get an error.I'm clicking the '+' then Create Community, selecting to create from a repo instead, and selecting the repo. My error message is:The name of the GitHub repo you selected conflicts with the name of a GitHub org/user. When you select the a repo "buzzsurfr/cloudkey", it fills out the community URI as "cloudkey" which clashes another GitHub org/user. Change your community URI to proceed.
[2020-03-01 16:19:03] <buzzsurfr> I'm not following the logic on this error message--it is because github has a user named "cloudkey"? If so, can I create a community for my name then add "cloudkey" as a room?
[2020-03-02 00:20:20] <MadLittleMods> @buzzsurfr Your understanding is correct. https://github.com/cloudkey exists so you can't create a Gitter community with the same name (unless you sign in as that user) [<-CODE->] 
[2020-03-02 00:21:42] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @egilPlease send an email tosupport@gitter.imwith these same details
[2020-03-02 01:45:17] <buzzsurfr> MadLittleMods: I just tried to create the community “buzzsurfr” and got message:
[2020-03-02 01:45:24] <buzzsurfr> This address is not available. It already exists on Gitter
[2020-03-02 06:09:07] <MadLittleMods> @buzzsurfr I'm also seeing the same issue testing this out locally. I created gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#2462 to track the issue.I've manually created the community and dummy room which you can join and create your actually desired room, https://gitter.im/buzzsurfr/community
[2020-03-03 14:08:46] <dbarnett> I've reported spam messages in the google/vim room, but the menu just disappeared when I clicked "Report". I didn't see any acknowledgement that it was successfully reported, and the messages are still there days later. Is that expected?
[2020-03-03 14:09:21] <dbarnett> I read [<-LINK->] . It says the basics but nothing about what happens after I click "Report"
[2020-03-03 17:20:31] <dstaley> What exactly does the "Add" button on the "Getting Started: Spread the Word" dialog do?
[2020-03-03 23:58:15] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @dstaleyThere is no feedback after you click but it should have gone through no problem. Feel free to create an issue about adding some feedback for that request or a merge request to update the docs about that area of ambiguity, [<-LINK->] 
[2020-03-03 23:59:29] <MadLittleMods> @dstaley It will add/invite that person to the room,
[2020-03-04 00:17:22] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] Any others spammers I should take care of?
[2020-03-04 00:32:00] <dstaley> dbarnett: I believe these are for you ^
[2020-03-04 00:32:34] <MadLittleMods> Thanks@dstaley
[2020-03-04 00:34:00] <dstaley> Does inviting someone to a room send them an email or anything? Just trying to determine if sending an invite would be an annoyance to org members
[2020-03-04 00:34:38] <MadLittleMods> dstaley: Yes, if we have their email available from GitHub, it will send an email about your invite
[2020-03-04 00:36:12] <MadLittleMods> dstaley: If we don't have their email available, it will ask you to input their email
[2020-03-04 00:36:55] <dstaley> Ah okay, thanks for clarifying!
[2020-03-04 00:38:58] <dbarnett> MadLittleMods: how about my question above on the "Report" mechanism. do you know how that's supposed to work?
[2020-03-04 00:45:09] <MadLittleMods> dbarnett: Replied to it just above  [<-LINK->] 
[2020-03-04 00:45:21] <MadLittleMods> Sorry for the wrong mention so it's not obvious
[2020-03-05 15:32:39] <proxypanther> Hi. The Gitter logo on the menu doesn't have a click action. It doesn't take me to the home page on desktop. Is that intentional?
[2020-03-05 20:22:10] <MadLittleMods> @proxypanther There is no link there right now but you could submit a merge request to add one: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-/blob/4ace29184147e1690a88dfd0ece42ef23f992c9f/public/js/vue/left-menu/components/index.vue#L88-104We can link to https://gitter.im/?redirect=no [<-CODE->] 
[2020-03-06 10:29:01] <viktomas> We had an outage thanks to our redis cluster. We'll make all information available in [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-03-06 16:20:47] <JustinTArthur> Having an issues with navigation between rooms on both web app and desktop shell. First room visited and participants remain despite header bar and URL changing to next room clicked. The bayeaux WebSocket is also timing out occasionally or returning a gateway error from its reverse proxy.
[2020-03-06 17:35:36] <GrahamDi> I am experiencing issues with the gitter app. Many rooms / conversations don't show the input area at the bottom of the screen. I can't send messages, only see what is there already. Is there a problem?
[2020-03-06 17:36:55] <GrahamDi> Now it's working again, would appreciate your view on the problem though.
[2020-03-07 00:06:22] <MadLittleMods> GrahamDi: Which app are you using (Android, iOS, desktop)? Not aware of a problem that would hide the textarea input. There is a problem with realtime messages not going through at the moment: [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-03-07 00:06:35] <MadLittleMods> JustinTArthur: See [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-03-07 01:12:28] <JustinTArthur> MadLittleMods: the issues persisted past the redis restart, FWIW
[2020-03-07 02:09:25] <MadLittleMods> JustinTArthur: I'm currently looking into making larger Redis instances: [<-LINK->] 
[2020-03-07 02:54:42] <JustinTArthur> Thanks,@MadLittleMods. Good luck!
[2020-03-07 06:50:16] <GrahamDi> MadLittleMods: I use the android app and the desktop on win10. Desktop no problems but the app wasn't showing the input area at times yesterday. Was also random when switching between channels, sometimes it showed sometimes not. Seems fine now. Thanks for getting back to me.
[2020-03-07 08:42:38] <wsdjeg> hello, does gitter team change it's develop API?
[2020-03-07 08:43:15] <wsdjeg> I use a project to bridged message between gitter and irc, but it can not handle gitter message now!!
[2020-03-07 08:44:29] <MadLittleMods> wsdjeg: We're still seeing the realtime message problem but I think we just got to the bottom of it (services weren't actually restarted), [<-LINK->] 
[2020-03-07 08:46:00] <wsdjeg> MadLittleMods: Thanks, so it is not issue with the bridged tools but the gitter server?
[2020-03-07 08:48:59] <MadLittleMods> wsdjeg: Correct, problem with Gitter server right now
[2020-03-08 19:40:46] <viktomas> ferasj22: For general developer conversation please use [<-LINK->] . This room is for support of Gitter.im itself.
[2020-03-09 08:14:18] <hsluoyz> Hi, when can we support threads? I saw Slack already has this feature. We are an open-source project, and we want to use Gitter as a mailing list than an IM. But no-thread support blocks us.
[2020-03-09 08:16:31] <viktomas> hsluoyz: Threaded conversations are in beta [<-LINK->] 
[2020-03-09 08:18:18] <viktomas> Currently, we are working on [<-ISSUE->] with threaded conversations support and after that we are going to move threads out of beta and make them available in every room
[2020-03-09 08:19:52] <hsluoyz> Thanks for this great feature! I enabled it in my room and it looks great!!
[2020-03-09 08:23:59] <viktomas> hsluoyz: I'm super pleased to hear that.   This is the epic for threaded conversations [<-LINK->] . If you'd like to create an issue/suggestion in our issue tracker, please first look there for existing issues. :slight_smile:
[2020-03-09 09:00:35] <hsluoyz> Thanks!
[2020-03-09 21:34:53] <dstaley> viktomas: I thought the mobile apps were deprecated?
[2020-03-10 10:15:17] <viktomas> @dstaley We aren't actively supporting the mobile apps, and we do plan to deprecated them in the future. gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#2281There is still significant (~5%) amount of users using the mobile apps and before our Progressive Web App doesn't support notifications well, we'll try not to completely break the mobile apps (which is what we would do with the threaded message release)
[2020-03-10 17:49:37] <drstevens> I'm having some difficulty controlling email notificationsI have read this and I believe I have things configured correctly.https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-/blob/develop/docs/notifications.mdI have defaults to "Announcements..." and have forced all the conversations I'm in to use these, but yet I still get many emails a day which don't include announcements or mentions. A coworker has confirmed his frustration with the emails. Is there something we are doing wrong here?
[2020-03-10 18:07:14] <drstevens> Do email notifications not use this configuration? Are they simply on for all messages or off?
[2020-03-11 07:58:47] <viktomas> drstevens: You've run into an existing issue [<-ISSUE->] We have a community contribution to at least better explain what users can expectgitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-!1785and we are planning to fix our notifications in the future.
[2020-03-11 11:07:24] <drstevens> Is this new behavior? It feels like I've been experiencing this for years, but finally got aggravated enough yesterday to reach out. I'm surprised to see this issue only two weeks old.
[2020-03-11 11:11:29] <drstevens> It would be helpful if you clarify this in the documentation here as well [<-LINK->] 
[2020-03-11 14:07:54] <viktomas> drstevens: The underlying issue is much older: [<-ISSUE->] The documentation mentions the issue. But there might be a more obvious phrasing [<-LINK->] 
[2020-03-11 15:26:31] <drstevens> The phrasing works. I must have just missed it when I skimmed yesterday. It seems like this is isolated to email notifications? Perhaps copy this not to the email part? Make the font red?
[2020-03-12 03:42:28] <amosbird> Is there any plan to create a native destkop application of giiter?
[2020-03-12 10:45:26] <f5k_gitlab> Hi, does anybody know if there is any documentation about irc.gitter.im anywhere? In particular, how the channel name mapping is done?
[2020-03-12 13:03:39] <viktomas>  [<-LINK->] @f5k_gitlabThe readme doesn't specifically mention channel name mapping, but the code is just a few hundred lines of JS: [<-LINK->] 
[2020-03-12 13:04:40] <f5k_gitlab> viktomas: , thanks, I forgot to follow up, but I think I found it out. :-)
[2020-03-12 13:05:15] <viktomas>  [<-LINK->] @amosbirThere are existing apps [<-LINK->] we haven't released an update to them in over a year though. Any contributions are welcomed
[2020-03-12 13:05:26] <f5k_gitlab> or, I was automatically joined to the IRC channel representations by joining them in the web UI
[2020-03-12 16:54:26] <viktomas> f5k_gitlab: yes, there isn't any difference between the IRC channel and Gitter room

[2020-03-15 15:02:20] <jasonblum> Hi I accidentally deleted a community and now I can't create it because the community-uri is taken (tho I highly doubt someone else created it in the seconds it took for me to relalize my error)
[2020-03-16 17:26:12] <filipesaraiva_gitlab> jasonblum: I have the same problem :( gitter.im/ccsl-ufpa. Please, could someone remove that orphaned community for me?
[2020-03-16 18:05:25] <MadLittleMods> @jasonblum What's the URI for the community you are trying to create? I can clean things up for you. It's not possible to delete a community so it still exists but without any rooms, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-/blob/develop/docs/communities.md#delete-a-community@filipesaraiva_gitlab https://gitter.im/ccsl-ufpa is now deleted 
[2020-03-16 19:00:19] <jasonblum> MadLittleMods: ah thanks ok its [<-LINK->] 
[2020-03-16 22:20:02] <MadLittleMods> jasonblum:  [<-LINK->] has been deleted 
[2020-03-17 09:58:15] <jasonblum> MadLittleMods: thanks but I am still unable to recreate it: "This address is not available. It already exists on Gitter."
[2020-03-17 14:11:23] <MadLittleMods> @jasonblum The community does not exist on Gitter anymore (just checked the database). When I try to create the community I get the following error. But that is because I don't have access to https://github.com/pythoneers. If you're seeing the same error, you can run through these steps: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-/blob/develop/docs/faq.md#why-isnt-my-github-organisation-or-repos-appearingThere is a URI clash with an org/repo/user on GitHub. Change your community URI to proceed or if you in control of this org/repo, allow private repo access on the GitHub org or make your org membership public. We are currently not allowed to see that you control the GitHub org/repo
[2020-03-17 16:31:56] <jasonblum> MadLittleMods: ah totally forgot abotu the repo.  ok fixed now.  Thanks!

[2020-03-19 18:06:46] <vyachkonovalov> MadLittleMods: ok, will do, thank you
[2020-03-19 18:07:04] <MadLittleMods> vyachkonovalov: As a workaround, if you want a token to use for the IRC bridge, you can sign in on [<-LINK->] and use the personal access token there
[2020-03-19 18:08:05] <vyachkonovalov> oh, that's good
[2020-03-19 18:30:10] <MadLittleMods> Thanks for the issue@vyachkonovalov, I'll look at it today, [<-ISSUE->]

[2020-03-20 19:44:22] <icarusz> Hi, I have a public repo for an organization of which I am a member but I cant seem to get gitter to let me make it into a community
[2020-03-20 19:45:48] <icarusz> It rightly says dgit is asscoiated with "Associated withquorumcontrol/dgit”
[2020-03-20 19:46:07] <icarusz> but i am one of the owners of quorumcontrol and i have made that fact public
[2020-03-20 23:44:49] <MadLittleMods> @icarusz What is the exact error you are seeing?You can try running through https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-/blob/develop/docs/faq.md#why-isnt-my-github-organisation-or-repos-appearing but it sounds like you already have it associated

[2020-03-24 16:19:33] <masonwheeler> Hi, we've got a guy in what's supposed to be a room for a civil discussion of a software project, ranting about politics, calling people Nazis, and refusing to stop after being asked to leave politics out of the room multiple times.  Where can I find a mod to throw this guy out?
[2020-03-24 16:27:04] <viktomas> masonwheeler: Room admins can ban the user (which will forever kick them out of the room). If the behaviour is abusive, please contactsupport@gitter.im(please add links to the messages) and we can ban the user from Gitter itself.
[2020-03-24 16:28:32] <masonwheeler> How do you get a link to a post?  I know there's a way but I can't find the option in the UI for it
[2020-03-24 16:30:11] <viktomas> masonwheeler: You can click on the message timestamp which changes the browser address bar,alt+click will add the permalink to the message input box
[2020-03-24 16:31:00] <viktomas> (more info in Gitter docs [<-LINK->] )
[2020-03-24 16:31:13] <masonwheeler> Thanks!  OK, how abusive would you consider [<-LINK->] (Most recent incident, but by no means the only one, from this guy.)
[2020-03-24 16:34:49] <viktomas> masonwheeler: Please let's continue through the support email (that creates a Zendesk ticket we can act on)
[2020-03-24 16:35:26] <masonwheeler> sure
[2020-03-24 16:45:54] <tleylan> how do we report@masonwheeler? I'm not the person he is referring to but mason wheeler is calling everybody trolls (repeatedly) and nothing we ask makes him stop.
[2020-03-24 16:47:47] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] For general spam/abuse you can use the report message feature built into the UI, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-/blob/develop/docs/messages.md#report-messages
[2020-03-24 16:49:56] <masonwheeler> Oh, for heaven's sake! I'm trying to deal with a legitimate problem in our room, and one of his friends shows up and retaliates by trying to make it look like I'm the problem?!?
[2020-03-24 16:52:22] <tleylan> MadLittleMods: Thanks I will look into it. There are several hundred of us that chat every day and one guy keeps calling all of us trolls. The person calling the members of the room "trolls" may not be the problem but how can everyone but that one person be a troll?
[2020-03-24 16:54:16] <masonwheeler> That is a flat-out lie, and if you report it they'll see you're lying through your teeth.  I calledtwopeople trolls, for trolling behavior that's disrupting the hundreds of the rest of us in the room who are trying to talk about the actual purpose of the room!
[2020-03-24 16:54:54] <MadLittleMods> tleylan: @masonwheelerLet's handle it in Zendesk tickets,support@gitter.im
[2020-03-24 16:55:40] <masonwheeler> Fine with me.
[2020-03-24 16:55:40] <tleylan> Thanks@MadLittleModsyou can see what we're up against.
[2020-03-24 20:36:55] <kaddkaka> Hi, when I enter [<-LINK->] I get redirected to my latest visited channel/conversation, which is a bit confusing when trying to understand what gitter is the first time you find it. Does gitter have a homepage?
[2020-03-24 21:12:06] <MadLittleMods> kaddkaka: You can use [<-LINK->] 
[2020-03-24 21:15:21] <kaddkaka> Thanks@MadLittleModsthat's not anything I would have guessed :)
[2020-03-24 21:22:44] <MadLittleMods> kaddkaka: We could link the logo and "Gitter" text in the top-left. Feel free to create an issue or merge request to update it. The relevant code is in [<-CODE->] 
[2020-03-24 21:30:50] <kaddkaka> MadLittleMods: Is it possible to do a merge request without cloning the repo?
[2020-03-24 23:08:52] <MadLittleMods> kaddkaka: You can use the Web IDE in GitLab but you won't be able to test your change [<-LINK->] 
[2020-03-24 23:09:09] <MadLittleMods> Sorry for the late responses, I'm moving this week
[2020-03-25 07:00:40] <kaddkaka> MadLittleMods: No problem, Can I also create a branch with the Web GUI somehow?
[2020-03-25 07:03:52] <kaddkaka> Perhaps I don't have access to create a new branch if I just created a gitlab account?
[2020-03-25 07:05:46] <MadLittleMods> kaddkaka: If you sign in, when you try to edit a file, it will fork it to your own namespace and it will create a branch with your edit
[2020-03-25 08:43:04] <viktomas> benet585_gitlab: Is the question related to Gitter? If not, please use [<-LINK->] . This room is for support of Gitter.im itself.
[2020-03-26 08:42:07] <kaddkaka> Hi I'm trying to edit a file related to gitter in the gitlab. I am signed in. But the "WEB IDE" button on the top is disabled with a note saying "you can only edit a file when you are on a branch". Can I create a branhc in the web gui?
[2020-03-26 08:42:28] <kaddkaka> related to@MadLittleModsreply: " If you sign in, when you try to edit a file, it will fork it to your own namespace and it will create a branch with your edit"
[2020-03-26 08:42:48] <kaddkaka> I'm trying to modify this piece of code: [<-LINK->] 
[2020-03-26 08:45:22] <viktomas> kaddkaka: You can just replace the commit hash in the URL with a branch (e.g.develop) [<-LINK->] WebIDE should let you to commit the changes to a different branch after you make them.
[2020-03-26 08:46:18] <kaddkaka> "You're not allowed to edit files in this project directly. Please fork this project, make your changes there, and submit a merge request." So I need to fork it?
[2020-03-26 08:52:38] <viktomas> kaddkaka: yes you do
[2020-03-26 08:53:07] <kaddkaka> Oh, cumbersome
[2020-03-27 20:06:55] <master117> How can I actually delete my account and not just turn it into a ghost, which should be possible according to GDPR? Where can I request all information concerning me in accordance with GDPR?
[2020-03-27 20:29:20] <Abdelmottaleb> Abdelmottaleb: Hello every, I have this WRN in my log displayed hundreds of times and then the program end up with exceptionWARN  [ c.a.j.AbstractConnectionProxy] - logWarning: Forcing close of pending statement:oracle.jdbc.driver.OraclePreparedStatementWrapper@1b5ff5c0have you any idea please?
[2020-03-27 22:11:52] <MadLittleMods>  March 27, 2020 3:06 PM @master117 You can only turn your account into a ghost to anonymize the messages. Related issue: gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-#1938For export you can track gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-#1899 but we can handle it manually via support@gitter.im
[2020-03-27 22:13:20] <MadLittleMods>  March 27, 2020 3:29 PM @Abdelmottaleb This is support for Gitter, the chat app itself. It looks like you are dealing with a Java error and I don't know of a Gitter client that uses Java.For general developer support, you can use https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/developers
[2020-03-28 03:32:40] <cole-wilson> 
[2020-03-28 03:32:59] <cole-wilson> i was wondering if there was a way to make gitter a pwa?
[2020-03-28 03:33:03] <cole-wilson> for mobile
[2020-03-28 03:39:42] <cole-wilson> They are very simple to make, and this would easily convert this web app into a stand alone app for ios/android
[2020-03-28 03:39:45] <cole-wilson> in html
[2020-03-28 03:39:56] <cole-wilson>  [<-LINK->] 
[2020-03-28 20:18:59] <MadLittleMods> cole-wilson: We definately want to get to that point. You can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-03-29 01:06:51] <cole-wilson> Thanks! I'll check that out.
[2020-03-30 13:55:37] <stavlocker> Hello everyone. Is pinning messages possible? Also, is RTL supported here? I have looked through the issues & documentation and couldn't find anything that could help with this topic.Thanks in advance!
[2020-03-30 17:51:40] <MadLittleMods> @stavlocker You can track this issue for pinning/sticky a message: gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-#501RTL languages might be supported (I don't use one so I am not exactly sure). I have seen Arabic used in some cases. There is this bug with RTL: gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-#1477
[2020-03-30 17:54:03] <stavlocker> I blame GitLab's search mechanism. Thanks!The issue about RTL languages isn't quite what I was looking for - when you write a message in an RTL language, it's still LTR.
[2020-03-30 18:19:11] <MadLittleMods> stavlocker: Is RTL support a simple CSS fix? Feel free to create a merge request or issue. Relevant code is here: [<-CODE->] 
[2020-03-30 18:35:39] <stavlocker> MadLittleMods: I'm fairly certain that this fix should be two lines, one in CSS and one in the HTML (or JS actually) - but I don't really have time for the overhead of creating a local working Gitter clone to test it :(
[2020-03-31 00:34:39] <Luke18033> Can the "communities" view in the leftmenu please be brought back? I find it much nicer than having everything grouped into a single list, and I'm not sure why it was removed.
[2020-03-31 04:15:25] <MadLittleMods> @Luke18033 You can track gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-#2210We opted to keep it out out of our first iteration when we transitioned over to Vue.js as it wasn't used that often(according to our stats). But it's still useful and not against having it in a future iteration
[2020-04-01 08:19:53] <truongio> Hi, I am wondering what color theme is it that gitter uses for code blocks: [<-CODE->] 
[2020-04-01 09:48:52] <viktomas> truongio: Looks like it's Monokai. Code is in [<-LINK->] and [<-LINK->] 
[2020-04-01 09:56:56] <ghost~5e845d4cd73408ce4fdec72f> When I signed in using GitHub, I was asked if I wanted to authorize my organization.  I did not do so.  However, the OAuth scopes said that you'd be able to read my organization membership, etc.  So I'm confused about the access you have, now?  Could you please clarify?
[2020-04-01 10:11:52] <viktomas> I would assume that Gitter will have access to see what public organizations are you member of. Our docs on the OAuth scopes: [<-LINK->] . You should be able to double check in your settings page: [<-LINK->] 
[2020-04-01 10:16:23] <ghost~5e845d4cd73408ce4fdec72f> yes, it looks like it does provide access to my org.  That's not okay.  I need to revoke that OAuth grant.  I assume that deleting my account would do so?
[2020-04-01 10:19:47] <MadLittleMods> jar349: You can revoke access viahttps://github.com/organizations/<YOUR ORG>/settings/oauth_application_policyor personally via [<-LINK->] 
[2020-04-01 18:54:02] <uuttff8> Hello, is there a way to mark all messages as read? in a room
[2020-04-01 18:56:13] <uuttff8> or should I send all messagesId that is unread in this  body [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
[2020-04-01 18:57:43] <uuttff8> in this situation, it is good that unread limit is 100
[2020-04-01 19:07:40] <sparr> in the linux desktop client where can I find the "default" that is used to set per-room notifications for new rooms I join?
[2020-04-01 19:08:50] <MadLittleMods> sparr: Go to any room notification settings then clickConfigure defaultin the bottom-left corner,
[2020-04-01 19:09:03] <sparr> Thank you, I looked literally everywhere else after overlooking that
[2020-04-01 19:09:30] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @uuttff8There isDELETE /v1/user/:userId/rooms/:roomId/unreadItems/all
[2020-04-01 19:09:36] <uuttff8> wow
[2020-04-01 19:09:43] <sparr> In the "All Conversations" list on the left, can I rename things there? Or, why do some show the "server"/room and others just the name of the room?
[2020-04-01 19:09:51] <uuttff8> that is undocumented, btw
[2020-04-01 19:10:26] <sparr> "gitterHQ/gitter" is great, but I have one room just named "General" over there which is really " [<-LINK->] " when I open it and see its full name at the top
[2020-04-01 19:10:30] <MadLittleMods> uuttff8: You can add it to the documentation here: [<-LINK->] 
[2020-04-01 19:13:07] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] We shorten and truncate the name so it fits in the left-menu better
[2020-04-01 19:14:53] <sparr>  [<-LINK->] 
[2020-04-01 19:48:06] <uuttff8>  [<-LINK->] 
[2020-04-01 19:48:11] <uuttff8> ok, how to get all of that stuff for each user
[2020-04-01 19:49:36] <MadLittleMods> uuttff8: What do you mean? Just fill out the information on GitHub. Then you can hover a users avatar to show the popover
[2020-04-01 19:49:43] <uuttff8>  [<-LINK->] just can't find that here
[2020-04-01 19:50:31] <MadLittleMods> uuttff8: Feel free to send a merge request for this file to add it: [<-LINK->] 
[2020-04-01 19:50:31] <uuttff8> MadLittleMods: I didn't know that this info you get from GitHub, thanks
[2020-04-01 19:52:32] <sparr> now I'm making an arch package for building gitter desktop from git master, so I can more easily hack out that name shortening feature
[2020-04-01 19:53:01] <uuttff8> MadLittleMods: you know, it would be better, yes, but I just don't have experience in js. Ok, can I get info how user signed in? ie, GitHub, gitlab, twitter
[2020-04-01 19:57:45] <MadLittleMods> sparr: I'd be curious to see your solution to add to thewebappitself. Mind creating an issue with your proposal? [<-LINK->] 
[2020-04-01 19:58:08] <sparr> my solution won't be very friendly to other screeen sizes or users
[2020-04-01 19:58:18] <uuttff8>  [<-LINK->] 
[2020-04-01 19:58:23] <uuttff8> MadLittleMods: you already do that, btw
[2020-04-01 19:58:36] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] For GitHub, they have no suffix
[2020-04-01 19:59:21] <MadLittleMods> uuttff8: In the future when you can change your username, this will change though [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-04-01 19:59:24] <uuttff8> that is from web app
[2020-04-01 20:00:11] <MadLittleMods> uuttff8: Let's move to [<-LINK->] for more discussion
[2020-04-01 20:00:32] <uuttff8> MadLittleMods: I don't think this is a problem, my app will always fetch new username
[2020-04-01 20:01:04] <uuttff8> ok, my new questions will be  in [<-LINK->] 
[2020-04-01 20:08:37] <uuttff8> anyone user signed in through not a GitHub? for a test pls
[2020-04-01 20:18:05] <sparr> am I reading this right; to build thedesktopapp I need to also buildwebappfor it to somehow embed?
[2020-04-01 20:25:31] <MadLittleMods> uuttff8: I can test with you, let's move to [<-LINK->] 
[2020-04-01 20:25:42] <MadLittleMods> sparr: Correct, the desktop app is just a wrapper around thewebapp
[2020-04-01 20:28:07] <sparr> What I'm looking for is all the steps required to go from zero to a built gitter desktop client; the same thing I would get from downloading and extractinggitter_VERSION_amd64.deb
[2020-04-01 20:28:19] <sparr> sorry, notification was unclear and I thought what you were saying to uuttff8 was for me at first
[2020-04-01 20:29:50] <MadLittleMods> sparr: If you build [<-LINK->] , that isgitter_VERSION_amd64.deband it points at [<-LINK->] for thewebapp
[2020-04-01 20:30:00] <sparr> oh, drat
[2020-04-01 20:30:22] <MadLittleMods> sparr: If you want to customize the left-menu, you will need to build [<-LINK->] but pointing locally at your own [<-CODE->] ( [<-LINK->] )
[2020-04-01 20:30:22] <sparr> so much for my plan for changing the channel name shortener function locally
[2020-04-01 20:30:55] <sparr> I don't think I want to be running that separately. I take it there's no existing workflow for packaging them together?
[2020-04-01 20:31:06] <MadLittleMods> sparr: See [<-LINK->] 
[2020-04-01 20:32:14] <MadLittleMods> sparr: There is no package in that sense. The desktop app just points at a certain URL. So you can point it at production [<-LINK->] or your local copy [<-LINK->] 
[2020-04-01 20:32:54] <sparr> yeah, I think to make this work I'd need to be able to build both, and write a wrapper that launches the webapp when the desktop client starts, and kill it when it ends
[2020-04-01 20:33:08] <sparr> a little outside the scope of what I'm up for today
[2020-04-01 20:34:13] <MadLittleMods> sparr: Actually thinking about it more, it would be tricky because you still want to access production data, just with your own frontend which isn't really supported for others
[2020-04-01 20:34:40] <sparr> guess I'll just live with the channel list being partially useless :/
[2020-04-01 20:34:44] <MadLittleMods> sparr: We could make this easy though and add the full name as a hidden element in the HTML. Then you could show it with your own custom CSS
[2020-04-01 20:34:55] <sparr> or make it a tooltip
[2020-04-01 20:35:46] <sparr> or, thinking bigger, a discord-like option to group rooms by [what's the word for a gitter "server"?]
[2020-04-01 20:36:09] <MadLittleMods> sparr: Tooltip sounds good! You can add thetitle=""attribute to [<-CODE->] 
[2020-04-01 20:36:16] <sparr> yeah
[2020-04-01 20:36:52] <sparr> I think I'm out of steam for trying to build gitter today. If I end up spending more time on the platform, I'll take another run at this.
[2020-04-01 20:36:53] <MadLittleMods> @sparr A server in our terms would be a "Community".It sounds like you are after the community view which is tracked by gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-#2210
[2020-04-01 20:38:35] <sparr> [how] can I turn off notifications for mentions, for a person or room or globally?
[2020-04-01 20:39:23] <MadLittleMods> sparr: It's not possible to mute a user yet. You can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-04-01 20:39:40] <sparr> thanks. gonna have to log out, then. thanks for the help and guidance.
[2020-04-01 20:39:52] <MadLittleMods> sparr: If someone is harassing you, send an email tosupport@gitter.imwith the details and we can deal with it
[2020-04-01 20:40:19] <MadLittleMods> sparr: You're welcome, have a good evening!
[2020-04-01 20:40:36] <sparr> not harassing. it's you. probably nothing wrong with what you're doing, it just doesn't mesh with my "pay attention to things that beep and flash" workflow.
[2020-04-01 20:41:18] <MadLittleMods> Ahh, can avoid pinging you in our continued conversation then

[2020-04-09 04:15:48] <IOTQQ> Does anybody know how long the files uploaded on gitter are stored, can they be customized and deleted?
[2020-04-09 04:55:19] <MadLittleMods> IOTQQ: Uploads last forever. Deleting the message with the upload, does not delete the upload
[2020-04-09 07:39:09] <IOTQQ> MadLittleMods: thanks
[2020-04-10 07:00:02] <amosbird_gitlab> Hello, is there any reason why gitter doesn't post events when message gets updated or deleted?
[2020-04-10 07:00:12] <amosbird_gitlab> this makes bridging a bit of pain
[2020-04-10 17:21:52] <MadLittleMods> amosbird_gitlab: The [<-LINK->] does sendremoveevents when a message gets deleted. Same for edit andoperation: "update" [<-CODE->] 
[2020-04-10 21:47:44] <sbromberger> hi all. Sorry if this has been asked before, but is there a way to configure the iOS gitter app so that the "return" key on a smart keyboard sends the message?
[2020-04-10 21:48:26] <sbromberger> (I'm trying to convince my open source group to move over from Slack, and this will be one of the pain points.)
[2020-04-10 22:12:03] <sbromberger> also, apparently message threading is available in iOS v4.4.0, but I don't know how to use it.
[2020-04-10 22:16:34] <sbromberger> oh, it looks like the apps are being deprecated. OK. That's a showstopper. Sorry for wasting your time.
[2020-04-10 22:43:14] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] Threads in the mobile apps are supported at a minimum level. You can view the content and it links off to the parent via a link that opens in your browser.
[2020-04-10 22:43:54] <MadLittleMods> sbromberger: There is someone working on a 3rd party iOS client. You might want to track their project ->  [<-LINK->] 
[2020-04-11 00:52:54] <sbromberger> thanks,@EricTroupeTester- I'll check it out.
[2020-04-11 10:41:30] <puremourning> hey@MadLittleModsdo you know why Gitter always requires the discrete GPU on macbook (at least on my macbook) ? I googled and found that there is some chromium blacklist or other that forces use of the discrete GPU with certain GPUs, but tbh, does electronreallyneed hardware acceleration to run gitter ?

[2020-04-11 10:41:43] <puremourning> ms teams is just as bad, as you can see

[2020-04-11 10:42:32] <puremourning> oh maybe not, in feb 2020 they “fixed” it [<-LINK->] 
[2020-04-11 10:46:13] <puremourning> btw, if i visit gitter.im in chrome or safari, it doesn’t use the GPU
[2020-04-11 11:55:13] <W5G> Hello, how's the team going?

[2020-04-13 17:58:26] <MadLittleMods> mjy: You can track the issues in [<-LINK->] for post creation customization
[2020-04-13 18:27:38] <mjy> Thanks much@MadLittleMods
[2020-04-14 08:11:03] <Devqon> Hi, is it not possibly to add newlines (or use compose mode) in threads?
[2020-04-14 11:01:23] <viktomas> Devqon: Not at the moment, there is an issue to track that functionality: [<-ISSUE->]

[2020-04-14 11:52:37] <tizonia> W5G: , I joined Gitter using my GitHub account. So I believe I don't have a personal password. So what else do I need to authenticate with Weechat?

[2020-04-14 19:07:43] <readme55> Hi, I created a community and 1 additional channel. When I press the "More dash-devs rooms" button, i dont get the channels-overview but instead go to PM with the "dash-devs" user i previously logged into gitter (before understanding how this all works). I converted that github user "dash-devs" to an organization and created the community. Now I cannot even login with that account anymore (github organization has no login) and delete it to fix this?
[2020-04-14 22:35:47] <MadLittleMods> readme55: I've updated yourhomeUrito [<-LINK->] 
[2020-04-14 22:36:40] <MadLittleMods> tizonia: Create an issue with the instructions/details you needed to get it working and we can add it to the wiki: [<-LINK->] 
[2020-04-15 00:11:51] <readme55> MadLittleMods: great thank you. But one more thing i noticed, eg. [<-LINK->] will forward to [<-LINK->] but [<-LINK->] will again lead to my dead "dash-devs" user and not forward. Any way to repair that?
[2020-04-15 02:11:38] <micah686> So I'm trying to create a community. When I try to put my github name as the community (gitter.im/micah686), it gives me "This address is not available. It already exists on Gitter ". However, going to that address only brings me to [<-LINK->] 
[2020-04-15 02:12:17] <micah686> Anyone know why I can't seem to use micah686 as the community name?
[2020-04-15 03:56:29] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @readme55Thedash-devsuser would need to be deleted. If you're unable to sign into the account because the GitHub account was deleted, send an email tosupport@gitter.im. Reply with the primary email address that was associated with that account before
[2020-04-15 03:58:22] <micah686> What dash-devs user are you talking about? And I'm signed into gitter from github
[2020-04-15 03:58:43] <MadLittleMods> micah686: Sorry wrong ping
[2020-04-15 04:00:37] <MadLittleMods>  April 14, 2020 9:11 PM @micah686 You're running into a known bug gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#2462I've just created the community for you https://gitter.im/micah686/home and a dummy room you can join and create your actually desired rooms
[2020-04-15 04:02:31] <micah686> I'm getting a 404 on that page. Also, how do you delete rooms that you have created?
[2020-04-15 04:03:30] <MadLittleMods> @micah686 Just fixed the link -> https://gitter.im/micah686/homeHere is how to delete a room: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-/blob/develop/docs/rooms.md#delete-a-room
[2020-04-15 04:12:23] <micah686> Thanks. I didn't realize that was a bug, and it was driving me nuts trying to create the community with my github name
[2020-04-15 09:23:02] <tizonia> MadLittleMods: : I've created the issue: [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-04-15 11:45:03] <readme55> MadLittleMods: i contacted support and got the user "dash-devs" deleted, but i still dont have the automatic forwarding from [<-LINK->] (wanna share this short link on website) to [<-LINK->] working. It says "Gitter 404 , this is not the chat you're looking for".
[2020-04-15 22:56:40] <MadLittleMods> @readme55 I removed the cached URI lookup earlier which was pointing at the old user but I am still not seeing the redirect. Not sure what other pieces are factoring into this: [<-CODE->] Here is some of the relevant code if you're curious: [<-CODE->] 
[2020-04-17 17:40:50] <jimmybrancaccio> Is there any rhyme or reason to how channels are listed in the sidebar?
[2020-04-17 17:51:56] <MadLittleMods> jimmybrancaccio: Here is code behind how they are sorted. Favourites -> mentions/unreads -> recently visited [<-CODE->] 
[2020-04-17 17:52:27] <jimmybrancaccio> Ah neat, thanks@MadLittleMods:)
[2020-04-19 10:34:33] <wsdjeg> hello, the android app still can not insert new line via enter. is this bug fixed?
[2020-04-19 18:24:59] <MadLittleMods> wsdjeg: You can track [<-ISSUE->] . Feel free to send a merge request
[2020-04-19 20:36:03] <antonyoni> Hi! I'm having some trouble setting up a community - I've both a GitLab and GitHub organisation account. When I tried to createreductechusing my GitLab acount, I received a "There is a URI clash with an org/repo/user on GitHub." error. I've managed to create the org using my GitHub account, but is it possible to link that up with GitLab instead of GitHub now?
[2020-04-19 21:42:14] <MadLittleMods> @antonyoni It's not possible to change the repo association after the fact but we can do it for you. Send the details to support@gitter.imYou can track the issues in this epic for post creation customization: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/399
[2020-04-19 23:11:12] <MadLittleMods> @rylew0925 This room is for Gitter support, the chat app itself. Please use https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/developers for general developer support.But it seems like https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/python would be the best room for you. You can use the search on the left to find other rooms
[2020-04-20 00:54:15] <jimmybrancaccio> It is just me or when the channel list is hidden, there’s a big white block where it used to be, the channel(s) themselves don’t expand to the left to fill the void.
[2020-04-20 01:21:55] <MadLittleMods> jimmybrancaccio: See [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-04-20 01:23:02] <jimmybrancaccio> Ah Eric for the win again.
[2020-04-20 02:40:23] <nafg> MadLittleMods: re [<-ISSUE->] thanks for adding some code links but I'm still missing a lot of the picture
[2020-04-20 02:45:22] <nafg> commented there
[2020-04-20 04:11:29] <MadLittleMods> nafg:  Responded
[2020-04-20 04:11:52] <MadLittleMods> nafg: If you want some more help tackling that, we can chat more in [<-LINK->] 
[2020-04-20 09:13:04] <antonyoni> MadLittleMods: Will do, thanks!
[2020-04-20 16:03:50] <kdund> Hi, everyone!Is there any way I can start a chat with a couple other people without making a specific chat room for it?
[2020-04-20 17:40:44] <MadLittleMods> kdund: You can only create a normal room or a one to one room with another user. Creating a private room and inviting the other users should fit your need
[2020-04-22 11:39:05] <johnmitz_gitlab> Hi everyone. Which tech is used for buildig gitter? (interested in backend tech for messaging and desktop apps)
[2020-04-22 18:56:08] <MadLittleMods> @johnmitz_gitlab It's all JavaScript. Node.js backend -> https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-/blob/develop/docs/code-overview.mdDesktop app is using NW.js -> https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/desktop/
[2020-04-22 19:40:06] <Nezteb> Is there a reason the official Desktop apps on [<-LINK->] were released in 2012/2013? Are there plans to re-release up-to-date desktop app versions? Or should I build my own locally?
[2020-04-22 19:53:30] <MadLittleMods> @Nezteb The apps have been built since 2012/2013 but the copyright note there is just old.If you're looking for the latest macOS app, there is an unsigned 4.1.0 that uses NW.js, http://update.gitter.im/osx/Gitter-4.1.0.dmg
[2020-04-22 19:54:06] <MadLittleMods> Nezteb: 4.1.0 has all the changes that are in the project, [<-LINK->] 
[2020-04-22 19:54:15] <Nezteb> Oh nice! Is there a reason those newer unsigned versions aren’t on the [<-LINK->] page? Even with a disclaimer “these are unsigned”?
[2020-04-22 19:55:42] <MadLittleMods> Nezteb: I'd be up for adding it with the note. Mind creating a merge request? The relevant code is here: [<-CODE->] 
[2020-04-22 19:57:14] <Nezteb> On it! Thanks!
[2020-04-22 20:35:36] <Nezteb> MadLittleMods: gitlab-org/gitter/webapp!1844
[2020-04-22 20:36:03] <MadLittleMods> Nezteb: Awesome! Will review it now
[2020-04-22 20:36:20] <MadLittleMods> Thanks for the contribution 
[2020-04-22 20:36:34] <Nezteb> Thank you for suggesting it and showing me the link to the newer installer! :D
[2020-04-22 21:20:16] <Nezteb> MadLittleMods: what's the easiest way to compile the handlebars templates and service up just the static site without the rest of the Gitter webapp?
[2020-04-22 21:20:56] <MadLittleMods> Nezteb: Probably not an easy way to separate everything. The handlebars stuff is compiled when the page is rendered/loaded
[2020-04-22 21:21:25] <Nezteb> Ah. I assume if i follow the full docker-compose and npm method it will also serve the static site?
[2020-04-22 21:21:49] <MadLittleMods> Nezteb: Correct 
[2020-04-22 21:22:02] <Nezteb> Excellent!
[2020-04-22 22:22:15] <Nezteb>  [<-LINK->] :D
[2020-04-22 22:50:35] <MadLittleMods> Nezteb: Looking at it now 
[2020-04-22 23:00:30] <MadLittleMods> @Nezteb Merged! Gitter 20.23.0 is deploying to staging/next right now  gitlab-org/gitter/webapp!1845. Once the deploy job on that MR passes, you should see your change https://gitter.im/appsYou can turn on staging/next on https://next.gitter.im/

[2020-04-23 13:39:29] <dreaminghexnut_twitter> hiii I'm new on Gitter.. I was just trying to log into Gitter with my Github account. But I got to GitHub's generic something went wrong page. I've tried this a few times in the last couple minutes. Always with the same result. Except once when I got to Chrome's time-out page. Anybody know what's going wrong there?
[2020-04-23 13:39:37] <dreaminghexnut_twitter> now I just tried the same thing in an incognito window and got to a different GitHub page, one with a unicorn and the text: "This page is taking too long to load. Sorry about that. Please try refreshing and contact us if the problem persists."
[2020-04-23 14:18:24] <grewn0uille> dreaminghexnut_twitter: GitHub got some troubles (as you can see here [<-LINK->] ), you can try later again
[2020-04-24 13:11:13] <andrii482> Hello. Is any tutorial how to change theme?
[2020-04-24 13:12:03] <andrii482> *gitter theme
[2020-04-24 13:13:14] <andrii482> I need something with more black colours
[2020-04-24 18:33:19] <ret394> can't change theme to be darker, I think.
[2020-04-24 19:08:52] <MadLittleMods> andrii482: @ret394You can turn on the dark theme, [<-LINK->] 
[2020-04-24 23:44:09] <ret394> can't change theme to be darker, I think.
[2020-04-26 17:58:32] <sparr> Is there a way for me to see all replies to my threads and mentions of my name?
[2020-04-26 18:22:34] <jimmybrancaccio> I am so confused as to why people come into this channel looking for help on learning various programming languages...?!
[2020-04-26 20:09:37] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @sparrNot yet, you can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-04-26 20:10:03] <sparr> not yet on threads, what about mentions?
[2020-04-26 20:11:35] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @jimmybrancaccioIt's a bit weird
[2020-04-26 20:12:30] <MadLittleMods> You can search for@sparrin a room but there isn't a view to see all your past mentions across Gitter
[2020-04-27 07:08:59] <andrii482> @MadLittleModsthank you !
[2020-04-29 09:24:23] <jdschuitemaker> Gitter.im keeps saying that I have unread messages, but I haven't. Clicking the "2 unread" scrolls the chat up a few lines and when I scroll down the message stays. I am seeing this behaviour on multiple PC's. Any ideas how to get rid of this?
[2020-04-29 11:09:40] <viktomas> jdschuitemaker: Is it possible that there is a conversation therad in the room?
[2020-04-29 11:11:01] <viktomas> Threaded conversations have been released recently and there could be a bug. If you are not comfortable to share more information publicly, please contact us onsupport@gitter.im
[2020-04-29 11:13:12] <jdschuitemaker> No@viktomas, I don't think there is a threaded conversation.
[2020-04-29 11:16:55] <viktomas> jdschuitemaker: That is strange. Can you use the/mark-all-readcommand to get rid of the notification?
[2020-04-29 11:18:35] <jdschuitemaker> I will try next time I see it and confirm. It is not always there and sometimes it says there is 1 unread and other times it is 2 or more unread messages. There are no messages with a green background at the time I see this 'warning'
[2020-04-29 11:23:22] <viktomas> Thanks@jdschuitemaker

[2020-04-29 19:54:55] <MadLittleMods> tanimislam: Yes, send a email tosupport@gitter.imwith the details
[2020-04-29 19:55:16] <MadLittleMods> tanimislam: Here are the docs around it: [<-LINK->] 
[2020-04-29 19:58:10] <tanimislam> MadLittleMods: sent from the email address of my gitter.im account.
[2020-04-29 20:02:05] <MadLittleMods> tanimislam: All done 
[2020-05-01 02:34:28] <wsdjeg> does gitter support pin message?
[2020-05-01 02:34:59] <wsdjeg> this is a nice feature for user to checkout the notifications.
[2020-05-01 02:36:03] <MadLittleMods> wsdjeg: Pinned/sticky messages aren't supported yet. You can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-05-01 02:36:26] <wsdjeg> thanks
[2020-05-01 16:12:32] <Daenyth> Is there a way I can stop getting unread notifications for threads that I'm not a part of?
[2020-05-01 16:12:52] <Daenyth> Now that gitter decided that channels aren't allowed to disable threads, the app is getting more and more disruptive to use
[2020-05-01 16:16:14] <Daenyth> Part of the point of threaded conversations is that side discussion can happen without disrupting the main conversation
[2020-05-02 02:09:35] <rahulmangla19> how to remove file drop in chat mistakenly ???
[2020-05-02 02:12:08] <rahulmangla19> found no need
[2020-05-04 13:31:32] <kdund> Hi, all! Some people use github usernames I do not recallIt seems that gitter will autocomplete also with display names inside a room, but could I configure it to complete within an entire organization? This would remove a lot of friction in inviting people to rooms
[2020-05-04 15:50:44] <MadLittleMods>  May 1, 2020 11:12 AM @Daenyth You can track gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#2483 for unsubscribing from threads and defaults for only subscribing if participating, etcYou could set the room to mute, but then you will only get notifications for direct mentions
[2020-05-04 15:59:24] <MadLittleMods>  May 4, 2020 8:31 AM @kdund When you first create the room, the collaborators view will suggest people related to you like other org members but that won't appear once someone else is in the room. Mind creating an issue for better whole org onboarding: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-/issuesRelated issues:gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#983

[2020-05-05 16:59:29] <mantenimientooutfire_gitlab> Hi
[2020-05-05 17:11:25] <MadLittleMods> mantenimientooutfire_gitlab:  Heya
[2020-05-05 17:20:30] <tbranyen> Hi is there is a way to force a dark theme using~embed? I don't see it available in sidecar v1 so I'm willing to bet this isn't possible. When I observe the change in the UI I notice a PUT and then a hash change#dark-theme, but using the hash does not seem to force it alone. I'm writing a UI that respects dark mode and it would be fantastic to be able to toggle this from the embed perspective.
[2020-05-05 18:02:26] <MadLittleMods> tbranyen: You can track [<-ISSUE->] . There is a potential solution mentioned there about adding a query parameter to override it/~embed?theme=dark/light, merge request welcome
[2020-05-05 18:13:03] <tbranyen> Very nice, thanks for the tip! I will absolutely look into that. Shouldn't be too hard since it seems the whole page can be toggled by a class name change.
[2020-05-05 18:35:06] <sebbu2> oh the channel changed name
[2020-05-05 18:35:20] <sebbu2> from #gitterHQ/gitter to #gitter/gitter
[2020-05-05 20:49:26] <tbranyen> MadLittleMods: any thoughts around reusing client-env for this use case?
[2020-05-05 20:49:31] <tbranyen> Already supports key:val
[2020-05-05 20:50:16] <tbranyen>  [<-CODE->] 
[2020-05-05 23:50:59] <MadLittleMods> tbranyen: I assume you are talking about the query string overrides you can provide toclient-env, [<-CODE->] . Seems like a clever use but not sure we should use it because from the [<-LINK->] , it looks like we use it for the config stuff that doesn't change between releases. Not really a user type of lookup
[2020-05-05 23:51:45] <MadLittleMods> sebbu2: Yep and linked to the GitLab project now :slight_smile: [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-05-05 23:55:43] <MadLittleMods> @tbranyen We should probably use https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-/tree/develop/modules/client-contextWhich gets filled in by this stuff: [<-CODE->] 
[2020-05-06 16:51:13] <jeffcsauer> Hi all - I realize this may be a redundant question but I've searched around a bit and have not had any luck. Is there a way to disable the sound notification for new messages when using Gitter for Windows? I have tried disabling sound notifications in Windows settings but they persist. Apologies if this is not the appropriate place.

[2020-05-06 16:53:59] <jeffcsauer> Oh wow I didn't even realize that was a drop down menu for settings - total error on my part, geez! Strange that didn't pop up in search results. Thanks for the rapid response!
[2020-05-06 16:54:58] <MadLittleMods> jeffcsauer: What did you search for? Where did you first land? We can add some documentation there about it
[2020-05-06 16:58:25] <jeffcsauer> MadLittleMods: I landed [<-LINK->] which is a well-documented page, but it doesn't include anything about the Gitter dropdown menu. The second Google link for 'windows desktop gitter turn off sound notifications' does [<-LINK->] a gitterHQ conversation about the dropwdown menu, but it doesn't actually take you to the place in the Gitter conversation once clicked. I really should have clicked around more! I only examined the upper right profile area for settings - honestly not a reflection on your documentation at all!
[2020-05-06 17:17:44] <MadLittleMods> jeffcsauer: We could mention it on one of these pages. Are you interested in creating a merge request? Here is the imagehttps://i.imgur.com/q6qud9N.pnghttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/master/docs/notifications.md

[2020-05-09 13:53:29] <dwelle> Hello. Wasfrom:usersearch query removed?
[2020-05-10 22:08:48] <mrpmorris> Hi all. I have a github.com project /mrpmorris/fluxor which I want to create a room for. At the moment I have been given the URL [<-LINK->] - I would like it to be [<-LINK->] or preferably just [<-LINK->] - how can I do that?
[2020-05-10 23:49:57] <pyramid3d> The thread feature is nice, but for some reason I can't add line breaks when chatting in a thread.In the main chat I can add a line break by doing Shift-Enter. But in the thread chat that will instead post the message. Anyone else seeing this?
[2020-05-11 03:18:39] <MadLittleMods>  [<-LINK->] @dwellefrom:usersyntax wasn't removed but you may be running into [<-ISSUE->]

[2020-05-11 06:46:26] <telukir_gitlab> I haveGitter Private Repo Accessin github but still unable to see my orgs in gitter .. is this because I don't seeGitter Public Repo Access? I tried several timeslogout and loginbut still does not work which was given [<-LINK->] 
[2020-05-11 09:21:29] <mrpmorris> Thanks@MadLittleMods!
[2020-05-11 14:58:32] <MadLittleMods> @telukir_gitlab Make sure you see Gitter Private Repo Access and Gitter Public Repo Access on https://github.com/settings/applications. Do you see both? [<-CODE->] The docs you linked are what you are after: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/blob/develop/docs/faq.md#why-isnt-my-github-organisation-or-repos-appearing
[2020-05-11 14:59:35] <MadLittleMods> telukir_gitlab: It looks like you are signing in with GitLab so you won't get prompted to add GitHub OAuth permissions. Sign in with GitHub and you will seeGitter Public Repo Accessasked to be granted
[2020-05-11 17:36:55] <kdund> Hi, all!I have a chat room where I am unable to @ - complete just one persons name. I see them in the participant list (searching for them in the participant list does not find them, either searching for the gitter handle or display name) Is there anywhere/how I could force gitter to re-index the participants so I don’t have to remember their gitter handle?
[2020-05-11 17:39:13] <kdund> (On a related note, is it possible to request gitter to show display names for @ -s also within text? (so that e.g.@kdundwould display as Knut? )
[2020-05-11 18:20:50] <kdund> 3rd related: @ - ing inside a a thread seems to lack typeahead which will make it harder to guide people into a threaded discussion rather than making new posts in the main thread
[2020-05-11 18:21:59] <telukir_gitlab> so now gitlab login and github login users are different right? can be both be merged? or what is the plan?
[2020-05-11 20:19:11] <MadLittleMods> kdlund: I just checked the ElasticSarch rivers and the user index is up to date. Which user are you trying to mention? Which room?
[2020-05-11 20:20:35] <MadLittleMods> Here is a related issue for display name next to username: [<-ISSUE->] . But would be good to create a new separate issue for including in the@mention
[2020-05-11 20:20:50] <MadLittleMods> You can track [<-ISSUE->] for typeahead support in threads
[2020-05-11 20:21:25] <MadLittleMods> See [<-LINK->] 
[2020-05-11 22:06:54] <dwelle> Thanks. That's probably it.
[2020-05-12 14:33:36] <kdund> I guess the typo in my username here illustrates point # 3 well@MadLittleMods:D!@WolfXeHDis the user in question, the room is an internal XENON collaboration room. Mentions are still not working for his name there..
[2020-05-12 14:55:13] <kdund> Unrelated question, what is the keyboard shortcut for search? Would it be possible to make it to be the system default (cmd+F on mac, ctrl+F otherwise etc..)

[2020-05-12 15:04:46] <MadLittleMods>  Definitely nice to have
[2020-05-12 15:04:48] <MadLittleMods> How much of the username are you typing? When I try@Wolf, it comes up with the user in the typeahead (sandbox room),
[2020-05-12 15:08:02] <dwelle> did threads stop notifying you about new replies?
[2020-05-12 15:10:21] <MadLittleMods> Threaded messages use the same notification setting as the whole room. They are treated the same as a normal message right now. [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-05-12 15:14:50] <kdund> 
[2020-05-12 15:15:55] <kdund> Could not add vid to thread, sorry about the non-organisation.
[2020-05-12 15:16:39] <MadLittleMods> No worries, you can just take[Screen Recording 2020-05-12 at 11.14.13.mov](https://files.gitter.im/gitter/gitter/FQI5/Screen-Recording-2020-05-12-at-11.14.13.mov)and paste it in the thread and delete your message

[2020-05-12 15:20:27] <dwelle> Oh, yea, I forgot I've had one room on mute. But I thought that when I create a thread, responses to that thread will notify me regardless (as they would for mention) -- not sure why I thought that

[2020-05-12 15:35:31] <MadLittleMods> It looks like the backend is responding  but is not returning any results when we expect it to. Feel free to create an issue to track: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-/issuesRelevant code:Frontend: [<-CODE->] Server: [<-CODE->] 
[2020-05-12 15:36:25] <MadLittleMods> Can you check the responses to the requests, just to make sure they are returning[]when you search@wolf?
[2020-05-12 15:37:50] <dwelle> cool, thanks
[2020-05-12 15:38:28] <dwelle> btw, do I need to set notis toAll messages, or does the default work?
[2020-05-12 15:40:02] <dwelle> And I mean when I interact with a thread, not for all threads in a room
[2020-05-12 15:41:07] <MadLittleMods> If you want to get a notification for any message in your thread, thenAllis right. There isn't any distinction for threads you interacted with vs other threads. You can track the issue I linked earlier for that kind of fine control
[2020-05-12 15:44:03] <kdund> Where do I see this in the dev log?
[2020-05-12 15:44:49] <kdund> If it’s the “response payload” I can confirm I get[]

[2020-05-12 15:46:41] <dwelle> 
[2020-05-12 15:48:29] <MadLittleMods>  Thanks for the info! Just ruling out as much as possible. Looks like our user index or ElasticSearch query isn't picking up that user in that room for some reason. The user appears in the typeahead for other rooms which makes this bug a lot more specific

[2020-05-16 12:50:26] <behrangsa> Guys, what are the ETA for features such as liking (with various emojis) and bookmarking replies and an improved UI/UX for creating threads?
[2020-05-18 05:51:27] <viktomas> mamrani111: For general developer conversation please use [<-LINK->] . This room is for support of Gitter.im itself.
[2020-05-18 06:09:39] <viktomas> @behrangsa These issue for gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#365. The idea is that you'd be able to see what messages you reacted to and so you don't need gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#2420.  Improved UI/UX for creating threads is part of our planned redesign.The redesign is happening in the next couple of months, implementing reactions is not scheduled.

[2020-05-19 19:26:57] <LaurentHayez> Hi, I can't upload avatar to my community rooms - after uploading avatar url request is time-outed. Any help with this? Thank youI have the same problem. Thanks.
[2020-05-19 19:34:26] <puremourning> not sure how to phrase this as a question, but are you guys aware of any issue with being unable to leave rooms ? Or at least, being unable to make leaving rooms stick ? I keep leaving rooms in the desktop app (such as this one actually!) and then as soon as  someone posts, i get a push notification and i'm back in the room for some reason (incidentally, i have notifications disabled for the room in question). I tend to have multiple gittger clients running on different machines, a number of mobile apps and the IRC bridge. could that be confusing my in-room status ?
[2020-05-19 19:35:20] <puremourning> perhaps to put it another way, do i need to sign out of the IRC bridge and leave the room onallof my devices? Or should leaving on one device be sufficient (if so, there does seem to be a bug here)
[2020-05-20 08:12:54] <aravta> I am not able to delete a personal chat which I accidentally clicked on
[2020-05-20 08:32:51] <viktomas> LaurentHayez: @nicktabolichWe've got some infrastructure problems with the avatars servers. But now we should have one server running and serving the avatars. Sorry for the outage.
[2020-05-20 08:37:30] <LaurentHayez> viktomas: It's working now, thanks
[2020-05-20 14:36:33] <viktomas> We are only aware of this (not being able to leave room) for One-To-One chats (which are just a special kind of a room)
[2020-05-20 14:39:17] <viktomas> What you describe sounds like a bug. Could you create an issue in [<-LINK->] ? with a brief description on how to reproduce (i.e. having multiple clients including mobile apps logged in)
[2020-05-20 14:39:59] <viktomas> My personal guess would be that the IRC bridge might be the culprit
[2020-05-20 22:43:09] <oakkitten> the hide-left-panel hamburger button is all but invisible on my monitor, perhaps make it as dark as the other buttons?
[2020-05-21 06:03:41] <pyrmont> viktomas: Thanks. That was the problem! :)
[2020-05-21 06:10:00] <viktomas> No worries :)
[2020-05-21 08:31:02] <viktomas> Thanks for pointing that out@oakkitten, I created an issue to track it [<-ISSUE->]

[2020-05-22 14:30:27] <niloc132> We're looking to add some community links to gitter from our assorted webpages, and are wondering if gitter provides any assets that we can use, or has guidelines on creating our own image using the four lined icon, possibly with customization to match our colors. I looked to the sidecar project to see if there were any ideas there (we don't really want a sidecar on the page itself, but hoped there might be good icons there), but that seems to be down right now, and it isn't clear to me where I could find a better source of icons and a "name/brand usage policy" to make sure we are respecting gitter's property

[2020-06-01 09:28:22] <viktomas> susam: Renaming a community is a manual process ( [<-LINK->] ) please emailsupport@gitter.im(which creates support ticket) and we'll change the display name for you.
[2020-06-01 16:57:55] <MadLittleMods> Which app are you referring to?
[2020-06-01 16:58:48] <MadLittleMods> You should be able to input markdown anywhere. There isn't a wysiwyg editor but you can type whatever you want, ex.**some bold text**
[2020-06-01 19:42:35] <susam> Hi@viktomas, I did send an email yesterday and I received a support ticket number 14031. I guess, I now have to wait for someone to look at it and help me with the renaming procedure.

[2020-06-06 10:01:12] <egil> is there a way to get the webapp to send a notification when I get a direct message from somebody?
[2020-06-06 10:01:22] <egil> it seems to work most of the time for chatrooms.
[2020-06-06 22:32:37] <MadLittleMods> egil: You can set your notifications to "All" and make sure your email notifications are turned on, [<-LINK->] 
[2020-06-06 22:38:40] <egil> MadLittleMods: do I have to set it toallto get notifications when people chat directly with me?
[2020-06-06 22:38:56] <egil> It seems like that should count as amentionchat type.
[2020-06-06 22:40:55] <egil> Or do I set it to 'all' in the default settings, and then go into each chat room and change that to only on mention?
[2020-06-06 22:45:03] <MadLittleMods> @egil A one to one room messages are no different to a normal message in a room. It sounds like you are after gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1275 [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
[2020-06-06 22:46:06] <egil> ok, thanks, ill try setting default to all and then override in the rooms I like.
[2020-06-07 02:24:53] <srnb_gitlab> How do I change my display name?
[2020-06-07 02:26:28] <MadLittleMods> Change it on GitLab then sign out of Gitter and back in, [<-LINK->] 
[2020-06-07 02:26:56] <MadLittleMods> But I suspect that might not work because of this bug: gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1834After you change it on GitLab, feel free to send an email to support@gitter.im

[2020-06-09 13:08:36] <zipswich> Is there a way to scroll back to a certain date (e.g. June 9, 2018)?
[2020-06-09 15:37:18] <MadLittleMods> zipswich: You can use the archive to go to that day, click on a message to get a permalink. Then use that permalink message ID in the normal chat likehttps://gitter.im/gitter/gitter?at=xxx
[2020-06-09 15:43:49] <zipswich> The problem is that I do not have a message for that day.
[2020-06-09 15:44:07] <zipswich> This is related to my yesterday's question.
[2020-06-09 15:44:37] <zipswich> I want to find my messages between June 10 and June 20, 2018.
[2020-06-09 15:51:46] <SQL-MisterMagoo> try this in the search in that room : sent:[2018-06-10 TO 2018-06-20] from:zipswich
[2020-06-09 15:53:51] <zipswich> 
[2020-06-09 15:53:55] <zipswich> Works!
[2020-06-09 15:57:31] <SQL-MisterMagoo> I know! I checked first
[2020-06-09 16:02:18] <zipswich> Thanks a lot.   Now, I am back to the original problem: the search only returns a certain number of messages.  For example, if I posted 100 messages during the specified period, the search returns only the last 10 to 20.
[2020-06-09 16:02:28] <zipswich> I tried to add a time element to deal with this.
[2020-06-09 16:02:52] <zipswich> I forgot to mention one important thing:
[2020-06-09 16:03:34] <zipswich> I cannot find a message, then scroll back because when I scroll back it jumps 2 years forward like a time machine.
[2020-06-09 16:10:19] <zipswich> I am trying to post a picture here, but it keeps going back to the main room.
[2020-06-09 16:12:22] <SQL-MisterMagoo> Is there something particular you are looking for - I have a search in a personal app (not public)  that might find it...you only seem to have 125 messages in that period, but the api could be wrong
[2020-06-09 16:13:24] <zipswich> Actually, if I can find the first message that I have ever posted, I should be all set.
[2020-06-09 16:13:39] <zipswich>  [<-LINK->] 
[2020-06-09 16:14:09] <zipswich> I posted a screenshot to show the time jump forward from June 2018 to June 2020.
[2020-06-09 16:15:49] <zipswich> This does not work:
[2020-06-09 16:15:55] <zipswich> sent:[2018-06-10 TO 2018-06-19 4:00 PM] from:zipswich

[2020-06-09 19:13:17] <cognifloyd> I'm excited to get the 4.2.0 gitter client (desktop linux).Is there a planned release date?gitlab-org/gitter/desktop!217was recently merged which replacedgitlab-org/gitter/desktop!215and should resolve the core dump issue I'm having with the linux client.
[2020-06-09 19:15:47] <cognifloyd> Or is the next release going to be 5.0.0?
[2020-06-09 19:16:58] <MadLittleMods> I think I will call it v5 just to play nice with semver in case anything breaks
[2020-06-09 19:19:56] <MadLittleMods> I want to make the release this week but currently focusing on another issue. I added an update to [<-LINK->] 
[2020-06-09 19:21:48] <MadLittleMods> SQL-MisterMagoo: Awesome tips! Mind creating a merge request to update the docs with thatsent:syntax? [<-LINK->] 
[2020-06-09 19:24:54] <MadLittleMods> @zipswich Earlier, I was recommending you browser the archives on the day you are looking for(https://gitter.im/gitter/gitter/archives/all) to find a random message on that day like https://gitter.im/gitter/gitter/archives/2019/09/10?at=5d7841e6b3e2fc57938c322fThen just use that same permlaink message ID in the normal chat view -> https://gitter.im/gitter/gitter?at=5d7841e6b3e2fc57938c322f
[2020-06-09 19:26:58] <zipswich> I found the trick from what@SQL-MisterMagoosent me:

[2020-06-10 02:10:10] <drocsid> Is there a way to remove a user fromAll conversations?
[2020-06-10 02:11:20] <drocsid> E.G. I see a DM conversation every time I look and want to remove it from my view.
[2020-06-10 02:12:02] <MadLittleMods> drocsid: You can hide the one to one conversation(DM), [<-LINK->] 
[2020-06-10 02:21:54] <drocsid> Thanks. Thought I read the docs but didn't...

[2020-06-11 08:25:13] <AnonymousK47_twitter> I am new to Gitter
[2020-06-11 08:25:27] <AnonymousK47_twitter> Someone tell me how to make a Community Or Room
[2020-06-11 08:44:30] <viktomas> AnonymousK47_twitter: Hope you'll enjoy our redesigned screen for creating community [<-LINK->] 
[2020-06-11 08:48:57] <SQL-MisterMagoo_gitlab> I'm trying out the Windows gitter app and, for some reason, it seems to have created a new user on Gitter even though I logged in using the same credentials I use on the Web app?
[2020-06-11 08:49:40] <SQL-MisterMagoo_gitlab> That is not useful to me - I want to be me, not me with _gitlab on the end

[2020-06-12 04:21:03] <AnonymousK47_twitter> This is the link of my community
[2020-06-12 11:10:27] <Manish-Giri> Hello, is there a way to see past unread messages? Gitter keeps showing me the notification that I have 6 unread messages (for quite some time now), but I can never actually see those 6 messages anywhere, it also doesn't show which community/communities those 6 messages are in.
[2020-06-12 16:13:07] <cognifloyd> woo hoo. No more core dump with this build!
[2020-06-12 16:15:07] <cognifloyd> The only issue I see is a weird white bar that doesn't respect the dark themes:
[2020-06-12 16:15:17] <cognifloyd>  [<-LINK->] 
[2020-06-12 16:15:41] <cognifloyd> v 5.0.0 has this whitebar that doesn't respect dark theme setting.
[2020-06-12 16:15:54] <cognifloyd> Is this expected? or a known bug?
[2020-06-12 23:11:48] <SQL-MisterMagoo> Are you seeing slow startup on V5, like it takes 20 seconds from clicking the app icon to it displaying a window?
[2020-06-13 10:34:52] <AnonymousK47_twitter> Manish-Giri: Bro, I am having the same bug in my gitter also.
[2020-06-14 06:44:24] <cognifloyd> 20 seconds? no. But I expect electron apps to be slow at startup. It's one of the downsides of embedding an entire browser.
[2020-06-14 09:34:49] <SQL-MisterMagoo> It took me a while to realise it was closing to the system tray and clicking that icon is faster
[2020-06-15 15:24:43] <MadLittleMods> Manish-Giri: It's possible that you have stuck unreads. You can use/mark-all-readto get things all marked as read to get rid of the badge
[2020-06-15 15:30:26] <MadLittleMods> cognifloyd: This is expected. Just the custom menubar that's part of the app and doesn't have any awareness of the dark theme yet. Here is the relevant code if you're interested in fixing it or feel free to [<-LINK->] : [<-CODE->] 
[2020-06-15 15:35:31] <MadLittleMods> SQL-MisterMagoo: The slow startup is because it has to unpack/unzip everything in the app before it starts up. It's expected for now but not a great experience. I mentioned in [<-ISSUE->] for example
[2020-06-15 15:36:00] <MadLittleMods> cognifloyd: I assume you are on Linux? Thanks for trying out the app! What flavor of Linux are you using?

[2020-06-16 23:40:54] <JESii> I want to add an image to a thread, but everytime I try it goes into the main chat, not the thread...

[2020-06-17 11:43:39] <Gizmotronn> Hey guys, just a quick message, wondering if better integrations with github issues (like labels, channels, etc) and discussions may come around?
[2020-06-17 14:22:22] <SQL-MisterMagoo> Sometimes I'm seeing double when I paste an image...on V5.01 - is that just me?
[2020-06-17 17:07:03] <ghost~5d65766ed73408ce4fc96463> Iv looked in the documentation but can't find out how to turn off alerts from heroku. they come thru my pc and are very disturbing to me and my clients TIA
[2020-06-17 17:07:11] <MadLittleMods> IrisDroidology: Can you expand on what you mean? Feel free to create an issue: [<-LINK->] 
[2020-06-17 17:08:07] <MadLittleMods> 4ElizabethS: You probably want to set your notification settings to "Mute" for the room, [<-LINK->] 
[2020-06-17 17:09:04] <ghost~5d65766ed73408ce4fc96463> where do I find my "Notifications" so I can mute them
[2020-06-17 17:09:59] <ghost~5d65766ed73408ce4fc96463> got it ...I think ty!!!
[2020-06-17 17:09:59] <MadLittleMods> You can access the notification settings through the room settings icon(vertical sliders) in the top-right of the chat header -> Notifications.https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-/blob/develop/docs/notifications.md#notifications
[2020-06-17 17:12:01] <MadLittleMods> SQL-MisterMagoo: What platform are you on? (Windows, macOS, Linux) I tried pasting a few images on macOS and didn't see anything. Something did change around uploads recently so it's possible there is a bug
[2020-06-17 17:19:13] <cognifloyd> Gentoo :)
[2020-06-17 17:20:20] <cognifloyd> I extract the .deb to install.
[2020-06-17 17:27:47] <MadLittleMods>  Thanks for the info! Boosts my confidence in the release
[2020-06-17 17:28:33] <cognifloyd> I just switched to 5.0.1, and I'm typing this message in that release.
[2020-06-17 17:28:42] <cognifloyd> :D
[2020-06-17 17:39:41] <MadLittleMods> 
[2020-06-17 19:30:57] <SQL-MisterMagoo> I'm on Windows - I only see it occasionally - probably not worth spending time on
[2020-06-17 20:08:41] <wingedrhino> Hi! Can someone tell me where I can find the apt signing key and repository URL for installing gitter in an automated way on an Ubuntu/Debian system?
[2020-06-17 20:09:26] <wingedrhino> I currently only see a .deb package provided for installation.
[2020-06-17 20:12:13] <wingedrhino> Also, is a build for the Raspberry Pi officially published? Or is it recommended to simply use the browser version?
[2020-06-17 20:32:49] <MadLittleMods> The app is only distributed for Linux officially on the apps page: [<-LINK->] 
[2020-06-17 20:33:24] <MadLittleMods> We only have.debbuilds. Browser is definitely the top recommended client
[2020-06-17 21:56:35] <pasha-pivo> Hey guys! Just installed an update on my Ubuntu and now I cannot see the window of the app. It is I  the list of running processes but I don't know how to interact with it. Though I could delete a config file, but couldn't find it. Almost no errors in terminal. Just notification about deprecated Buffer. Is there a workaround about this?
[2020-06-17 23:01:46] <MadLittleMods> pasha-pivo: It's probably running in the background. Do you see the tray icon in the top-right? Otherwise you can try these steps: [<-LINK->] 
[2020-06-18 01:06:46] <mrbobpowell> Hey Folks, I'm running Windows 10 release 2004. About every hour or so, I get a popup notification that says I should update my app. When I try, the update fails because it says that there are other Gitter apps running (even when I've just rebooted) and the update fails.  So now I'm getting these notifications that I can't do anything about. I've tried to delete the app, I've tried turning it off as a startup app, it's not in my notifications panel, and yet still this distracting pop-up every little while. How can I make this stop?? HELP! Happy to use the app if I can successfully update it.
[2020-06-18 01:31:21] <ghost~5d65766ed73408ce4fc96463> I'm having the same problem. It's making me insane!!!
[2020-06-18 01:33:42] <mrbobpowell> Me too!
[2020-06-18 03:01:42] <MadLittleMods> @mrbobpowell @4ElizabethS If you download v5.0.1 and just install over top of whatever version you have, it should work: https://gitter.im/appsThere is no auto-update, just re-installing the new version over top of the other. If the installer is saying you need to close the Gitter application, you can right-click -> Exit from the tray icon in the bottom-right of Windows
[2020-06-18 03:02:31] <mrbobpowell> Nope, I've tried it at least 3 times. Even ran it as admin. Tried ingoring the errors and overwriting, nothing works.
[2020-06-18 03:03:06] <mrbobpowell> I even deleted the app from my machine and rebooted, and still it's giving me these messages and didn't remove it.
[2020-06-18 03:15:22] <MadLittleMods> @mrbobpowell What errors are you seeing?To uninstall completely, see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/desktop/-/issues/175#note_34050400
[2020-06-18 03:21:29] <mrbobpowell> Hey, that advice fixed it. I had not thought of quitting the applications in TaskManager (relatively new to Windows, really a linux guy). Once I could quit the zombie process, I was able to install the new version correctly. Hopefully this will stave off the notifications.
[2020-06-18 03:21:46] <mrbobpowell> MadLittleMods: Thank you Eric!
[2020-06-18 03:43:00] <MadLittleMods> mrbobpowell: Glad that sorted it out! :slight_smile:
[2020-06-18 04:23:31] <pasha-pivo> Yes, looks like that. The old one used to start in the background. But it had an icon in the tray. I think that some setting has been changed and it makes it work like that. Maybe it can work if I remove user configs or the whole directory in the user space?
[2020-06-18 04:35:58] <cognifloyd> speaking with the force, like a jedi: Stick with linux - windows is not what you want
[2020-06-18 04:52:48] <MadLittleMods> Possible, sometimes it just seems to decide to start in the background. The path to preferences on each platform is listed here: [<-LINK->] 
[2020-06-18 20:27:10] <pasha-pivo> Thank you! It was so obvious! Stupid I am))) Removed the folder and it worked.
[2020-06-18 20:35:21] <pasha-pivo> But it is still strange. No icon. The old one had an icon in the tray... I have Ubuntu 16.04 on my laptop. The link above seems to be used for 18.04, not my release. I never had problems with icons in the system tray.
[2020-06-18 20:43:00] <pasha-pivo> No it didn't work. After I close the app window, it goes backgroud and gets unreachable. I usekillall Gitterand start it again to make it work again.
[2020-06-18 21:03:39] <MadLittleMods> You may need different libraries to get a tray icon in a different version of Ubuntu
[2020-06-19 12:22:16] <pasha-pivo> I think so. But the previous version of Gitter worked pretty well with the tray. I didn't have any problems with that. I mean, maybe something wrong with the new version of Gitter?
[2020-06-19 13:52:00] <MadLittleMods> It's possible something is wrong in our code but we're just using the built-in NW.js tray menu (same as before). You can track [<-ISSUE->] for more details
[2020-06-19 18:46:25] <aaronsteers> Please help! I keep getting messages to install Gitter 5.0.1 update. They popup as toast messages and I have no idea where they are coming from. Because of these unwanted toast messages, I uninstalled the Gitter program, attempted to block the gitter.im site notifications in both Edge and Chrome, and checked both browsers for an extension. What do I do???
[2020-06-19 18:47:14] <MadLittleMods> aaronsteers: See [<-LINK->] 
[2020-06-19 18:57:39] <aaronsteers> Thank you, Eric. That worked. It took a little digging through the comments though, so I posted exactly the steps that worked for me there on the ticket: [<-LINK->] 
[2020-06-19 18:59:07] <MadLittleMods>  Added your instructions to a workaround section in the issue description! [<-LINK->] 
[2020-06-21 13:13:31] <tebeco> not sure if the update is worse it as it is today :App start but refuse to show the UI
When it shows up, the channel are not up to date (i see multiple day of history missing (diff with phone)
App refuse to properly stop (ghost process)
No "repair" options on the installer
[2020-06-21 13:14:12] <tebeco> it feels like a 5.0.2 is needed as fast as possible, else people won't be able to use gitter AT ALL anymore after the update
[2020-06-21 13:15:22] <tebeco> and the Phone app decided to stop showing the user that typed a message so I have a huge history with Q&A but no way to differenciate anyhing :(
[2020-06-21 13:26:37] <tebeco> ok the Desktop app either can't upload image -_-
[2020-06-21 13:28:34] <tebeco> 
[2020-06-21 13:29:13] <tebeco> this shows both the bug "no user visible" and "lost history", if you compare it withaspnet/signalr
[2020-06-21 17:18:19] <ret394> the banner "Get Started: Spread the word" for a new room re-appears if you reload the window with F5. great job with support@MadLittleMods, thanks a lot.
[2020-06-21 17:24:52] <tebeco> ok so .... Mobile app can't understandThread, if you do use them ... users won't be able to understand what's happening
[2020-06-21 23:22:15] <MadLittleMods> Please create an issue with more details: [<-LINK->] 
[2020-06-21 23:23:27] <MadLittleMods> Threads are minimally supported in the mobile apps, [<-LINK->] 
[2020-06-21 23:44:37] <tebeco> did you just replied in a thread related to a thread bug ;) ?the display of your msg is kinda weird
[2020-06-21 23:59:07] <MadLittleMods> This is expected. This banner will show whenever you are in a room by yourself
[2020-06-21 23:59:46] <MadLittleMods> For simplicity sake, easier to have the logic this way than having to persist when you dismissed it
[2020-06-22 00:01:18] <tebeco> no i mean the fact of using a feature that was just reported to have issue ;)so that there's 100% chances of re-raising the issue ;)hopefully if it does make the app crash ^^
[2020-06-22 00:01:43] <tebeco> for example i don't see your name anymore
[2020-06-22 00:01:57] <tebeco> and all msg are never marked as read
[2020-06-22 00:05:48] <MadLittleMods> tebeco: I'm not sure what's going wrong with your app. Nothing has changed there. For reference, I tested on Android and iOS and I can see the message author. Please create an issue with the details you have so we can track this in one spot: [<-LINK->]

[2020-06-24 01:08:11] <Kabouik> Good to know, thank you! In the end I ditched the ZNC bouncer anyway, it was overkill and caused too many other issues. I use a CLI IRC client anyway so server + screen + client, and ssh to it

[2020-07-10 22:23:38] <KartikSoneji> I can type two different kinds of emojis:  and
[2020-07-10 22:23:54] <KartikSoneji> Is this intended behaviour?
[2020-07-10 22:24:30] <MadLittleMods> KartikSoneji: Yep for now. The emoji picker syntax is separate from the native Unicode emoji
[2020-07-10 22:26:25] <KartikSoneji> MadLittleMods: OK, thanks.
[2020-07-10 22:29:29] <MadLittleMods> KartikSoneji: You can track [<-ISSUE->] for native Unicode emoji built into the picker

[2020-07-14 13:48:12] <peter-gerhard> Hey, I just saw that if I use emojis in gitter like   the default skin-tone is white, and that the suggestion also does not provide any other skin tones. How would one send emojis in other skin tones?
[2020-07-14 13:53:17] <MadLittleMods> peter-gerhard: There isn't a way to select other skin tones with the emoji picker. You can track [<-ISSUE->] and [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-07-14 13:55:18] <MadLittleMods> peter-gerhard: You can type the Unicode emoji manually with your keyboard on macOS(Command+Ctrl+Space) and Windows 10 (Windows+.)
[2020-07-14 13:57:17] <peter-gerhard>  [<-ISSUE->] was opened 3 years ago.
[2020-07-14 13:57:54] <peter-gerhard> I wonder why contrary to the usual approach of simpsons-like yellow white was chosen as the default color
[2020-07-14 13:58:10] <peter-gerhard> I guess you see why thats problematic and the ticket should be pushed
[2020-07-14 13:59:14] <peter-gerhard> I hope this can be  added soon. It would be nice to show progressive attitude in a tool that is so widely used
[2020-07-14 14:10:42] <MadLittleMods> peter-gerhard: As a quick fix I was thinking we could replace some of the images in [<-LINK->] . I looked through it and the list is kinda long to tackle all of them. Would you be interested in making a pull request to update some of them?
[2020-07-14 14:18:03] <peter-gerhard> hey@MadLittleMods, do you know the source for those images? I would just replace them with the yellow ones but I need to get the correct thumbnails
[2020-07-14 14:19:41] <peter-gerhard> gitterHQ/emojify.js@4a9e5a9
[2020-07-14 14:20:08] <peter-gerhard> I think there is a script loading them from another source that has the same problem :)
[2020-07-14 14:21:38] <peter-gerhard> I will have a look
[2020-07-14 17:45:55] <grewn0uille> Hi! Is there a way to send a picture when using the android app ?
[2020-07-14 17:58:54] <MadLittleMods> grewn0uille: Not possible to upload a image, relevant issue: [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-07-14 17:59:17] <MadLittleMods> But you could upload it somewhere else and add it with markdown![](http://example.com/myimage.jpg)
[2020-07-14 18:00:03] <grewn0uille> Thanks! :)
[2020-07-14 20:37:14] <corneliusroemer> Likewise, threads don't work on Android app right. I can't seem to reply thus create a thread

[2020-07-14 20:56:40] <gitleet> I tried adding  tripple ticks...before and after..
[2020-07-14 20:57:00] <gitleet> but then I couldn't actually submit the code snippet, I tried pressing switch to chat/compose mode and it didn't work.
[2020-07-14 20:57:36] <gitleet> ok found it :)
[2020-07-14 20:57:39] <gitleet> cmd + enter

[2020-07-14 23:13:31] <SQL-MisterMagoo> I guess it's not worth worrying about - I'll revert to the web app - desktop app being a tech debt anyway
[2020-07-15 22:42:25] <ericmartinezr> Hey guys, random question, not sure if this is the place to ask it though. Can anyone see this chatroom [<-LINK->] ? I'm getting a 404. I can see others without issues.
[2020-07-15 22:44:44] <ericmartinezr> I have a slight suspicion of what it is, just wanted to confirm it.
[2020-07-15 22:45:07] <ericmartinezr> MadLittleMods: sorry to ping you directly, can you see if I have a special status in that chatroom? :P
[2020-07-15 22:45:24] <MadLittleMods> ericmartinezr: I can see the room just fine for reference

[2020-07-17 03:42:31] <thenrich2009> Why when I go to gitter.im I am always back in the room I was?? How does one then explore other rooms?
[2020-07-17 18:05:53] <MadLittleMods> thenrich2009: You can use one of these pages to look at other rooms. Where do you want to be when you go togitter.im?Use the search in the left-menu
Use the explore page: https://gitter.im/home/explore
If you want to go to the homepage, https://gitter.im/?redirect=no
[2020-07-20 18:12:43] <puremourning> Any update/understanding why Gitter.app still requires the high performance GPU on macbooks? I think this is an electron woe, but it’s just a battery killer and lap-warmer.
[2020-07-20 18:14:44] <puremourning>  [<-LINK->] 
[2020-07-20 18:14:57] <MadLittleMods> puremourning: Just a quirk of the old Safari backed desktop app. You can use the unsigned NW.js version of the app, [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-07-20 18:17:24] <MadLittleMods> puremourning: At this point, we're not pushing NW.js for macOS because it isn't signed and haven't looked into it. We're looking into deprecating the desktop apps so this is less likely to happen though, [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-07-20 18:20:41] <puremourning> oh boy. thanks! i feel like you've actually told me that before; is the limitation with signing that it's a NW.js app? I mean in the sene that you're publishing the iOS app in the app store, so i assume you have all the appropriate credentials ;) let me know if there's anything i can do to help. i was planning on looking at updating the iOS app again soon. i imagine when iOS vN+1 comes out there will be things to look at
[2020-07-20 18:22:25] <MadLittleMods> I think the only limitation is us devoting some time to it. If you have some steps to create the right credentials with Apple and a MR to update the build code, I'd be willing to merge
[2020-07-20 18:23:17] <puremourning> ok ta. i have 2 weeks off work, so i'll add it to my (ever growing) list of oss things to do :)

[2020-07-22 16:10:00] <ityulkanov> Hi, I'm using the linux app, and it is simply disappears from the taskbar after some time, nothing in the statusbar as well. So, I have to kill it via process manager, and then restart again. Is there a setting to fix this behaviour?
[2020-07-22 17:12:55] <MadLittleMods> ityulkanov: The Gitter app will run in the background and you can restore it from the tray icon. But there are some issues with tray icon on Linux, [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-07-22 17:19:01] <MadLittleMods> ityulkanov: Do these docs for getting the tray icon on Ubuntu still apply? [<-LINK->]

[2020-07-26 15:02:28] <AzySir> Hey gitter how do I create a thread on my Android mobile ?
[2020-07-26 15:02:55] <j0hnmeow> Mobile apps are unsupported afaik
[2020-07-26 15:03:42] <j0hnmeow> The dedicated Android/iOS apps are no longer recommended and may be officially deprecated in the future. For mobile, we recommend using the mobile web version in your browser.
[2020-07-26 23:58:30] <MadLittleMods> AzySir: It's not possible to create/reply to a thread in the mobile apps. Threads are only minimally supported there, [<-LINK->] 
[2020-07-27 15:54:03] <AzySir> Interesting - so how far along is GITTER is this in Beta Stage? It's got the right idea I'm assuming it's a rolling forward type of set up right?
[2020-07-27 16:23:16] <EwaJanska_twitter> hi
[2020-07-27 16:23:32] <EwaJanska_twitter> how can i change my profile picture?
[2020-07-27 16:23:52] <EwaJanska_twitter> i did that on twitter and relog here didnt helped
[2020-07-27 17:25:41] <MadLittleMods> AzySir: At GitLab, we value iteration: [<-LINK->] 
[2020-07-27 17:31:49] <MadLittleMods> EwaJanska_twitter: You are probably running into [<-ISSUE->] . I've manually updated your avatar. If you refresh, you should see it in place

[2020-07-30 01:48:58] <rkazak> How do I get to the top of the message stream without having to scroll top the top, is there a short-cut key I can use?
[2020-07-30 05:47:15] <MadLittleMods> rkazak: You can click the unread badge in the top-right to jump to the top,
[2020-08-01 17:04:25] <rkazak> MadLittleMods: Hm, I don’t see that could that be some setting I need to apply?
[2020-08-01 17:07:21] <rkazak> Hm also tried to include an image but for some reason it’s not showing up :(
[2020-08-01 17:25:01] <rkazak> I also found another way via the Archive route!
[2020-08-01 18:08:43] <MadLittleMods> That unread badge will only appear when you have enough unreads outside of your viewport. Maybe you're looking the Home and End keys on your keyboard which will scroll all the way to to the top and bottom
[2020-08-06 15:24:09] <BaronRK> 
[2020-08-06 15:28:04] <BaronRK> That SHIFT ENTER Image should be here in the sub-thread, not in the main thread.
[2020-08-06 16:11:35] <MadLittleMods> @BaronRK [<-CODE->] Feel free to create an issue for any of these points so we can track it better, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issuesIf there is something particularly annoying and you're up to create a merge request, the code base is open source, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp
[2020-08-06 18:42:36] <BaronRK> [I'm going to address each of these by my original names.  Also thank you for your kind and quick reply.]RETURN/ENTERI'm on Win10, Yoga 940, Chrome, nothing special or modded.NOPE, SHIFT + ENTER, CONTROL + ENTER, nor ALT + ENTER changes the behaviour.  I even tried the other side of the keyboard's versions of these. If you would like video proof, more than happy to provide.  I'm patient.  Also, other people are complaining about this same things.  This does work in LinkedIn, Facebook, and my own Reply box in the SaaS I designed.Before I we move forward, let's see if we can really nail the problem with this one thing.  I'm currently writing and editing my messages in Open Writer then pasting into Gitter.
[2020-08-06 18:50:46] <dman777> is it possible not to display my full name?
[2020-08-06 19:05:30] <MadLittleMods> BaronRK: Ahh, I think I know what you are running into. You are referring to writing new lines in the threaded conversation textbox which is currently not supported. You can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-08-06 19:06:02] <MadLittleMods> You can write your response in another text editor and paste the multi-line message in the thread though. This is what I did for my previous reply
[2020-08-06 19:07:31] <MadLittleMods> dman777: If you want to remove it from Gitter, you would have to remove it from GitHub. Then sign out and back in to Gitter. [<-LINK->] 
[2020-08-06 19:09:16] <MadLittleMods> The [<-LINK->] . Merge request welcome if you want to take a stab on a simple iteration to allow "Shift + Enter" to work
[2020-08-06 21:07:16] <BaronRK> Indeed!  Yes, now we are saying, and seeing the same thing.  Cool.  And yes, as I mentioned, I am writing my multi-line stuff in OpenOffice Writer.
[2020-08-06 21:07:55] <BaronRK> Thank you for link to source, I'm going to hand this to my team and see if one of us wants to tweak this, which brings up a simple question:
[2020-08-06 21:08:50] <BaronRK> Why are we not just installing a RichTextEditor here directly (CKeditor on the heavy side, or some JQuery widget on the light side?)?
[2020-08-06 22:01:25] <MadLittleMods> Some basic formatting buttons sounds nice like [<-ISSUE->] but I don't think we would go full WYSIWYG
[2020-08-07 03:48:01] <BaronRK> Yes, exactly!  This would make this rock :)
[2020-08-07 17:23:02] <BaronRK> Madlittlemods: 
[2020-08-07 17:23:26] <BaronRK> Ok, I'm getting my head around this, and as proof, here is your name in a boxEric Eastwood
[2020-08-07 17:24:07] <BaronRK> Seems, we can go into an edit mode by clicking on thechat iconwhich toggles to akeyboard.
[2020-08-07 17:24:25] <BaronRK> from there, at least the main thread, you can now compose, hit returns, etc.
[2020-08-07 17:24:48] <BaronRK> BUT, you can't do THAT from this sub-thread. [<-CODE->] 
[2020-08-07 17:25:35] <BaronRK> I'm part of a Gitter group of about 1K programmers, and none of us knew this, so I just wrote it up for everyone (who all have been complaining about this).
[2020-08-07 17:27:21] <MadLittleMods> The reason they behave different is because they are different. The threaded conversations UI is in Vue.js. The main chat view is in old backbone/Marionette
[2020-08-07 17:29:12] <BaronRK> Normal Modehttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-/blob/develop/docs/messages.md#writing-messagesSo this claim:Enter - to send messageShift + Enter - to go to new lineSeems not to be true as best I can tell so far.
[2020-08-07 20:19:32] <MadLittleMods> It's true but only for the main chat view.  As [<-LINK->] , new lines aren't supported in threaded conversation input yet.
[2020-08-10 10:58:38] <haggen> hi hello! can i transfer ownership of a gitter community? if so, how? thanks in advance!
[2020-08-10 14:45:19] <MadLittleMods> @haggenYou can add new admins for a room by visiting a room in the community -> Room settings dropdown -> Permissions modal -> Edit community permissionshttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-/blob/develop/docs/communities.md#community-admins
[2020-08-10 16:15:29] <BaronRK> [following up on each item]Me: 'GENERAL UI - Why is Hamburger Menu lower right as opposed to upper right'You: 'Using a hamburger icon to expand/collapse the menu seems standard to me (ex. YouTube).'Uh, but, YouTube has it in the upper left.  Perhaps I can ask it this way 'can you find a single example of a popular site that does what gitter is doing, and putting it in the lower right of a slide on card or menu?'[I hope this discussion is constructive for you, I've designed over 120 consumer products for companies like Apple, Disney, MS, etc.  If you don't want to discuss any of this, I'm never offended]:)
[2020-08-10 16:23:08] <MadLittleMods> Upper left is definitely standard. It's just an old design artifact and was part of the designs early on. Open to changing it up if you have a better idea (create an issue). No worries, your tone hasn't been berating so far
[2020-08-10 18:35:09] <BaronRK> LOL, cool, indeed, I truly have the best intention and wish to be helpful.  And I appreciate you eating your own dog food (shove everything into issues, etc.)  I do the same thing with  my own system.  I will do this after I get a little clearer why things are the way they are, etc. :)
[2020-08-11 00:13:17] <MadLittleMods> BaronRK: Is this the globe 'other rooms' problem you were seeing before? [<-LINK->] 
[2020-08-11 01:33:18] <BaronRK> I did notice that, and it did confuse me.  But, no, I'm simply suggesting that we have this list of threads on the left side 'ALL CONVERSATIONS'.  In my mind, right three, or even above that, is where one would go to see more worlds.  Slack does this (although I'm not a fan of Slack).  But this is also simply how a folder structure works.  If I click above ALL CONVERSATIONS, should we go to ROOT?
[2020-08-11 02:00:58] <MadLittleMods> BaronRK: Your reply is confusing to me. Do you mean this? [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-08-11 03:04:13] <wztdream> Hi, how to do searching in a specific room?
[2020-08-11 03:05:02] <MadLittleMods> wztdream: Search only looks for messages for the current room you're viewing, [<-LINK->] 
[2020-08-11 03:08:11] <wztdream> But, I just type "Hi, how to do" why there is no results?
[2020-08-11 03:09:45] <wztdream> aH, sorry, my mistake
[2020-08-11 03:10:04] <wztdream> thank you
[2020-08-11 03:17:56] <BaronRK> :) you open to a quick vid/call?

[2020-08-12 20:30:10] <danielhorizon> I'm trying to pull in another user's list of rooms that they're in. Is this possible? It seems that I can access the /v1/users/:username endpoint (which also isn't in the documentation) to gather basic information, but nothing about that user's list of gitter channels or rooms (not my own).

[2020-08-13 04:15:05] <Nagimagi> Hi, can't sent the picture on the chat window, can someone plz solve this?
[2020-08-13 05:24:38] <BaronRK> Just drag and drop from a file manager?
[2020-08-13 05:50:58] <MadLittleMods> @Nagimagi Are you running into an error? What's stopping you?To upload a file, you drag and drop it onto the chat area
[2020-08-13 07:11:28] <Nagimagi> I thought ctrl+v could do the magic
[2020-08-13 12:26:43] <BaronRK> [CTRL]+[V] will paste the text contents of your local device's clipboard.
[2020-08-13 12:28:21] <BaronRK> Side note, about 15 years ago Ray Ozzie (and a group of us) suggested a web based Cut Copy Paste.  Sadly, the world hates a real standard...
[2020-08-13 12:28:22] <BaronRK>  [<-LINK->] 
[2020-08-13 12:57:22] <Nagimagi> Thx for your kind reply and the reference worth noting.
[2020-08-16 07:41:18] <Mikolaj> Hi! I think [<-LINK->] is down. At least it does not join [<-LINK->] that I bridged with a matrix room #lambdahack:mozilla.org. It did work yesterday one way, relaying gitter messages to matrix (and discord bridged with the matrix), but when I restarted it, the bot stopped joining the gitter room and it doesn't work despite many tries.
[2020-08-16 17:22:54] <XtremeGood> Hi, my menu is full of channels, how do I remove a channel from the list?
[2020-08-16 18:05:46] <MadLittleMods> Thanks for the report@Mikolaj. I've unbanned@matrixbot
[2020-08-16 18:06:46] <MadLittleMods> XtremeGood: You will need to click each channel, then leave or hide the channel from the room settings dropdown in the chat header, [<-LINK->] 
[2020-08-16 18:16:36] <Mikolaj> thank you so much; after your intervention it works, but in the opposite way only (on gitter I can see the matrix messages) and I can't see the bot among room member; when I add it manually nothing improves
[2020-08-16 19:07:34] <MadLittleMods> Mikolaj: I'm not sure exactly how@matrixbotworks to rejoin and sync messages again. Make sure you haven't banned the bot from the room specifically/unban @matrixbot
[2020-08-16 19:08:22] <MadLittleMods> I've removed your webhook URL as someone may be able to post arbitrary messages to your integration activity. Consider rotating it to refresh it anyway if it's stale
[2020-08-16 19:59:17] <XtremeGood> oops there are so many channels accumulated. Leaving one by one will be a hectic task but thanks for informing@EricEastwood
[2020-08-16 20:27:08] <Mikolaj> thank you very much; on Monday the kind people from mozilla.org will try some brutal means, so I hope it's going to work; cheers!
[2020-08-17 15:17:33] <Mikolaj> after your work and@Half-Shot's it works now --- thank  you so much!
[2020-08-18 16:35:22] <MedicatedGorilla> Hi, I am trying to find a VBA community that is active. Any recommends?

[2020-08-23 17:05:00] <crazecoder>  [<-LINK->] 
[2020-08-23 22:02:33] <MadLittleMods> @kiti-nomad  "gitter如何静音啊?" -> "How to mute Gitter?"You can set your notification settings to mute, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-/blob/develop/docs/notifications.md#mute [<-CODE->] 
[2020-08-23 22:06:09] <MadLittleMods> @crazecoder Please create an issue so we can track this, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-/issuesWe've seen forbidden errors when signing in with GitLab which is caused when the user still needs to verify their email and agree to the ToS on GitLab.But not sure why it would happen for GitHub
[2020-08-23 23:50:48] <oakkitten> hi, i have a problem with unsubscribing from email notifications. i seteverythingto "notify me only when i'm directly mentioned" but i'm still getting emails with "100 unread messages (3 most recent)". it looks like it's limited to a single conversation
[2020-08-23 23:57:51] <oakkitten> also, in the conversation list, this room is listed as "Gitter/gitter", but the room "python-trio/general" is listed as just "general". why's that?
[2020-08-24 04:33:33] <MadLittleMods> @oakkitten This is a known limitation of the "Announcements" setting. The "Announcements" setting still tracks unread counts in the left-menu which are tied to email notifications. You can track this issue, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1205In terms of getting what you desire:You can use the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any unread email notification, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-/blob/develop/docs/notifications.md#emails
You can adjust your rooms to the "Mute" setting which will only notify you when you are mentioned

[2020-08-24 13:58:46] <MadLittleMods> @tebeco Mind creating an issue to track it, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/desktop/-/issuesIf you open the devtools (from the Gitter menu in the top-left), do you see any errors? Add the details to the issue

[2020-08-24 15:51:35] <MadLittleMods> tebeco: I recommend using the remote debugging I explained in [<-LINK->] . The [<-LINK->] isn't as good

[2020-08-24 17:22:37] <tebeco> sorry
[2020-08-27 05:39:33] <productceo> How do you edit the name of a Gitter community?
[2020-08-27 05:40:07] <MadLittleMods> productceo: See [<-LINK->] 
[2020-08-27 06:17:02] <productceo> I see it is not supported yet. Thanks!
[2020-08-30 21:41:42] <oakkitten> i'm not using the "Announcements" setting though. i'm using the "Mute" setting. and i'm still getting the emails. i don't want to unsubscribe completely, i only want to get emails when i am directly mentioned
[2020-08-31 03:48:08] <MadLittleMods> oakkitten: "Mute" should do exactly what you're looking for. Can you check your notification settings for the room you are receiving emails for? Make sure to press "Apply" after you change it
[2020-08-31 15:26:53] <oakkitten> i triple checked that, and i even went to default notification settings and set it all to mute while ticking "Apply this setting to all existing conversations"
[2020-08-31 19:15:16] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
[2020-08-31 19:15:24] <MadLittleMods> I'm not sure why you would still be getting emails as I have tested myself with "Mute" and it works as expected. [<-CODE->] 
[2020-08-31 23:08:33] <oakkitten> i see that 6 is coming fromBITMASK_NOTIFY_ACTIVITY  | BITMASK_NOTIFY_MENTION, i'm not quite sure whyBITMASK_NOTIFY_ACTIVITYis there? and nope, i don't see the number there, i see a small green circle with a white + inside of it
[2020-09-01 00:34:20] <MadLittleMods> oakkitten: As a easy next debugging step, set that room to be specifically Mute instead of use your global setting
[2020-09-01 00:36:12] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->]  [<-CODE->] 
[2020-09-01 08:10:58] <elyase> how do you make line breaks (shift-enter) on a thread? is it possible at all?
[2020-09-01 17:05:14] <MadLittleMods> @elyase It's not possible in the text input on Gitter. You can track gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#2338But you can compose your message outside and paste it in
[2020-09-01 21:03:01] <oakkitten> i set python/typing to mute in the override section and i still got the mail. by the way, these notifications always say “100 unread messages (3 most recent)” which can't be right. for one the value 100 never changes, for another i did click on the room a few days ago and it just can't didn't get 100 unread messages since then. so perhaps something is stuck in that particular room?
[2020-09-01 21:03:51] <oakkitten> ...ifBITMASK_NOTIFY_ACTIVITYis something unrelated to emails andBITMASK_NOTIFY_MENTIONis, perhaps it would um help to name these separatly?
[2020-09-01 21:09:58] <oakkitten> i have an issue with threads: if i type something in a thread, and then switch to another conversation and back,the thread pane is closed. i would expect to remain open
the text that i typed in the thread pane is lost. i hate it when the text i type gets lost :<
[2020-09-01 21:13:24] <oakkitten> also, if iquicklyswitch from conversation A to conversation B and back, chat window would show conversation B while in the conversation list conversation A would be selected. i then can't switch to conversation A by clicking on conversation A, and have to slowly switch to another conversation and back
[2020-09-01 21:17:16] <oakkitten> also, if i open a pane on mobile, i can't press back to close it. as it takes the whole window, i'd expect back to close it instead of going further back (closing gitter)
[2020-09-01 22:47:50] <MadLittleMods> oakkitten: I've had this problem a couple times too. You can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-09-01 22:49:48] <MadLittleMods> oakkitten: What do you mean by pane? Is this on mobile web?
[2020-09-01 22:54:36] <MadLittleMods> Are you using the back button? Or just switching between rooms quickly? There could be a mismatch between when you trigger a switch on the left-menu and the events flowing out the realtime connection and back requesting the new room. [<-CODE->] 
[2020-09-01 23:52:35] <oakkitten> i am just clicking on conversation names. i have a slow computer
[2020-09-01 23:52:44] <oakkitten> aha i see
[2020-09-01 23:53:14] <oakkitten> sorry i meant to say thread pane
[2020-09-02 01:52:27] <MadLittleMods> oakkitten: I could see this being possible. The realtime pipe was already subscribed to the room but nothing came back down. Feel free to create an issue to track the mismatch, [<-LINK->] 
[2020-09-02 01:54:11] <MadLittleMods> oakkitten: Feel free to create an issue for history popping to close the thread pane, [<-LINK->] 
[2020-09-05 22:33:14] <avelino> looking at the changelog the last 2 releases are of data exports (user and channel), are you thinking of discontinuing gitter?My concern is communication with the open source projects that I'm maintaining (we use gitter as chat):https://github.com/prest/prest
https://github.com/editor-bootstrap/vim-bootstrapshould i worry?
[2020-09-05 22:33:41] <avelino> cc@MadLittleMods
[2020-09-06 19:26:05] <michaelJwilson> I've read the documentation, and I haven't found what I was after.  Is it possible to disable private messages and keep all rooms public to everyone?

[2020-09-07 16:56:09] <harishr1308_gitlab> I've got an issue with Gitter. While creating a room there are three things we configure:Under which community?
Name of the room
RepositoryI'd like to create a private room for all the users who have access to the repository hosted on GitLab. As mentioned in the release notes, it states that this module has been developed and released. However, the users in the community aren't able to access the same. They receive 404 errors. Can someone help me?
[2020-09-08 04:13:40] <MadLittleMods> avelino: Gitter still has life and will live on. Data exports have been on the back burner for a long time (since all of the GDPR stuff) and we're just getting to it now. We are going to continue working on PWA stuff, trying to consolidate the surface area of the mobile apps
[2020-09-08 04:14:40] <MadLittleMods> michaelJwilson: You can track this issue for disabling one to one conversations, [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-09-08 04:18:28] <MadLittleMods> puterkey: Can you post more of the stack trace? This makes me think that your docker container for Mongo isn't running or setup. What do you see when you rundocker ps --all?
[2020-09-08 04:25:14] <MadLittleMods> @harishr1308_gitlab What's the URL for the room so I can check that you set it up correctly? Choose the GitLab repo and select private when creating the room.When you send them a link, they need to be signed in with their GitLab account in order to access the room.You can manually invite non-GitLab users though.
[2020-09-08 07:12:27] <puterkey> Eric: Eastwood thinks a lot. I will check it. One more question: can I run gitter by command NPM start in host and Mongodb ES neo4j  started by Dcker?
[2020-09-08 08:12:10] <harishr1308_gitlab> Hi@MadLittleMods, Thank you for your response. I have created a private room and I've chosen the repository as you have stated. These users have logged into Gitter using the GitLab SSO. However, they have not been able to acceess the same. I shared the room URL [<-LINK->] using the share button and embedded the same on one of the rooms listed in the Community.
[2020-09-08 09:43:10] <VoidVolker> Hi! I have strange chat with user with nameTestDaxe&#x22;alert(33)(Trest11_gitlab) and I can't leave or hide this chat (when I press "hide this room" nothing happens). Looks like this is some kind of XSS attack in user name.
[2020-09-08 14:45:21] <MadLittleMods> puterkey: You need to rundocker-compose up -d --no-recreateto get the Docker contains for Mongodb and Elasticsearch to start
[2020-09-08 14:55:53] <MadLittleMods> harishr1308_gitlab: I just tested with a private Gitter room for a private GitLab project and was able to send a link to the room to another GitLab user and they were able to see the room. Are the other GitLab users members of [<-LINK->] ?
[2020-09-08 14:58:24] <MadLittleMods> VoidVolker: Once you press hide on the room, just visit another room and the room should be hidden from you.
[2020-09-08 15:29:23] <VoidVolker> O! Thanks, that works.
[2020-09-08 18:16:24] <harishr1308_gitlab> MadLittleMods: Yes! They all have maintainer level access! But they had a lot of difficulty searching for the room and when they accessed the link they received 404 errors.
[2020-09-08 22:23:49] <MadLittleMods> hmm, it should be working. We have some integration for this as well: [<-CODE->] <- [<-CODE->] 
[2020-09-08 22:25:14] <MadLittleMods> harishr1308_gitlab: What is the Gitter username of one of the users that wants to join but can't? Can you have them reply to this thread with permission for me to authenticate as them and try it out for myself? No credentials needs, just asking permission
[2020-09-09 13:35:49] <harishr1308_gitlab> MatLittleMods: I have a question, if I share the link for a private room does it give access to a user?
[2020-09-09 13:47:28] <harishr1308_gitlab> Assuming this user has maintainer level access to the repository.
[2020-09-09 13:49:54] <harishr1308_gitlab> So I created a new room for a repo and asked the user to access the room. She was able to do so.
[2020-09-09 13:50:04] <harishr1308_gitlab> @MatLittleMods I have a question, if I share the link for a private room does it give access to a user?So this works!
[2020-09-09 13:51:35] <harishr1308_gitlab> MadLittleMods: However, from what I understand, because a repo doesn't exist for some rooms. Sharing the room link does not give access to the user. This is obviously a privilege based thing right?
[2020-09-09 14:59:30] <MadLittleMods> harishr1308_gitlab: If the room is private without any repo association, then sharing a link will do nothing. You have to invite the user
[2020-09-09 15:00:42] <MadLittleMods> If the private room is associated with a repo, then GitLab users with access to the repo should be able to see the room
[2020-09-09 15:23:39] <harishr1308_gitlab> So I created a new room for a repo and asked the user to access the room. She was able to do so.@MadLittleMods So, as of now they are able to access the rooms. I am not entirely sure what went wrong while the person was creating the rooms and inviting users. But it doesn't seem to exist now.
[2020-09-09 15:34:04] <MadLittleMods> harishr1308_gitlab: Glad it's working now. If you're able to reproduce again, please create an issue with the steps to reproduce: [<-LINK->]

[2020-09-13 16:26:17] <MadLittleMods> puterkey: See [<-LINK->] 
[2020-09-13 23:16:27] <puterkey> How to config oauth automatically in  linux platform, the sam as Mac? Run obtain-secrets shell?
[2020-09-14 02:19:18] <MadLittleMods> puterkey: Correct,./obtain-secretsshell script will do the trick.
[2020-09-14 02:19:37] <MadLittleMods> For future questions, we should use [<-LINK->] which is more for the developer side of the webapp
[2020-09-14 09:17:03] <puterkey> OK. Thanks
[2020-09-14 12:44:37] <andre-dietrich> Hi, I tried to create a room for [<-LINK->] , but something did not work out and I cannot find it the error message is404. This is not the chat you're looking for. Sorry. :(... I cannot create another one nor delete the other ... any suggestions?
[2020-09-14 14:55:43] <MadLittleMods> andre-dietrich: You can see all of the rooms in your community via [<-LINK->] . Your room still exists [<-LINK->] and I see you are a member over there
[2020-09-14 19:22:12] <RobBednark> How do I search all the gitter docs?(I went to [<-LINK->] and could search the entire repo, but didn't see a way to only search the docs.  I could clone the repo andgit grep, but I'm hoping there's a way to do it in the web page)
[2020-09-14 19:25:04] <MadLittleMods> RobBednark: I looked a bit at [<-LINK->] and you could search for all of the markdown files like: [<-LINK->] 
[2020-09-14 19:26:36] <RobBednark> Perfect, thanks Eric!
[2020-09-14 19:38:43] <RobBednark>  [<-LINK->] How do I search for communities and rooms and seeallthe results?
[2020-09-14 21:19:17] <MadLittleMods> RobBednark: There isn't a way to see more. If you're looking for more CSS rooms, you could use [<-LINK->] 
[2020-09-16 23:01:52] <RobBednark> Thanks Eric.  I'm surprised there's that limitation.
[2020-09-16 23:03:08] <RobBednark> Yeah, I had looked at [<-LINK->] already, and expected to see a "general purpose" type of CSS room, and when I didn't see one, went to the search.
[2020-09-17 23:58:42] <r01t_gitlab> hi
[2020-09-17 23:59:35] <MadLittleMods> Hey@r01t_gitlab, this room is for Gitter support. Do you need help with anything?
[2020-09-18 00:00:09] <r01t_gitlab> no
[2020-09-18 00:00:14] <r01t_gitlab> thanks
[2020-09-25 03:26:32] <xbww> Hello everyone, is Gitter completely open source
[2020-09-25 05:32:33] <HaaseIT> Good morning. I cannot start the gitter desktop client on ubuntu 20.4 running kernel 5.8.9-050809-generic, error message is:[4240:4240:0925/071655.869781:ERROR:edid_parser.cc(102)] Too short EDID data: manufacturer id
[2020-09-25 05:33:29] <HaaseIT> Installed fromgitter_5.0.1_amd64.deb
[2020-09-25 16:35:28] <MadLittleMods> xbww: Many pieces are open souce like the [<-CODE->] but there are a few private projects mostly just because they were private before and we haven't removed the secrets from them yet
[2020-09-25 16:37:08] <MadLittleMods> HaaseIT: For reference, I ran into this error in [<-LINK->] but the app still ran
[2020-09-25 16:37:28] <MadLittleMods> Mind creating an issue with some more details: [<-LINK->] 
[2020-09-26 15:05:35] <bkmdev> hi!  very glad to hear you guys now have an IRC bridge  (simple is best!)  Trying it out now with my irc client and was wondering if "Server Password" was referring to a NickServ password?  or something else?  ex:  in irccloud.com, there is a field for "Server password"
[2020-09-26 15:06:12] <bkmdev> Is that the same thing?  ie:  is the former or latter?
[2020-09-26 15:12:41] <bkmdev> /msg NickServ do-you-exist?
[2020-09-27 22:10:01] <MadLittleMods> bkmdev: The server password is just the token you see on [<-LINK->] 
[2020-09-28 13:26:47] <Deshdeepak1> what are? irc and gitter
[2020-09-28 14:29:38] <MadLittleMods> Deshdeepak1: I'm not sure what you're asking. Can you restate your question in a different way?
[2020-09-28 16:54:35] <st-pasha> Hi everybody!I was trying to create a community for my GitHub repo. I pressed the button [Create community > do you want to start a community for one of your GitHub orgs/repos?], selected the repository from the list, and then immediately got the following error:The name of the GitHub repo you selected conflicts with the name of a GitHub org/user. When you select the a repo "h2oai/datatable", it fills out the community URI as "datatable" which clashes another GitHub org/user. Change your community URI to proceed.It seems like a typical "this name has already been taken" kind of message, but when I search for "datatable" rooms on Gitter, it cannot find a single one. So, I'm confused what the error message is trying to tell me, and how do I fix it.
[2020-09-28 19:50:45] <MadLittleMods> st-pasha: It may not exist on Gitter but [<-LINK->] exists which is where the clash is coming from
[2020-09-28 19:52:17] <st-pasha> so why can't I create Gitter communityh2oai/datatable?
[2020-09-28 19:52:50] <MadLittleMods> st-pasha: You can create theh2oaicommunity first. Then create thedatatableroom under that community
[2020-09-28 22:34:25] <st-pasha> Thanks Eric. I've tried following your advice, and I see that the h2oai community already exists: [<-LINK->] . However, when I click the "Create a Room" button, the "Community" dropdown does give me a choice to select the "h2oai" community, and thus I cannot create a room. Is there a way to find out who has the permissions to create a room within this community?
[2020-09-28 22:36:09] <MadLittleMods> Any member of https://github.com/orgs/h2oai/people should be able to admin the community.Try joining one of the existing rooms and creating a room.Otherwise see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-/blob/develop/docs/faq.md#why-isnt-my-github-organisation-or-repos-appearing
[2020-09-28 22:43:27] <st-pasha> Thanks Eric, it worked after I joined one of the existing rooms
[2020-09-28 22:44:06] <MadLittleMods> You're welcome! Glad you got it working :slight_smile:
[2020-09-30 03:13:24] <bkmdev> hi, thanks, yes, I had figured that much out & was actually asking whether irc.gitter.im's "Server Password" was actually referring to the NickServ password (NickServ being a service commonly offered by IRC servers to authenticate oneself to nicks you reserve), but it seems this isn't the case as this doesn't exist on irg.gitter.im.  Also, when I checked with irccloud.com, this does indeed correspond 1:1 to their "Server Password" field but is a paid feature, FYI.
[2020-09-30 03:14:46] <MadLittleMods> bkmdev: We'd be open to alternative ways to authenticate! Issue welcome to discuss and merge request if you're interested in contributing: [<-LINK->] 
[2020-09-30 07:43:21] <GitProK1> Hi everyone
[2020-09-30 07:43:49] <GitProK1> Does gitter comes in a mobile app?
[2020-09-30 12:28:22] <MadLittleMods> GitProK1: See [<-LINK->] 
[2020-09-30 13:19:13] <Half-Shot> (test)
[2020-09-30 13:23:28] <Half-Shot> test again
[2020-09-30 14:30:55] <wsdjeg> On the 30th of September, the Gitter web app was acquired by Element (a trading name of New Vector Ltd.). This means that your personal data, and all associated information assets, has been transferred over to the new Controller of your data.
[2020-09-30 14:30:59] <wsdjeg> ???!
[2020-09-30 14:31:21] <wsdjeg> does it mean, we can not use gitter after 30th?
[2020-09-30 14:31:41] <wsdjeg> we need to download element instead?
[2020-09-30 14:32:22] <MadLittleMods> @wsdjeg See https://matrix.org/blog/2020/09/30/welcoming-gitter-to-matrixNothing is going away. Gitter is still here :slight_smile:
[2020-09-30 14:34:32] <wsdjeg> Is there any differences?
[2020-09-30 14:36:29] <MadLittleMods> @wsdjeg Element is not replacing Gitter yet:in the medium/long term, it’s simply not going to be efficient for the combined Element/Gitter team to split our efforts maintaining two high-profile Matrix clients. Our plan is instead to merge Gitter’s features into Element (or next generations of Element) itself and then - if and only if Element has achieved parity with Gitter based on the above list - we expect to upgrade the deployment on gitter.im to a Gitter-customised version of Element. The inevitable side-effect is that we’ll be adding new features to Element rather than Gitter going forwards.
[2020-09-30 14:39:26] <wsdjeg> hmm, what I care about is my project chatting room, all users in it should be able to login gitter same as before.
[2020-09-30 14:42:09] <MadLittleMods> @wsdjeg All is good there! Nothing is changing about your community and how people access it.Gitter will stick around and get Matrix integration features so people can interact with everyone over in that ecosystem. Then we plan to merge Gitter's features into Element. Once there is feature parity,  Gitter will still be here but use the Element interface.
[2020-09-30 17:25:45] <ret394> I would advise circumspection to the best mad mod before posting such statements. Not everyone is as remarkably reliable, unusually transparent and exhaustively trustworthy as a project steward. Just because you are Mr Do Good Eastwood. This is just a drive-by.
[2020-09-30 17:38:57] <MadLittleMods> Thanks@ret394
[2020-10-01 08:44:01] <wsdjeg> MadLittleMods: Hi, thanks for working on gitter, but element is baned in china, I can not use it. I hope we can use gitter same as before.
[2020-10-01 13:40:12] <Daenyth> How can I make the announcement go away? The notification light on it is very distracting for me.
[2020-10-01 14:42:19] <MadLittleMods> Daenyth: I'll be turning off the mention dot in a few days. You could delete it from the DOM with the developer tools if you're familiar with that
[2020-10-01 14:43:51] <MadLittleMods> @wsdjeg I don't know how the China bans work and I don't think we have control over that to make a difference.Thanks for mentioning it as I didn't know before
[2020-10-01 14:50:18] <wsdjeg> Hi, I use gitter in my website, will it be breaked in the future?
[2020-10-01 14:50:26] <wsdjeg> my website is spacevim.org
[2020-10-01 14:50:51] <Daenyth> meh, ok
[2020-10-01 14:51:16] <MadLittleMods> You're website should be fine. [<-LINK->] will live on!
[2020-10-01 14:51:21] <wsdjeg> I means, can I use  " [<-LINK->] ", if gitter is merged into element?
[2020-10-01 14:52:40] <MadLittleMods> wsdjeg: See [<-LINK->] where this was discussed a bit
[2020-10-01 14:54:27] <MadLittleMods> You can keep using Gitter Sidecar even once the Matrix integration happens.If we  switch to the Element interface in the future, you might need to use the Element solution for embedding which isn't available yet. This will be a pre-requisite before we switch to using Element though.
[2020-10-01 14:58:30] <wsdjeg> ok
[2020-10-01 21:48:02] <ara4n> wsdjeg: : how is element banned in China? as an app, or the element.io website?
[2020-10-02 20:39:13] <MadLittleMods> Daenyth: Working on taking away the notification bubble now:gitlab-org/gitter/webapp!2028
[2020-10-03 11:20:51] <benomatis> on the mac app, clicking the top left hand side burger makes the ‘All conversations’ section to slide out, but the middle section will not take its place, it will just become a white block; I’m assuming that’s not intentional, is it? In fact, I think it does the same on the web app as well.
[2020-10-03 17:10:34] <MadLittleMods> @benomatis The macOS app just embeds the same webapp you would see in the browser so that is why you see the same thing.See gitlab-org/gitter/desktop#282 and the workaround at the bottom of the issue description
[2020-10-03 18:58:46] <benomatis> yes, this solved it, thank you
[2020-10-03 18:59:12] <MadLittleMods> You're welcome!
[2020-10-03 22:40:06] <HajaSChilds> Is there a way to make any of the communities or rooms  private - invite only, or accessible by repo members only?  Thanks in advance
[2020-10-04 02:26:41] <MadLittleMods> HajaSChilds: You can create private rooms and rooms only accessible by your org/group members, see [<-LINK->] 
[2020-10-04 03:40:02] <HajaSChilds> That's great thank you very much!
[2020-10-04 11:57:33] <j0hnmeow> I've changed my GH username and gitter kept the old one, is there a way to change it?
[2020-10-04 16:34:58] <MadLittleMods> MinerChAI: have you tried signing out and back in? [<-LINK->] 
[2020-10-04 17:12:33] <j0hnmeow> @MinerChAI have you tried signing out and back in? https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-/blob/develop/docs/accounts.md#gitter-accountThanks, works now
[2020-10-08 15:54:36] <christiansoe> is this community alive?
[2020-10-08 15:54:49] <j0hnmeow> Yes
[2020-10-08 15:55:00] <MadLittleMods> christiansoe: 
[2020-10-08 15:55:07] <christiansoe> cool
[2020-10-08 15:59:20] <MadLittleMods> christiansoe: This room is for Gitter support with the chat app itself, not a general developer chat or job posting board.
[2020-10-08 15:59:42] <christiansoe> MadLittleMods: Gotcha.
[2020-10-08 16:00:10] <christiansoe> Btw, very quick removal. Do you have an automation going there?
[2020-10-08 16:00:32] <MadLittleMods> christiansoe: It was just me removing it
[2020-10-08 16:15:55] <christiansoe> Are you a bot?
[2020-10-08 16:16:09] <christiansoe> Was quite fast ;)
[2020-10-08 16:17:43] <j0hnmeow> I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please contact the moderators of this subreddit if you have any questions or concerns.
[2020-10-08 16:42:54] <christiansoe> j0hnmeow: alright dude, let's keep it roll.
[2020-10-12 08:21:07] <kiti-k> How to mute gitter?
[2020-10-12 16:21:19] <MadLittleMods> kiti-nomad: See [<-LINK->] 
[2020-10-12 21:18:40] <bmd007> Any good docs on how to use this app? Like how to create new lines?
[2020-10-12 21:27:26] <eliotb_gitlab> Hmmm gitlab-org/ [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-10-12 21:30:00] <eliotb_gitlab> Ahh, I see, the link is still wrong

[2020-10-13 18:58:46] <oakkitten> when using gitter through irc, it seems that nick list is only displaying 32 people? can i change this number?
[2020-10-13 18:59:35] <MadLittleMods> oakkitten: You can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-10-13 19:01:55] <oakkitten> aha i see thanks
[2020-10-13 21:51:04] <tillias> hi folks, I have created space for one of my github repos and suddenly gitter-badger forked my repo. Is this expected behavior? Will it automatically cleanup this fork?
[2020-10-14 01:01:28] <MadLittleMods> tillias: The fork won't be cleaned up. If you want the fork removed, you can send an email tosupport@gitter.im
[2020-10-14 07:04:32] <tillias> Eric: , many thanks for fast reply. Before sending emails, is there any documentation available, why this fork is needed at a first place? I've looked through FAQ and google search results, but can't find any explanation what is the purpose of forking. Is this for statistical reasons only (e.g. how many projects on github do use gitter) or there is something more behind it?
[2020-10-14 19:02:23] <avelino> big thanks
[2020-10-14 19:19:35] <MadLittleMods> tillias: See [<-LINK->] 
[2020-10-14 19:19:56] <MadLittleMods> When you ask for a readme badge to be added to your project, we fork your project and send a pull request
[2020-10-14 19:20:46] <MadLittleMods> As an extra update here, in case you missed it, Gitter was acquired by Element [<-LINK->] 
[2020-10-14 20:38:16] <dstaley> Are there any details on how the new Matrixification will work? I'm mainly curious how room/org administration will work. Totally understand if that's not something that's been figured out yet, but I figured I'd ask.
[2020-10-14 20:40:15] <MadLittleMods> @dstaley There is a GitLab epic to track progress: https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/gitter/-/epics/10Lots of the technical details are in gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1684But can you be more specific about what you mean? Probably only Gitter users directly will be able admin a Gitter community or room
[2020-10-14 20:42:51] <dstaley> Ah okay, that's basically what I was curious about. I have an existing Matrix account, and I wanted to see if I could continue to use that to admin my Gitter rooms. So Gitter users will likely become something likedstaley_github:gitter.imto the rest of the Matrix network?
[2020-10-14 20:44:52] <dstaley> (just looked at the details,_githubwould be replaced by the userID
[2020-10-14 20:44:54] <MadLittleMods> dstaley: Pretty much,@username-5f762fc33936770384932b97:gitter.im. Reference: [<-LINK->] 
[2020-10-14 20:47:56] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] This sounds like a down the line feature and something we would welcome a merge request for.
[2020-10-14 20:50:12] <dstaley> Okay cool, seems everything looks like I expected! At this point everything is being done with a bridge, but I thought I read in the blog post that the endgoal is for Gitter to eventually be a Matrix homeserver. Is that correct?
[2020-10-14 20:59:05] <MadLittleMods> Then we’re going to build out native Matrix connectivity - running a dedicated Matrix homeserver on gitter.im with a new bridge direct into the heart of Gitterhttps://matrix.org/blog/2020/09/30/welcoming-gitter-to-matrix [<-CODE->] Once all of the history is on Matrix and Element(the glossy in-house Matrix client) has all of the features from Gitter, Gitter will use a re-skinned Element UI and become another Matrix client
[2020-10-15 13:29:23] <tillias> hello folks, are there any example of how to integrate travis-ci with gitter? Is it supported anyways?
[2020-10-15 13:31:05] <tillias> There is literally everything (slack, email, irc, campfire, hipchat) but gitter [<-LINK->] 
[2020-10-15 13:32:08] <tillias> There are webhooks though, not sure if that may be a solution?
[2020-10-15 13:32:51] <tillias> Many thanks, I can live with fork in the repo now :-D
[2020-10-15 15:14:21] <MadLittleMods> @tillias You can setup the Travis integration, https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-/blob/develop/docs/integrations.mdA general custom webhook integration also would work
[2020-10-15 18:47:31] <tillias> Thanks Eric, that is exactly what I'm looking for
[2020-10-15 22:32:03] <DuAtHome> Ni hao
[2020-10-15 22:34:51] <MadLittleMods> Hey@DuAtHome
[2020-10-16 04:29:59] <ret394> Don't know whether matrix docs is on GIthub. So, on https://www.matrix.org/docs/spec/#room-version-grammar, which grammar format is it? It's a pretty common question to pop up for a reader and I was stumped by it.If someone think it is obvious, well tell me when you have the regular ones and their extensions floating in your head. And if you use another format that no one else uses, well ... [<-CODE->] 
[2020-10-16 04:31:21] <ret394> I don't a lot about this or CS in general.
[2020-10-16 06:23:09] <MadLittleMods> @ret394 I'm confused what you're asking. It seems like the document you linked explicitly states the supported characters and has examples.Maybe ask in https://gitter.im/matrix-org/dev
[2020-10-16 09:25:28] <ret394> Thanks, they should understand it sooner.
[2020-10-16 13:00:15] <wsdjeg> MadLittleMods: hello, does gitter support pin message, I want to add a top message for a group. I think it is a useful feature for group management.
[2020-10-16 15:18:32] <MadLittleMods> wsdjeg: You can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-10-19 19:30:40] <Selda24> so how can i uninstall gitter on desktop to install stuff
[2020-10-19 19:31:13] <MadLittleMods> Selda24: See [<-LINK->] 
[2020-10-19 19:31:44] <Selda24> thanks

[2020-10-20 13:22:18] <yolomep> only in rooms she made
[2020-10-20 13:36:30] <yolomep> Basically, how do you make activity public?
[2020-10-20 13:36:44] <yolomep> Like in this room, how you can see the gitlab commits
[2020-10-20 13:41:35] <yolomep> Thanks, I figured it out, just needed to give my friend admin perms
[2020-10-22 14:16:35] <NextvidOfficial_twitter> hi guys, is there any way to implement in gitters api a gateway for telegram/discord? via irc export andimport@maybe? little info from a hongkonger :                                            telegram is bit what they say, they banned me as I were on the ground standing up against the communists in hk, they shadowban too inspite their claims)
[2020-10-22 14:18:06] <NextvidOfficial_twitter> so we took our team finally here, community not yet, I'm happy about any tip you might can come up with! thanks in advance
[2020-10-22 14:20:01] <NextvidOfficial_twitter> we would help in development if the rest of the team agrees, but I can't imagine this hasn't been done so I ask here, bye, hopefully 'till later.
[2020-10-22 16:49:52] <MadLittleMods> @NextvidOfficial_twitter This would probably be best implemented via Matrix. So you could setup a Gitter <-> Matrix <-> Telegram flow.We're currently developing a native Gitter <-> Matrix bridge but the current Gitter bot-bridge could suit your needs.Then to go from Matrix <-> Telegram, you could use one of these:https://t2bot.io/telegram/

[2020-10-23 07:37:46] <schauder> The...button which normally pop ups a little menu, which among other things allows to start a thread doesn't seem to work on unread messages. Problem is, the messages don't get marked as read for some reason. There for I'm not able to reply them. I tried it ich Chrome, Chrome Private Mode and Firefox. Any advice what I can do about it?
[2020-10-23 15:37:00] <MadLittleMods> @schauder As the messages come into view, they should be marked as read. There is a slight delay in the green going away but that is a just a CSS delay so you can still see which ones are unread as you scroll. [<-CODE->] When you say you not able to reply to them, what action are you using? Quote? Start thread reply?
[2020-10-23 21:13:32] <schauder> Correct, the menu did not open. I would have liked to use "start a thread".But I just tried again and the problem is now gone. ♂Thanks for your help.
[2020-10-27 14:31:38] <439bananas> why can't i create a community?
[2020-10-27 17:26:42] <MadLittleMods> @439bananas What error are you seeing?If you're trying to create a community for one of your GitHub orgs/repos and it's not appearing, see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-/blob/develop/docs/faq.md#why-isnt-my-github-organisation-or-repos-appearing
[2020-10-27 18:27:53] <NextvidOfficial_twitter> thanks @ Eric, thats helping already a lot
[2020-10-29 07:23:19] <MadLittleMods> @adeelafzal You probably want to chat in https://gitter.im/flutter/flutterThis room is for Gitter, the chat app itself, not general technical support.
[2020-10-29 13:51:56] <zsxa_gitlab> thanks
[2020-10-30 17:38:51] <lizzyhart5> is there i can ask someone ? about making a app or program idk what i would be making

[2020-11-03 16:55:28] <MadLittleMods> bgzhen64_gitlab: Normally you can sign out and back in to update your information but you are probably running into [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-11-03 16:55:43] <MadLittleMods> bgzhen64_gitlab: What's your new GitLab username so I can update things manually?
[2020-11-04 14:48:34] <bgzhen64_gitlab> my new username is BGZhen
[2020-11-04 14:48:49] <bgzhen64_gitlab> how about avatar? how should i change my avatar?
[2020-11-04 15:48:48] <MadLittleMods> bgzhen64_gitlab: I can update your avatar as well. [<-LINK->] doesn't seem to exist. Can you double-check your new username?
[2020-11-05 01:44:23] <bgzhen64_gitlab> my gitlab account is [<-LINK->] 
[2020-11-05 01:46:17] <bgzhen64_gitlab> but the username is BGZhen

[2020-11-07 17:17:44] <TacoGit> welcome to gitter
[2020-11-07 23:19:08] <fernand0> Hello, it's possible to delete a post with the API?. I'm looking at the docs and it is not clear to me.
[2020-11-08 03:47:25] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] Docs are here if you want to update them: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/docs/-/blob/c720c1956aaf2706b6ad982cedbd179b162d31d2/05.Messages-resource.md
[2020-11-08 10:24:54] <fernand0> Thanks, I'll test it and I'll try to propose an update.
[2020-11-08 12:48:07] <fernand0> It worked, thanks!
[2020-11-09 01:35:40] <DougHillmer> I just installed gitter, still trying to figure out what it is about and how to use it. First question, how do I change the font size for this window I am reading and typing in? Being the old geezer I am I need something easier on my eyes. I do not see any kind of settings menu.
[2020-11-09 10:18:19] <nafg> DougHillmer: just run it in your browser by going to gitter.im
[2020-11-09 10:19:13] <nafg> You can try zoom in shortcut on the app, ctrl-+, or ctrl-mousewheel
[2020-11-09 15:38:50] <MadLittleMods> DougHillmer: There is a workaround to increase the font-size in the desktop app but it is a bit involved: [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-11-10 03:22:38] <dheerajkarande_twitter> Can k
[2020-11-10 03:35:45] <dheerajkarande_twitter> I have a suggestion here, any gitter link should get open in a mobile app and should not open in a browser. Or atleast it should ask us where to open the link.
[2020-11-10 13:40:52] <MadLittleMods> dheerajkarande_twitter: You can track [<-ISSUE->] 
[2020-11-10 15:39:35] <eadventurous> Hello! I was testing some bot features in a private room. And for this posted 10+ messages with links with high frequency from a different account in that room. Now when I send messages from that account, they are not delivered at all.Was that account somehow banned? Though I have not seen any notification about it, and I tried to unban it in my room.
[2020-11-10 15:40:09] <MadLittleMods> eadventurous: It probably got caught in our spam detection. What is the username of the bot?
[2020-11-10 15:41:01] <eadventurous> soratest56: 
[2020-11-10 15:44:38] <MadLittleMods> eadventurous: I've unbanned your bot so you should be able to speak again. But you could get caught in the spam detection again.
[2020-11-10 16:05:42] <eadventurous> Thank you. Is there a way for a room administrator to mark the bot as non spam?
[2020-11-10 16:09:23] <eadventurous> The thing is I was testing a bridge bot, and so it may happen that someone posts spam messages in Telegram for example and the bot will be blocked in Gitter as it forwarded them.
[2020-11-10 16:10:43] <eadventurous> Maybe you can share some information about what type of behavoir would be considered spam? Then I would be able to set the delays for messages and other restrictions properly.
[2020-11-10 16:15:17] <eadventurous> Also is the user automatically unbanned after a few hours / days or is it required to always message support?
[2020-11-10 16:59:39] <MadLittleMods> @eadventurous Unbanning always requires manual intervention by support.You can track gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1958 for a future way to allow your bot free reign over a room.If you vary your messages, then it will be fine. Sending the exact same message will get you caught in the spam detection
[2020-11-11 04:59:21] <DougHillmer> MadLittleMods: Eric, thanks for the pointer I will go look at it.
[2020-11-11 10:06:56] <eadventurous> Ok, thank you for the information
[2020-11-12 17:56:26] <vit1251> Hello! How to remove room? I search answer in documentation and does not have any references about it.
[2020-11-12 17:57:44] <vit1251> Another one issue is leaving room is work with large delay or even does not work could you please show loading indicator and provide confirmation that application understand my request after select item.
[2020-11-12 18:54:45] <MadLittleMods> vit1251: If you are an admin of a room, you should be able to see the delete option in the room settings dropdown, docs: [<-LINK->] 
[2020-11-12 18:55:25] <MadLittleMods> vit1251: This is definitely a problem. Mind creating an issue: [<-LINK->] 
[2020-11-12 19:42:45] <adrianpkr_gitlab> Hello. I'm using my GitLab account to log into Gitter. Is there any way I can change my profile/avatar on Gitter?
[2020-11-12 20:33:50] <vit1251> @vit1251 If you are an admin of a room, you should be able to see the delete option in the room settings dropdown, docs: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-/blob/develop/docs/rooms.md#delete-a-roomI am was an admin in past that organization but this organization removed in 2014 (or late I can not remember right now) and removed all their repository from GitHub. Right now I see that chat's still available on my account.
[2020-11-12 20:36:55] <vit1251> @vit1251 This is definitely a problem. Mind creating an issue: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/-/issuesGot it. Could you please review or ask additional clarification gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#2631
[2020-11-12 22:13:58] <MadLittleMods> @vit1251 Please send an email to support@gitter.im with the details and any verification if possible that you did control that org before.We can try to get things sorted
[2020-11-12 22:15:56] <MadLittleMods> Looks good, thank you!
[2020-11-12 22:17:20] <MadLittleMods> @adrianpkr_gitlab Normally you can sign out and back in to update your information but you are probably running into gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1834If you update your avatar on GitLab, https://gitlab.com/adrianpkr, we can update your avatar here, just send an email to support@gitter.im
[2020-11-12 22:17:48] <MadLittleMods> I'll update your avatar now
[2020-11-12 22:19:32] <MadLittleMods> Updated your avatar. You may need to reload the app
[2020-11-13 21:09:28] <ohenley> Sometimes I write something, push Enter and the whole text just disappear, bye-bye gone in the ether. Anyone else? Am I rubbing it the wrong way?
[2020-11-13 22:35:19] <MadLittleMods> @ohenley  Do you see the message turn pending in the chat area or turn red if it fails to send?I haven't heard other reports of totally missing after sending. [<-CODE->] 
[2020-11-13 22:38:08] <ohenley> It happened 2 times, that is why I am wondering if I am doing something wrong. I think every time it happens that I take very long to finish my answer.
[2020-11-13 22:39:27] <ohenley> Also when it happened, I was just taking stuff for granted and did not detect any notifications of any sorts.
[2020-11-13 22:39:59] <ohenley> Sorry but where is the devtools?
[2020-11-14 13:18:22] <adrianpkr_gitlab> Sorry for the late reply, didn't get around to it yet. Thank you very much for you help Eric! Now my Avatar is visible.
[2020-11-15 07:42:20] <MadLittleMods>  [<-CODE->] Are you editing a message? I know there is an issue to better indicate when a message becomes non-editable, gitlab-org/gitter/webapp#1069
[2020-11-15 13:46:16] <Oldes> Hello! What tech is now Gitter using for the code colorization? What I could do to add support for not yet supported languages (Red and Rebol)?
[2020-11-15 17:59:46] <MadLittleMods> Oldes: We usehighlight.js. They may already support those languages, you just have to specify it manually```red. Here are the languages that are auto-detected: [<-LINK->] 
[2020-11-15 18:00:45] <Oldes> Highlight.js now accepts only external modules for new languages
[2020-11-15 18:01:00] <Oldes> Is it possible to enable these in Gitter?
[2020-11-15 18:02:04] <MadLittleMods> It's possible. Merge request welcome to that project but I am not sure of the implications now that may come up in review
[2020-11-15 18:03:48] <Oldes> Ok... I will first create a module for highlight.js
[2020-11-15 19:35:47] <pasha-pivo> Hi everybody! Does anybody know how to completely remove a community and release its URL so that it can be registered again?
[2020-11-16 12:08:15] <ohenley> Yes probably, I was editing a message. Thx for the link.
[2020-11-16 16:30:24] <MadLittleMods> pasha-pivo: See [<-LINK->] 
[2020-11-16 23:45:47] <Oldes> MadLittleMods: will this be enough? [<-LINK->] 
[2020-11-17 04:07:21] <MadLittleMods> Oldes: You'll also need to integrate that into thegitter-markdown-processorproject linked above with some tests to make sure it works and that we don't regress in the future
[2020-11-17 11:33:54] <Oldes> MadLittleMods: I would love to do it, but my concern is, if there is at least a little chance, that it will be accepted.. because HLJS does not accept new language definitions, they accept only modules now, so it's not just about adding one line into the list of enabled languages.
[2020-11-17 16:39:31] <MadLittleMods> Oldes: There is definitely a way forward to merge. Just don't know whether ourhighlight.jsversion is up to date enough for the modules and wondering about performance, etc
[2020-11-17 16:39:53] <MadLittleMods> If you have those details all figured out in a merge request, sounds good to me
[2020-11-17 16:40:30] <Oldes> Ok.. if there is some chance, I will try to fork the project and try it.
