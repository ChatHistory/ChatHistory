## LiveChat

### File organization
* `data/`
  * `raw/`: original chat history
  * `disentangle/`: chat history after disentangling
  * `manual/`: chat history after manual disentangling
* `images/`
  * `dd-test.pdf`: The comparison results are shown in Figure dd-test. The FF approach significantly outperforms the others on disentangling developer live chat. We can see that, FF approach achieves high NMI (avg. 0.74 ) and Shen-F scores (avg. 0.81), and medium-level scores on F1 (avg. 0.47) and ARI (avg. 0.57). Therefore, we select the FF model to disentangle all the utterances of the eight projects.
